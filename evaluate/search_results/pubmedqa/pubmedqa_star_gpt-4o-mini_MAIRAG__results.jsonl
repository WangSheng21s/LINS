{"question": "Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. RESULTS: The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (DeltaPsim). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells. CONCLUSIONS: Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant."]}
{"question": "Landolt C and snellen e acuity: differences in strabismus amblyopia?", "retrieved_passages": ["Background: Assessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. Patients and methods: 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. Results: Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between LR and SE. Conclusion: Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered."]}
{"question": "Syncope during bathing in infants, a pediatric form of water-induced urticaria?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Apparent life-threatening events in infants are a difficult and frequent problem in pediatric practice. The prognosis is uncertain because of risk of sudden infant death syndrome. CASE REPORTS: Eight infants aged 2 to 15 months were admitted during a period of 6 years; they suffered from similar maladies in the bath: on immersion, they became pale, hypotonic, still and unreactive; recovery took a few seconds after withdrawal from the bath and stimulation. Two diagnoses were initially considered: seizure or gastroesophageal reflux but this was doubtful. The hypothesis of an equivalent of aquagenic urticaria was then considered; as for patients with this disease, each infant's family contained members suffering from dermographism, maladies or eruption after exposure to water or sun. All six infants had dermographism. We found an increase in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in the two infants tested. The evolution of these \"aquagenic maladies\" was favourable after a few weeks without baths. After a 2-7 year follow-up, three out of seven infants continue to suffer from troubles associated with sun or water. CONCLUSION: \"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria."]}
{"question": "Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: The transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) is becoming the most popular procedure in the treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD), but overstretching of the anal sphincters remains a critical issue that may impact the continence. This study examined the long-term outcome of TERPT versus conventional transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for HD. METHODS: Records of 41 patients more than 3 years old who underwent a pull-through for HD (TERPT, n = 20; ABD, n = 21) were reviewed, and their families were thoroughly interviewed and scored via a 15-item post-pull-through long-term outcome questionnaire. Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 0 to 40: 0 to 10, excellent; 11 to 20 good; 21 to 30 fair; 31 to 40 poor. A 2-tailed Student t test, analysis of covariance, as well as logistic and linear regression were used to analyze the collected data with confidence interval higher than 95%. RESULTS: Overall scores were similar. However, continence score was significantly better in the ABD group, and the stool pattern score was better in the TERPT group. A significant difference in age at interview between the 2 groups was noted; we therefore reanalyzed the data controlling for age, and this showed that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between groups. CONCLUSION: Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn."]}
{"question": "30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIMS: Emergency surgery is associated with poorer outcomes and higher mortality with recent studies suggesting the 30-day mortality to be 14-15%. The aim of this study was to analyse the 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality following emergency laparotomy. We hope this will encourage prospective data collection, improvement of care and initiate strategies to establish best practice in this area. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent emergency laparotomy from June 2010 to May 2012. The primary end point of the study was 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year all-cause mortality. RESULTS: 477 laparotomies were performed in 446 patients. 57% were aged <70 and 43% aged >70 years. 30-day mortality was 12, 4% in those aged <70 years and 22% in those >70 years (p < 0.001). 1-year mortality was 25, 15% in those aged under 70 years and 38% in those aged >70 years (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care."]}
{"question": "Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Anchoring vignettes are brief texts describing a hypothetical character who illustrates a certain fixed level of a trait under evaluation. This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan. METHODS: We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "BACKGROUND: The effects of sleep duration on the development of mental illness remain controversial. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the effects of long or short sleep duration on psychological disorders, which could reveal new ways for preventing and treating mental health conditions cheaply. METHODS: Identifying published papers was accomplished by using the following five English databases on March 16, 2022: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science databases, and Scopus. Cross-sectional and cohort studies were considered if they evaluated the association of sleep duration with all kinds of mental illness in adults. We excluded case reports, editorials, narrative reviews, and studies without detailed information on sleep duration. Summary effect-size estimates were expressed as risk ratios (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals and were evaluated using random-effect models. Mantel-Haenszel's random-effects model was used to estimate the inconsistency index (I(2)) and Tau(2) index (measurement of heterogeneity). RESULTS: A total of 52 studies were included in this analysis, consisting of 14 cohort studies and 38 cross-sectional studies. These studies involved a combined sample size of 1,407,891 participants who met the inclusion criteria. Cohort (adjusted RR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.26-1.60, P < .001, I(2) = 37.6%, Tau(2) = 0.014) and cross-sectional studies (adjusted OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.57-1.77, P < .001, I(2) = 79.7%, Tau(2) = 0.060) concluded that short sleep duration increased mental disorder risks. The same conclusions were acquired in the subgroup analysis, especially for depression (adjusted RR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.24-1.65, P < .001, I(2) = 80.4%, Tau(2) = 0.082), anxiety (adjusted RR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.04-1.63, P = .002, I(2) = 0.0%, Tau(2) = 0.000), and PTSD (adjusted RR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.04-1.76, P = .022, I(2) = 24.1%, Tau(2) = 0.013) in cohort studies. The results of subgroup analysis indicated that long sleep duration was not a risk factor for depression (adjusted RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.98-1.34, P = .088, I(2) = 63.4%, Tau(2) = 0.045) and anxiety (adjusted RR = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.93-2.03, P = .114, I(2) = 0.0%, Tau(2) = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Short sleep duration, not long sleep duration, is an independent predictor of developing mental disorders, particularly anxiety and depression."]}
{"question": "Differentiation of nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis: are routine laboratory markers useful?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND/AIMS: Specific markers for differentiation of nonalcoholic (NASH) from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) are lacking. We investigated the role of routine laboratory parameters in distinguishing NASH from ASH. METHODS: Liver biopsies performed at our hospital over a 10-year period were reviewed, 95 patients with steatohepatitis identified and their data prior to biopsy reevaluated. The diagnosis NASH or ASH was assigned (other liver diseases excluded) on the basis of the biopsy and history of alcohol consumption (< 140 g/week). Logistic regression models were used for analysis. RESULTS: NASH was diagnosed in 58 patients (61%; 30 f) and ASH in 37 (39%; 9 f). High-grade fibrosis (59% vs. 19%, P < 0.0001) and an AST/ALT ratio > 1 (54.1% vs 20.7%, P = 0.0008) were more common in ASH. The MCV was elevated in 53% of ASH patients and normal in all NASH patients (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the MCV (P = 0.0013), the AST/ALT ratio (P = 0.011) and sex (P = 0.0029) as relevant regressors (aROC = 0.92). The AST/ALT ratio (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.00049) were independent predictors of high-grade fibrosis. Differences in MCV were more marked in high-grade fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "BACKGROUND: Obesity severely affects human health, and the accompanying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Rapid and non-invasive methods to detect this condition may substantially improve clinical care. METHODS: We used liquid and gas chromatography-quadruple time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC/GC-QTOF-MS) analysis in a non-targeted metabolomics approach on the plasma from morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery to gain a comprehensive measure of metabolite levels. On the basis of these findings, we developed a method (GC-QTOF-MS) for the accurate quantification of plasma alpha-ketoglutarate to explore its potential as a novel biomarker for the detection of NAFLD. RESULTS: Plasma biochemical differences were observed between patients with and without NAFLD indicating that the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes decreased beta-oxidation energy production, reduced liver function and altered glucose metabolism. The results obtained from the plasma analysis suggest pathophysiological insights that link lipid and glucose disturbances with alpha-ketoglutarate. Plasma alpha-ketoglutarate levels are significantly increased in obese patients compared with lean controls. Among obese patients, the measurement of this metabolite differentiates between those with or without NAFLD. Data from the liver were consistent with data from plasma. Clinical utility was assessed, and the results revealed that plasma alpha-ketoglutarate is a fair-to-good biomarker in patients (n=230). Other common laboratory liver tests used in routine application did not favourably compare. CONCLUSION: Plasma alpha-ketoglutarate is superior to common liver function tests in obese patients as a surrogate biomarker of NAFLD. The measurement of this biomarker may potentiate the search for a therapeutic approach, may decrease the need for liver biopsy and may be useful in the assessment of disease progression."]}
{"question": "Patient-Controlled Therapy of Breathlessness in Palliative Care: A New Therapeutic Concept for Opioid Administration?", "retrieved_passages": ["CONTEXT: Breathlessness is one of the most distressing symptoms experienced by patients with advanced cancer and noncancer diagnoses alike. Often, severity of breathlessness increases quickly, calling for rapid symptom control. Oral, buccal, and parenteral routes of provider-controlled drug administration have been described. It is unclear whether patient-controlled therapy (PCT) systems would be an additional treatment option. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether intravenous opioid PCT can be an effective therapeutic method to reduce breathlessness in patients with advanced disease. Secondary aims were to study the feasibility and acceptance of opioid PCT in patients with refractory breathlessness. METHODS: This was a pilot observational study with 18 inpatients with advanced disease and refractory breathlessness receiving opioid PCT. Breathlessness was measured on a self-reported numeric rating scale. Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores, Palliative Performance Scale scores, vital signs, and a self-developed patient satisfaction questionnaire were used for measuring secondary outcomes. Descriptive and interference analyses (Friedman test) and post hoc analyses (Wilcoxon tests and Bonferroni corrections) were performed. RESULTS: Eighteen of 815 patients (advanced cancer; median age = 57.5 years [range 36-81]; 77.8% female) received breathlessness symptom control with opioid PCT; daily morphine equivalent dose at Day 1 was median = 20.3 mg (5.0-49.6 mg); Day 2: 13.0 mg (1.0-78.5 mg); Day 3: 16.0 mg (8.3-47.0 mg). Numeric rating scale of current breathlessness decreased (baseline: median = 5 [range 1-10]; Day 1: median = 4 [range 0-8], P < 0.01; Day 2: median = 4 [range 0-5], P < 0.01). Physiological parameters were stable over time. On Day 3, 12/12 patients confirmed that this mode of application provided relief of breathlessness. CONCLUSION: Opioid PCT is a feasible and acceptable therapeutic method to reduce refractory breathlessness in palliative care patients."]}
{"question": "Is there a model to teach and practice retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: Although the retroperitoneal approach has been the preferred choice for open urological procedures, retroperitoneoscopy is not the preferred approach for laparoscopy. This study aims to develop a training model for retroperitoneoscopy and to establish an experimental learning curve. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen piglets were operated on to develop a standard retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy (RPN) training model. All procedures were performed with three ports. Intraoperative data (side, operative time, blood loss, peritoneal opening) were recorded. Animals were divided into groups A, the first eight, and B, the last seven cases. Data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: We performed fifteen RPNs. The operative time varied from 15 to 50 minutes (median 30 minutes). Blood loss varied from 5 to 100 mL (median 20 mL). We experienced five peritoneal openings; we had two surgical vascular complications managed laparoscopically. There was statistical difference between groups A and B for peritoneal opening (p = 0.025), operative time (p = 0.0037), and blood loss (p = 0.026). DISCUSSION: RPN in a porcine model could simulate the whole procedure, from creating the space to nephrectomy completion. Experimental learning curve was eight cases, after statistical data analysis. CONCLUSION: RPN in a porcine model is feasible and could be very useful for teaching and practicing retroperitoneoscopy."]}
{"question": "Israeli hospital preparedness for terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents: can the surge capacity and injury severity distribution be better predicted?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The incidence of large-scale urban attacks on civilian populations has significantly increased across the globe over the past decade. These incidents often result in Hospital Multiple Casualty Incidents (HMCI), which are very challenging to hospital teams. 15 years ago the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health defined a key of 20 percent of each hospital's bed capacity as its readiness for multiple casualties. Half of those casualties are expected to require immediate medical treatment. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the current readiness guidelines based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs. METHODS: A retrospective study of HMCIs was recorded in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) home front command and the Israeli National Trauma Registry (ITR) between November 2000 and June 2003. An HMCI is defined by the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health as >or=10 casualties or >or=4 suffering from injuries with an ISS>or=16 arriving to a single hospital. RESULTS: The study includes a total of 32 attacks, resulting in 62 HMCIs and 1292 casualties. The mean number of arriving casualties to a single hospital was 20.8+/-13.3 (range 4-56, median 16.5). In 95% of the HMCIs the casualty load was <or=52. Based on severity scores and ED discharges 1022 (79.2%) casualties did not necessitate immediate medical treatment. CONCLUSION: Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time."]}
{"question": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict outcome?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to delineate early respiratory predictors of mortality in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of children with malignant and ARDS who needed mechanical ventilation and were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit from January 1987 to January 1997. RESULTS: Seventeen children with ARDS and malignancy aged 10.5 +/- 5.1 years were identified. Six of the 17 children (35.3%) survived. Sepsis syndrome was present in 70.6% of all the children. Peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and ventilation index values could distinguish outcome by day 3. A significant relationship between respiratory data and outcome related to efficiency of oxygenation, as determined by PaO(2)/FIO(2) and P(A-a)O(2), was present from day 8 after onset of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS."]}
{"question": "Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of various postoperative nomograms to predict prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and to validate that they could predict aggressive biochemical recurrence (BCR). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), grade, and stage are the classic triad used to predict BCR after radical prostatectomy (RP). Multiple nomograms use these to predict risk of BCR. A previous study showed that several nomograms could predict aggressive BCR (prostate-specific antigen doubling time [PSADT] <9 months) more accurately than BCR. However, it remains unknown if they can predict more definitive endpoints, such as PCSM. METHODS: We performed Cox analyses to examine the ability of 4 postoperative nomograms, the Duke Prostate Center (DPC) nomogram, the Kattan postoperative nomogram, the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) nomogram, and the joint Center for Prostate Disease Research(CPDR)/Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) nomogram to predict BCR and PCSM among 1778 men in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database who underwent RP between 1990 and 2009. We also compared their ability to predict BCR and aggressive BCR in a subset of men. We calculated the c-index for each nomogram to determine its predictive accuracy for estimating actual outcomes. RESULTS: We found that each nomogram could predict aggressive BCR and PCSM in a statistically significant manner and that they all predicted PCSM more accurately than they predicted BCR (ie, with higher c-index values). CONCLUSION: Currently available nomograms used to predict BCR accurately predict PCSM and other more clinically relevant endpoints. Moreover, not only do they significantly predict PCSM, but do so with generally greater accuracy than BCR.", "Preoperatively predict the probability of Prostate cancer (PCa) biochemical recurrence (BCR) is of definite clinical relevance. The purpose of this study was to develop an imaging-based approach in the prediction of 3-years BCR through a novel support vector machine (SVM) classification. We collected clinicopathologic and MR imaging datasets in 205 patients pathologically confirmed PCa after radical prostatectomy. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to assess the association between MR findings and 3-years BCR, and modeled the imaging variables and follow-up data to predict 3-year PCa BCR using SVM analysis. The performance of SVM was compared with conventional Logistic regression (LR) and D'Amico risk stratification scheme by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) analysis. We found that SVM had significantly higher Az (0.959 vs. 0.886; p = 0.007), sensitivity (93.3% vs. 83.3%; p = 0.025), specificity (91.7% vs. 77.2%; p = 0.009) and accuracy (92.2% vs. 79.0%; p = 0.006) than LR analysis. Performance of popularized D'Amico scheme was effectively improved by adding MRI-derived variables (Az: 0.970 vs. 0.859, p < 0.001; sensitivity: 91.7% vs. 86.7%, p = 0.031; specificity: 94.5% vs. 78.6%, p = 0.001; and accuracy: 93.7% vs. 81.0%, p = 0.007).

Therefore, We concluded that imaging-based approach using SVM was superior to LR analysis in predicting PCa outcome. Adding MR variables improved the performance of D'Amico scheme.", "OBJECTIVE: To establish an external validation of the updated nomogram from Briganti et al., which provides estimates of the probability of specimen-confined disease using the variables age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), clinical stage and biopsy Gleason score in preoperatively defined high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 523 patients with high-risk PCa, as defined by d'Amico classification, undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) and bilateral lymph node dissection in one of two academic centres between 1990 and 2013. Specimen-confined disease was defined as pT2-pT3a node-negative PCa with negative surgical margins. The receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained to quantify the overall accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]) of the model in predicting specimen-confined disease. A calibration curve was then constructed to illustrate the relationship between the risk estimates obtained by the model (x-axis) and the observed proportion of specimen-confined disease (y-axis). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival. RESULTS: Patients' median age and PSA level were 64 years and 21 ng/mL, respectively. The definition of high-risk PCa was based on PSA level only in 38.3%, a biopsy Gleason score >7 in 34.5%, a clinical stage >T2b in 6.9%, or a combination of these two or three factors in 20.3% of patients. Positive surgical margins were observed in 43.6%, with a rate of 14.8% in pT2 cancers and lymph node metastasis in 12.1% of patients. pT stage was pT0 in 0.9%, pT2 in 28.9%, pT3a in 37.5% and pT3b-4 in 32.7% of patients. Overall, 44.4% of patients (N = 232) had specimen-confined disease. PSA and cT stage were independently predictive of specimen-confined disease. The median (range) 2-, 5-, and 8-year BCR-free survival rates were significantly higher in specimen-confined disease as compared with non-specimen-confined disease: 80.87 (73.67-86.29) vs 37.55 (30.64-44.44)%, 63.53 (52.37-72.74) vs 26.93 (19.97-34.36)% and 55.08 (41.49-66.74) vs 19.52 (12.50-27.70)%, respectively (P < 0.001). The ROC curve analysis showed relevant accuracy of the model (AUC 0.6470, 95% CI 0.60-0.69) although the calibration plot suggested that, for risks ranging from 0.3 to 0.5, the odds of extracapsular extension were underestimated. CONCLUSIONS: This external validation of the Briganti nomogram shows relevant accuracy, although the relative imprecision for intermediate risk may limit its clinical relevance. Our follow-up findings confirm the large proportion of specimen-confined PCa with good oncological outcomes in this heterogeneous subgroup of patients with high-risk PCa.", "Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease whose therapies frequently have adverse effects. Informed patient counseling regarding likely clinical outcomes is therefore important. In this systematic review we aimed to identify all external validations of tools that are used to predict clinical outcomes in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and evaluate which are optimum for clinical implementation. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from 2007 to 2016. Search terms related to the inclusion criteria were: prostate cancer, clinical outcomes, radical prostatectomy, and prognosis. Titles and abstracts were screened and relevant studies were advanced to full-text review. Reference lists were reviewed for further studies. The Centre for Evidence Based Medicine prognostic tool was used for critical appraisal. Seventy-three studies externally validated 13 pre- and 41 postoperative tools for the prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR), aggressive BCR, metastasis, and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Recommendations for clinical implementation were made on the basis of accuracy, cohort sizes, and consistency. The accuracy of recommended tools ranged from 68% to 79% and 72% to 92% among the largest validation cohorts for pre- and postoperative tools. For preoperative prognosis we recommended the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) and Stephenson nomograms for BCR, the CAPRA nomogram for aggressive BCR as well as metastasis, and the D'Amico criteria for PCSM. For postoperative prognosis we recommended the CAPRA-Surgery (CAPRA-S), Stephenson, Kattan, Duke prostate cancer (DPC), and the Suardi nomograms for the prediction of BCR, the DPC nomogram for aggressive BCR, the CAPRA-S and Eggener nomograms for metastasis, and the Eggener nomogram for PCSM. Use of these tools should help clinicians deliver accurate, evidence-based counseling to patients undergoing prostatectomy.", "BACKGROUND: Up to 30% of patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) are found to have features of aggressive disease at radical prostatectomy (RP).

Patients were stratified as low, intermediate, or high risk according to the D'Amico clinical risk criteria. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The rates of adverse pathology were reported, and the 5-yr risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) was calculated in the presence of aggressive disease. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The 5-yr risk of BCR in patients with extracapsular extension (n=937) was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40-46) overall but only 15% (95% CI, 11-22) for those who met the criteria for low risk (n=181). For the 473 patients with pathologic Gleason score 4+3, the risk of recurrence at 5 yr was 41% (95% CI, 37-46) overall, 13% (95% CI, 5-27) for low-risk men (n=41), 41% (95% CI, 35-47) for intermediate-risk men (n=287), and 51% (95% CI, 43-60) for high-risk men (n=145). Limitations include use of BCR as the study end point and surrogate for oncologic outcome in men who received curative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of pathologically unfavorable disease in patients eligible for AS is not informative as to the safety of this treatment modality. We question the relevance of adverse pathology as the end point for predictive tools designed to guide treatment decisions in low-risk PCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: The risk of biochemical recurrence associated with adverse pathologic findings at prostatectomy is reduced by approximately 50% in men with clinically low-risk prostate cancer."]}
{"question": "Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent?", "retrieved_passages": ["Aim: To ascertain whether recovery of visual function in amblyopic eyes is likely to occur when the fellow eye is lost as a result of age related macular degeneration.  Methods: The records of 465 patients with an established diagnosis of age related macular degeneration who had attended a specialist macular clinic between 1990 and 1998 were scrutinised. A full clinical examination and standardised refraction had been carried out in 189 of these cases on a minimum of two occasions. Cases were looked for where an improvement of one or more lines of either distance or near acuity was recorded in the eye unaffected by macular disease. In each one of these cases the improvement in visual acuity could not be attributed to treatment of other existing pathology. Results: 12 such cases were detected. In nine of these the eye showing improvement of acuity had a history of amblyopia. The mean improvement in distance and near acuity in amblyopic eyes by 12 months was 3.3 and 1.9 lines logMAR respectively. The improvement in acuity generally occurred between 1 and 12 months from baseline and remained stable over the period of follow up. Conclusions: Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "Amblyopia is a developmental disorder that affects vision. Characterized by neurodevelopmental alterations, amblyopia leads to physiological abnormalities in visual pathway development during early childhood, resulting in impaired vision occurring unilaterally or, less commonly, in both eyes. This condition occurs when cortical visual development fails in one or both eyes early in life. Amblyopia is commonly known as a \"lazy eye\" among the general public. If left untreated, amblyopia can lead to permanent vision loss in the affected eye, even if the underlying ocular pathology is later resolved. Among children and young adults, amblyopia is the most common cause of decreased vision in a single eye, affecting approximately 2% to 4% of children. The development of this condition is often linked to factors such as visual deprivation, inadequate quality of visual stimulation, or disruptions in binocular ocular interactions during the critical period of pediatric development. Patients with amblyopia typically exhibit reduced best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), which cannot be attributed to structural alterations in the eye. Amblyopia presents early in life when the developing visual system fails to transmit a clear and focused image to the visual cortex. Various factors such as media opacities, cataracts, strabismus, or anisometropic refractive errors, which create a developmental disadvantage for one eye over the other, can cause amblyopia. While amblyopia is typically unilateral, there are rare instances where it can occur bilaterally, especially in cases involving cataracts in both eyes or high refractive errors. The visual experiences during infancy and childhood play a pivotal role in shaping adult vision. Amblyopia is diagnosed by identifying diminished visual acuity in one or both eyes that is out of proportion to the structural abnormality of the eye, excluding any other visual disorders as the underlying cause. Diagnosis often involves identifying an interocular difference of 2 lines or more in visual acuity when refractive errors are corrected. In the case of young children, measuring visual acuity can be challenging. Still, it can be estimated by observing their reactions when one eye is covered, including assessing their ability to track objects with a single eye.", "AIM: To ascertain whether recovery of visual function in amblyopic eyes is likely to occur when the fellow eye is lost as a result of age related macular degeneration.

It is thought to develop early in life during the critical period of visual development. Early recognition of amblyogenic risk factors such as strabismus, refractive errors, and anatomic obstructions can facilitate early treatment and increase the chance for recovery of visual acuity. Multiple medical organizations endorse screening for visual abnormalities in children and young adults, yet only 20 percent of school-age children have routine vision screening examinations. Any child with a visual acuity in either eye of 20/40 or worse at age three to five years or 20/30 or worse at age six years or older, or a two-line difference in acuity between eyes, should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and definitive therapy. Treatment is started at the time of diagnosis and depends on the etiology. Treatment options for children with strabismus include patching and atropine drops. Children with refractive errors should be prescribed corrective lenses. Corneal lesions, cataracts, and ptosis require surgery. The success of therapy is highly dependent on treatment compliance. Patients and their parents should be educated about the need for regular follow-up and the risk of permanent vision loss.", "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Amblyopia is one of the most common causes of visual impairment in adults and children, and visual loss may be permanent if not treated in time. Though many studies have been done on occlusion therapy which is the mainstay in the treatment of unilateral amblyopia, discrepancies exist in literature about quantification of treatment and follow up measures. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the factors responsible for the successful outcome of treatment and the optimum time required for the same in children with unilateral amblyopia. METHODS: Baseline characteristics of 63 verbal patients with unilateral amblyopia (strabismic, anisometropic, mixed) referred to the Strabismus and Amblyopia Clinic at the Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, New Delhi between September 2001 to December 2002 who improved to the desired level of visual acuity after treatment for amblyopia in the mentioned time period, were analyzed to assess for factors that directly or indirectly influenced the optimum visual rehabilitation and the average duration of therapy required for the same. The evaluation included assessment of the baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and refractive status in both eyes, the age at presentation, the type of amblyopia present, fixation pattern in the amblyopic eye, inter-eye visual acuity difference, and evaluation of compliance through a parental diary system. RESULTS: Baseline BCVA in the amblyopic eye was similar in all the three groups. Patients with anisometropic amblyopia showed a quicker response to therapy. Compliance to treatment was the major factor affecting the overall time required for a successful outcome in most cases. The overall time required for the treatment to be successful (including the period of maintenance) was about 1,089 h. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: This hospital-based study showed that the average duration of occlusion therapy to achieve stable isoacuity was 7.2 months with an average occlusion of 6-7 h/day. Compliance to therapy was the most important factor affecting the duration of therapy. With increasing emphasis on paediatric eye diseases, amblyopia is at last getting its due importance as a cause of treatable correctable paediatric visual impairment which can have lifelong repercussions, both in terms of individual disability and financial burden to the society if not treated in time. As the therapy is simple and effective if started early, mass awareness, visual screening, and counselling would go a long way in treating the patients, thus decreasing the prevalence of amblyopia in the country.", "Amblyopia is a preventable cause of visual loss in children that may be permanent unless it is detected and treated early. It may be caused by strabismus, refractive errors, or cataracts. Primary strabismus may lead to loss of vision from amblyopia and the loss of binocularity. Secondary strabismus may be a sign of primary visual loss in one or both eyes. The most serious disorder that may present as secondary strabismus is retinoblastoma. It is imperative to detect retinoblastoma early because of its morbidity and mortality. Amblyopia is detected by assessing the visual acuity of each eye. Strabismus is detected by using the corneal light reflex test and the cover test. Focusing problems are detected by assessing the visual acuity and the red reflex. Cataracts and retinoblastoma may be detected by examining the red reflex of the eye. Treatment of amblyopia consists of correcting the amblyogenic factor with appropriate glasses and surgery. The preferred eye is patched with an adhesive patch to stimulate visual development in the amblyopic eye. The pediatrician plays a crucial role in the early detection of amblyopia, strabismus, and cataracts. The key to successful visual outcome is early recognition by the pediatrician, referral to the pediatric ophthalmologist, and prompt treatment."]}
{"question": "Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor: is the standard of effective analgesia reachable in all women?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Social and cultural factors combined with little information may prevent the diffusion of epidural analgesia for pain relief during childbirth. The present study was launched contemporarily to the implementation of analgesia for labor in our Department in order to perform a 2 years audit on its use. The goal is to evaluate the epidural acceptance and penetration into hospital practice by women and care givers and safety and efficacy during childbirth. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This audit cycle measured epidural analgesia performance against 4 standards: (1) Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor to all patients; (2) Acceptance and good satisfaction level reported by patients and caregivers. (3) Effectiveness of labor analgesia; (4) No maternal or fetal side effects. RESULTS: During the audit period epidural analgesia increased from 15.5% of all labors in the first trimester of the study to 51% in the last trimester (p < 0.005). Satisfaction levels reported by patients and care givers were good. A hierarchical clustering analysis identified two clusters based on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) time course: in 226 patients (cluster 1) VAS decreased from 8.5+/-1.4 before to 4.1+/-1.3 after epidural analgesia; in 1002 patients (cluster 2) VAS decreased from 8.12+/-1.7 before (NS vs cluster 1), to 0.76+/-0.79 after (p < 0.001 vs before and vs cluster 2 after). No other differences between clusters were observed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 114 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients receiving surgery alone or adjuvant M-VEC. The authors evaluated HER2 immunoreactivity using immunohistochemical staining and explored the influence of pathological parameters and HER2 immunoreactivity on progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific overall survival (OS) using univariate and multivariate Cox's analyses. RESULTS: Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder had a significantly higher frequency of HER2 immunoreactivity than that of the upper urinary tract (60.7 vs. 20.7%, p < 0.0001). Overall, nodal status was a strong and independent prognostic indicator for clinical outcome. The HER2 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with PFS (p = 0.02) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.005) in advanced urothelial carcinoma patients. As for patients with adjuvant M-VEC, HER2 immunoreactivity was a significant prognostic factor for PFS (p = 0.03) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.02) using univariate analysis, but not multivariate analysis, and not for patients receiving watchful waiting. CONCLUSIONS: HER2 immunoreactivity might have a limited prognostic value for advanced urothelial carcinoma patients with adjuvant M-VEC."]}

There have been no studies investigating its effect on hearing. METHODS: Thirty guinea pigs were divided into three groups: a control group, a halofantrine therapeutic dose group and a halofantrine double therapeutic dose group. One cochlea specimen from each animal was stained with haematoxylin and eosin and the other with toluidine blue. RESULTS: No changes were detected in the control group. The halofantrine therapeutic dose group showed loss and distortion of inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells, and loss of spiral ganglia cells. In the halofantrine double therapeutic dose group, the inner and outer hair cells were distorted and there was loss of spiral ganglia cells. CONCLUSION: Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug."]}

We sought to identify the correlations of VAT and SAT between area-based measures at different anatomic locations with volumetric measurements to identify the optimal anatomic site, and to relate measurements at this site with metabolic risk factors. METHODS: We measured SAT and VAT volumes across the total imaging volume, whereas we measured SAT and VAT area at seven predefined anatomic landmarks in 200 participants from the Framingham Heart Study (mean age 54 years, 50% women) who underwent abdominal multi-detector CT. Correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between area measurements and volumes as well as metabolic risk factors stratified by gender. RESULTS: Area-based measurements of SAT and VAT obtained at all anatomic landmarks were strongly associated with SAT and VAT volumes (all r>0.93, P<0.0001 and r>0.87, P<0.0001, for women and men; respectively). Consistently, area-based measurements of SAT and VAT obtained at L(3/4) were most strongly associated with volumetric measured VAT and SAT independent of age (both r=0.99 in men, r=0.96 for SAT and r=0.99 for VAT in women, all P-value <0.0001) and were similarly correlated with risk factors compared with SAT and VAT volumes (all P<0.05 for fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure).

METHOD: Participants who underwent non-contrast abdominal scan by quantitative CT (QCT) were enrolled from May 2021 to October 2021. The VAT area (cm(2)) at different anatomic sites as upper-pole, lower-pole, and hilum of the kidney, intervertebral disc of L2/L3 and L5/S1, and umbilical level were measured on QCT PRO BMD workstation (Mindways QCT PRO workstation). The total VAT volume (cm(3)) from the upper pole of kidney to the L5/S1 intervertebral disc of the pelvis (abdominopelvic region) was obtained by using Siemens Healthineers Syngo via Frontier cardiac risk assessment. Regression models were used to identify the optimal single-slice in different gender for estimating VAT volume. Statistical significance was established at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Total of 311 Chinese participants including 179 men [age, 55.1 +/- 14.9 years; body mass index (BMI), 24.2 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2); total VAT volume, 2482.6 +/- 1276.5 mL] and 132 women [age, 54.3 +/- 14.9; BMI, 23.5 +/- 2.9; total VAT volume, 1761.5 +/- 876.4].

SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 389 healthy Chinese subjects aged 19-63 years underwent lumbar spine QCT scans. The cross-sectional area of total adipose tissue and VAT were measured using the tissue composition module of the software (QCT Pro, Mindways) at each intervertebral disc level from T(12)/L(1) to L(5)/S(1), as well as at the umbilical level. The total VAT volume was defined as the fat areas multiplied by the height of vertebral body for all six slices. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the correlation between single-slice VAT areas and the total VAT volume. Moreover, the optimal anatomic site for a single slice to estimate the total VAT volume was identified by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: The cross-sectional area of VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) measured at each anatomic site was all highly correlated with the total VAT volume and the total SAT volume (r = 0.89-0.98). Additionally, the VAT area measured at the L(2)/L(3) level showed the strongest correlation with the total VAT volume (r = 0.98, P < 0.001).

This validation study investigated agreement between BIA and CT for the assessment of VF in adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Between 2015 and 2016 in China. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 414 adults (119 men and 295 women) aged 40-82 years.

BIA measurements of visceral fat level were compared with CT VFA findings using scatter plots and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Scatter plots showed poor agreement between BIA and CT-derived visceral fat measurements in both sexes (R=0.387-0.636). ROC curves gave optimum figures for sensitivity and specificity of 65% and 69% in women and 76% and 70% in men, respectively, for BIA to discriminate between adults with normal levels of VF and those with visceral obesity determined by CT.

A recent study indicated that the traditionally measured VAT area at L(4)-L(5) is not the VAT area with the highest correlation with total VAT volume. At present, it is unknown whether the area with the highest correlation is also the most strongly associated with obesity-related health risk. OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to establish which VAT slice area(s) are most strongly associated with obesity-related health risk indicators. DESIGN: The subjects were a convenience sample of healthy adults who completed whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The correlations, with appropriate adjustments, were examined between individual MRI slice VAT areas and fasting serum/plasma triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), glucose, insulin and blood pressure. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 283 healthy men (age (mean+/-s.d.) 41.9+/-15.8 years; BMI, 26.0+/-3.2 kg/m(2); VAT, 2.7+/-1.8 L) and 411 women (age, 48.1+/-18.7 years; BMI 27.0+/-5.4 kg/m(2); VAT, 1.7+/-1.2 L). After adjusting for age, race, menopause status, scan position and specific blood analysis laboratory, VAT area at L(4)-L(5) had lower correlations with most metabolic risk factors including serum/plasma TG, HDL, glucose, insulin and blood pressure than VAT volume in both men and women. The VAT areas 10 and 15 cm above L(4)-L(5) in men had higher or equal correlations with health risk measures than VAT volume. In women, the VAT area 5 cm above or below L(4)-L(5) and total VAT volume had similar correlations with health risk measures. CONCLUSIONS: An appropriately selected single slice VAT area is an equally reliable phenotypic marker of obesity-related health risk as total VAT volume. However, in both men and women the VAT slice area at the traditional L(4)-L(5) level is not the best marker of obesity-related health risk."]}
{"question": "Necrotizing fasciitis: an indication for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The accepted treatment protocol for necrotizing fasciitis (NF) consists of extensive surgery and wide spectrum antibiotics. Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) has been recommended as adjuvant therapy for NF, improving patient mortality and outcome. However, the beneficial effect of HBO for NF remains controversial. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome in 37 patients treated for NF between 1984 and 1993 was carried out. The mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical excision and antibiotics alone. RESULTS: The two groups were found to be similar with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score for disease's severity on presentation. The mortality rate among the HBO-treated patients was 36%, as opposed to 25% in the non-HBO group. The mean number of surgical debridements required per patient was significantly higher in the HBO group: 3.3 compared with 1.5 in the non-HBO-treated patients. Although the average length of hospitalization for survivors was shorter for the HBO group, the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "BACKGROUND: Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) require immediate radical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics and intensive care. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) may be performed adjunctively, but unequivocal evidence for its benefits is still lacking. METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center study including 192 patients with necrotizing fasciitis or Fournier's gangrene to assess in-hospital mortality and outcome dependent on patient, disease and treatment characteristics with or without HBOT. RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate was 27.6%. Factors associated with increased mortality according to multivariate analysis were higher age, affection of multiple or problem localizations (odds ratio (OR) = 2.88, P = 0.003), ineligibility for HBOT despite clinical indication (OR = 8.59, P = 0.005), pathogens in blood cultures (OR = 3.36, P = 0.002), complications (OR = 10.35, P < 0.001) and sepsis/organ dysfunction (OR = 19.58, P < 0.001). Factors associated with better survival included vacuum-assisted wound closure (OR = 0.17, P < 0.001), larger number of debridements (OR = 0.83, P < 0.001) and defect closure with mesh graft (OR = 0.06, P < 0.001) or flap (OR = 0.09, P = 0.024).

In the subgroup ineligible for HBOT, survival was significantly worse (36.4%, P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: These results point to a benefit from HBOT for treatment of NSTI in critically ill patients.", "INTRODUCTION: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is discussed as an adjuvant option to treat necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI). While the Federal Joint Committee decided in 2007 not to support HBOT for the indication necrotizing fasciitis and Fournier's gangrene, it was decided to accept HBOT for treatment of clostridial myonecrosis for the German health insurance. Thus, in Germany necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is not a confirmed indication for HBOT. Against this background the cons of the clinical benefits of HBOT should be formulated. METHODS: A literature search (MEDLINE/EMBASE/COCHRANE/manual search) using the keywords \"necrotizing fasciitis\", \"Fournier's gangrene\", \"necrotizing cellulitis\", \"necrotizing soft tissue infections\" as well as \"hyperbaric medicine\", \"hyperbaric therapy\" and \"hyperbaric treatment\" was carried out. An analysis of the spatial distribution of German hyperbaric oxygen chambers enabling intensive care (HOC-IC) was made. RESULTS: A total of 250 articles with n=2,556 NSTI patients (n=993 treated by HBOT) was found and 50% of the articles were case reports or series. There were only ten retrospective studies comparing the effects of HBOT with non-HBO treatment and none of them verified the benefit of HBOT in NF patients. In Germany only nine hyperbaric oxygen chambers (HOC-IC) enable intensive care. Currently, patient data are not included in scientific studies or multicenter studies, while studies assessing the benefit with higher evidence levels have been required for more than 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: The previously published human clinical studies do not confirm any therapeutic benefit of HBOT in NF patients. Any time delay in the start of surgical therapy by HBOT would not be acceptable. In Germany a comprehensive clinical care with HOC is not possible. On average the additional costs of HBO treatment for NF patients is approximately 8,000-25,000 <euro>/patient which is not generally reimbursed by health insurance companies. Initializing a register study to assess the benefit of HBOT in NF patients appears feasible and is urgently needed.", "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the use of 100% oxygen at pressures greater than atmospheric pressure. Today several approved applications and indications exist for HBOT. HBOT has been successfully used as adjunctive therapy for wound healing. Non-healing wounds such as diabetic and vascular insufficiency ulcers have been one major area of study for hyperbaric physicians where use of HBOT as an adjunct has been approved for use by way of various studies and trials. HBOT is also indicated for infected wounds like clostridial myonecrosis, necrotising soft tissue infections, Fournier's gangrene, as also for traumatic wounds, crush injury, compartment syndrome, compromised skin grafts and flaps and thermal burns. Another major area of application of HBOT is radiation-induced wounds, specifically osteoradionecrosis of mandible, radiation cystitis and radiation proctitis. With the increase in availability of chambers across the country, and with increasing number of studies proving the benefits of adjunctive use for various kinds of wounds and other indications, HBOT should be considered in these situations as an essential part of the overall management strategy for the treating surgeon.", "Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) is the inhalation of 100% oxygen at pressures > 1.4 times atmospheric pressure. Hyperbaric oxygen can be delivered in monoplace (single person) or multiplace (multi-person) chambers. Most clinical HBO2 exposures are between 2 and 2.4 atm abs for approximately 2 hours. Hyperbaric oxygen causes the blood and tissue oxygen levels to increase, reduces the volume of intravascular and tissue bubbles (to treat decompression sickness [DCS] and arterial gas embolism [AGE]), and accelerates wash-out of other gases, such as nitrogen or carbon monoxide (CO), which is important for DCS, AGE, and CO poisoning. Hyperbaric oxygen favorably modulates ischemia-reperfusion injury by transiently inhibiting neutrophil-endothelial interactions, which is important for patients with DCS, AGE, CO poisoning, and potentially other acute ischemic conditions. Because of enhanced oxygen delivery, HBO2 is used for acute crush injury, ischemic flaps and grafts, acute central retinal arterial occlusion, other acute arterial occlusions, and idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Hyperbaric oxygen has antimicrobial effects and is offered for patients with limb- or life-threatening infections, such as clostridial gas gangrene and necrotizing fasciitis. The most common US indication for HBO2 is the treatment of ischemic wounds (eg, diabetic lower extremity wounds, late effects of radiation, and refractory osteomyelitis). In ischemic wounds, HBO2 can deliver sufficient oxygen to the nonhealing wound to stimulate angiogenesis and healing through multiple mechanisms, including increased collagen production, increased growth factor receptor numbers, upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor, increased circulating endothelial progenitor cells, and improvement in neutrophil-mediated host defense. Clinical trials support efficacy of HBO2 for acute CO poisoning, diabetic lower extremity wounds, crush injury, and radiation necrosis. Most hyperbaric chambers are associated with wound care centers and may be hospital based or nonhospital based. We review some of the disorders treated with HBO2 that hospital-based clinicians may be asked to evaluate."]}

RESULTS: The histological analysis revealed that w-d HCCs had lower incidences of fibrous capsule formation (P<0.01), when compared to l-d HCCs. There were no significant differences in the incidence of intrahepatic metastasis, or portal vein invasion. In a resected specimen of w-d HCC, barium sulfate and gelatin were injected into portal vein and a transparent specimen was made. The transparent specimen showed that the portal vein in the tumor seemed to be intact. Microscopically, cancer cell infiltration into the fibrous frame of the portal tract was present. There were no significant differences in the disease free survival between the two groups. An analysis of tumor volume doubling time in recurrent foci suggested that minute cancerous foci had been present at the time of operation. CONCLUSIONS: W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs."]}
{"question": "Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Accurate and updated information on airborne pollen in specific areas can help allergic patients. Current monitoring systems are based on a morphologic identification approach, a time-consuming method that may represent a limiting factor for sampling network enhancement. OBJECTIVE: To verify the feasibility of developing a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach, an alternative to optical analysis, as a rapid, accurate, and automated tool for the detection and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen taxa. METHODS: The traditional cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-based method was modified for DNA isolation from pollen. Taxon-specific DNA sequences were identified via bioinformatics or literature searches and were PCR amplified from the matching allergenic taxa; based on the sequences of PCR products, complementary or degenerate TaqMan probes were developed. The accuracy of the quantitative real-time PCR assay was tested on 3 plant species. RESULTS: The setup of a modified DNA extraction protocol allowed us to achieve good-quality pollen DNA. Taxon-specific nuclear gene fragments were identified and sequenced. Designed primer pairs and probes identified selected pollen taxa, mostly at the required classification level. Pollen was properly identified even when collected on routine aerobiological tape. Preliminary quantification assays on pollen grains were successfully performed on test species and in mixes. CONCLUSIONS: The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods."]}
{"question": "Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Lymphedema may be identified by simpler circumference changes as compared with changes in limb volume. METHODS: Ninety breast cancer patients were prospectively enrolled in an academic trial, and seven upper extremity circumferences were measured quarterly for 3 years. A 10% volume increase or greater than 1 cm increase in arm circumference identified lymphedema with verification by a lymphedema specialist. Sensitivity and specificity of several different criteria for detecting lymphedema were compared using the academic trial as the standard. RESULTS: Thirty-nine cases of lymphedema were identified by the academic trial. Using a 10% increase in circumference at two sites as the criterion, half the lymphedema cases were detected (sensitivity 37%). When using a 10% increase in circumference at any site, 74.4% of cases were detected (sensitivity 49%). Detection by a 5% increase in circumference at any site was 91% sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: An increase of 5% in circumference measurements identified the most potential lymphedema cases compared with an academic trial."]}
{"question": "Colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases: does global management at the same centre improve results?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Synchronous liver metastases (SLM) occur in 20% of colorectal cancers (CRC). Resection of SLM and CLC can be undertaken at different centres (separate management, SM) or at the same centre (global management, GM). METHODS: Retrospective study of SLM and CRC resections carried out during 01/2000 - 12/2006 by SM or GM, using a combined or delayed strategy. RESULTS: Morphologic characteristics and type of CRC and SLM resection were similar for the GM (n = 45) or SM (n = 66) groups. In patients with delayed liver resection (62 SM, 17 GM), chemotherapy prior to liver surgery was used in 92% and 38% of SM and GM patients (P < 0.0001) and the median delay between procedures was 212 and 182 days, respectively (P = 0.04). First step of liver resection was more often performed during colorectal surgery in the GM group (62 vs. 6% for SM, P < 0.0001) and the mean number of procedures (CRC+SLM) was lower (1.6 vs. 2.3, P = 0.003). Three-month mortality was 3% for GM and 0% for SM (n.s.). Overall survival rates were 67% and 51% for SM and GM at 3 years (n.s.), and 35 and 31% at 5 years (n.s.). Disease-free survival to 5 years was higher in SM patients (14% vs. 11%, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection."]}
{"question": "Is it appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Kidneys from elderly donors tend to be implanted in recipients who are also elderly. We present the results obtained after 10 years of evolution on transplanting elderly kidneys into young recipients. METHODS: Ninety-one consecutive transplants are studied, carried out in our center with kidneys from cadaver donors older than 60 years implanted in recipients younger than 60 years. The control group is made up of 91 transplants, matched with those from the study group, whose donor and recipient were younger than 60 years. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups with regard to recipient age, sex, cause of death and renal function of the donor, hepatitis C and cytomegalovirus serologies, cold ischemia time, tubular necrosis, immediate diuresis, need for dialysis, human leukocyte antigen incompatibilities, hypersensitized patients, acute rejection, waiting time on dialysis, and days of admission. Survival in both groups at 1, 5, and 10 years was 97.6%, 87.2%, and 76.6% vs. 98.8%, 87.5%, and 69.5% for the patient (P=0.642), 92.9%, 81.3%, and 64.2% vs. 93.9%, 76.4%, and 69.5% for the graft (P=0.980), and 94.4%, 92.6%, and 77.4% vs. 94.3%, 86.7%, and 84.4% for the graft with death censured (P=0.747), respectively. Creatininaemias at 1, 5, and 10 years were 172, 175, and 210 vs. 139, 134, and 155 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors."]}
{"question": "Do Surrogates of Injury Severity Influence the Occurrence of Heterotopic Ossification in Fractures of the Acetabulum?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between injury severity surrogates and other patient factors with the development and severity of heterotopic ossification (HO) following open reduction internal fixation of acetabular fractures treated with a posterior approach. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Academic level 1 trauma center. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty-one patients who were treated through a posterior approach with a minimum of 6-month radiographic follow-up were identified from an acetabular fracture database. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The occurrence and severity (Brooker Grade III/IV) of HO 6 months postsurgery. RESULTS: Length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), non-ICU LOS >10 days, and HO prophylaxis with external radiation beam therapy (XRT) were significantly associated with the development of HO in a multivariate model [ICU LOS: 1-2 days, odds ratio (OR) = 4.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-18.25; 3-6 days, OR = 4.1, 95% CI, 1.27-13.27; >6 days, OR = 11.7, 95% CI, 3.24-42.22; non-ICU LOS >10 days (vs. 0-6 days): OR = 7.6, 95% CI, 2.6-22.25; XRT HO prophylaxis: OR = 0.29, 95% CI, 0.10-0.85]. Other variables evaluated in multivariate modeling not significantly associated with development and severity of HO included age, gender, mechanism of injury, injury severity score, presence of neurologic injury, Letournel fracture type, occurrence of hip dislocation, interval from injury to surgery, operative time, and estimated blood loss. CONCLUSIONS: Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS >10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.

METHODS: Pregnant women (n=35) and trainee midwives (n=36) were randomly presented with one of four PISs where the title and font of the PIS had been manipulated to create four experimental conditions (i.e., Double Fluent; Double Awkward; Fluent Title-Awkward Font; Awkward Title-Fluent Font). After reading the PIS, participants rated their perceptions of the intervention (i.e., Attractiveness, Complexity, Expected Risk, Required Effort) using five-point Likert scales. RESULTS: A 4x2 factorial multivariate analysis of variance revealed that pregnant women rated the Double Awkward condition as significantly more complex than the Double Fluent (p=.024) and Awkward Title-Fluent Font (p=.021) conditions.

{"question": "Is there a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women?", "retrieved_passages": ["The androgen milieu and sexual desire in women seem to be tightly linked because they both decline with age. However, we are still missing a cut-off plasma level for androgens (total testosterone, free testosterone) or androgen precursors (androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS)) to diagnose androgen deficiency in clinical practice. Apart from the complex multidimensional nature of sexual desire across the reproductive lifespan, the correlation between measurements of testosterone and specific signs and symptoms has been difficult because, according to guidelines, most available assays are unreliable at baseline and under hormonal treatments. Recent data obtained with accurate methods based on mass spectrometry to measure total testosterone levels found a significant positive association with sexual desire, arousal and masturbation in midlife US women across the menopausal transition. Even in a European cohort of healthy women aged 19-65 years, sexual desire, measured with a validated questionnaire, correlated overall with free testosterone and androstenedione measured with mass spectrometry. Collectively, these data support the therapeutic use of testosterone for low desire and sexual dysfunction in those clinical conditions in which androgen deficiency may be accurately diagnosed.", "PURPOSE: To assess the impact of serum androgen levels and androgen receptor CAG polymorphism on sexual function in 45 healthy midlife women living in a heterosexual relationship. METHODS: Cross-sectional study [Cantonal Ethics Committee Bern (Ref.-Nr. KEK-BE: 087/13)]. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association between androgen serum levels, androgen receptor CAG polymorphism and sexual function was assessed by the FSFI-d questionnaire. RESULTS: In our cohort of healthy, midlife, well-educated, middle-class, mostly postmenopausal women living in a heterosexual satisfying partnership, sexual function was perceived to remain stable or to decline during menopausal transition with sexual desire scoring lowest (FSFI-d 3.3 +/- 0.9). Androgen serum levels did not correlate with sexual function. Mean CAG repeat number was 21.6 +/- 1.9. There was a highly inverse though non-significant correlation between female sexual function and AR CAG repeat polymorphism with specifically higher numbers of CAG repeats being significantly positively correlated to more frequent or more severe pain during or after sexual intercourse. CONCLUSION: The AR polymorphism is a non-negligible factor in female sexual function. Future studies on female sexual (dys)function should incorporate its assessment.", "INTRODUCTION: For women, the correlation between circulating androgens and sexual desire is inconclusive. Substitution with androgens at physiological levels improves sexual function in women who experience decreased sexual desire and androgen deficiency from surgical menopause, pituitary disease, and age-related decline in androgen production in the ovaries. Measuring bioactive testosterone is difficult and new methods have been proposed, including measuring the primary androgen metabolite androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G). AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between serum levels of androgens and sexual desire in women and whether the level of ADT-G is better correlated than the level of circulating androgens with sexual desire. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study including 560 healthy women aged 19-65 years divided into three age groups. Correlations were considered to be statistically significant at P<0.05. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Sexual desire was determined as the total score of the sexual desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index. Total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and ADT-G were analyzed using mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Sexual desire correlated overall with FT and androstenedione in the total cohort of women. In a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years with no use of systemic hormonal contraception, sexual desire correlated with TT, FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS. In women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. No correlations between ADT-G and sexual desire were identified. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "There is increasing evidence that women at the outset of sexual activity do not need to have sexual desire, as in 'drive', and that many do not distinguish desire from arousal. Multiple modes of investigation confirm poor correlation between women's subjective arousal and measured genital congestion. Suggested revisions to the DSM-IV definitions of sexual disorder have been published: there is now need to align interview assessments and screening questionnaires with contemporary understanding of women's sexual response. Whereas the psychological factors associated with women's sexual function and resilience to biological insults and external stressors are well documented, the role of biological factors is less clear. Variations in the rate of decline of adrenal and ovarian pro-hormones, activity of converting enzymes in peripheral cells, sensitivity of androgen and estrogen receptors and cerebral production of sex steroids may all be involved. Thus there is great complexity underlying the question of sex hormone supplementation, and in particular, little clarity as to which women have decreased brain and/or peripheral androgen activity. When psychosexual etiological factors appear to be minimal and investigational testosterone supplementation is considered, it would be appropriate to target women with disordered arousal and desire in keeping with the recently recommended revised definitions.", "Sexual desire is typically higher in men than in women, with testosterone (T) thought to account for this difference as well as within-sex variation in desire in both women and men. However, few studies have incorporated both hormonal and social or psychological factors in studies of sexual desire. The present study addressed how three psychological domains (sexual-relational, stress-mood, body-embodiment) were related to links between T and sexual desire in healthy adults and whether dyadic and solitary desire showed associations with T. Participants (n = 196) were recruited as part of the Partnering, Physiology, and Health study, which had 105 men and 91 women who completed questionnaires and provided saliva for cortisol and T assays. T was positively linked to solitary desire in women, with masturbation frequency influencing this link. In contrast, T was negatively correlated with dyadic desire in women, but only when cortisol and perceived social stress were controlled. Replicating past findings, no significant correlations between T and desire in men were apparent, but these analyses showed that the null association remained even when psychological and confound variables were controlled. Men showed higher desire than women, but masturbation frequency rather than T influenced this difference. Results were discussed in terms of challenges to assumptions of clear links between T and desire, gendered approaches to T, and the unitarity of desire."]}

We investigated the association between IBR, complications and adjuvant chemotherapy delivery. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of patients in an academic breast service, who underwent mastectomy, with or without reconstruction, and received adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Comparisons were made between 107 patients who received IBR and 113 who received mastectomy alone. Those receiving IBR were on average younger, with lower body mass index (BMI) and better prognoses. Overall complication rates were comparable (mastectomy alone: 45.1% versus IBR: 35.5%, p = 0.2). There was more return to surgery in the IBR group with 11.5% of tissue expanders requiring removal, whilst more seromas occurred in the mastectomy group. There was no significant difference in the median time to chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "Breast reconstruction has become increasingly popular over the past 20 years. There is concern that it may mask locoregional recurrence or that immediate reconstruction may compromise adjuvant treatments. We review available evidence regarding its oncological safety. The literature consists almost entirely of single institution, small retrospective reviews with variable follow-up and varying conclusions. Most reviews suggest that breast reconstruction does not adversely affect disease-free or overall survival and that there is no significant delay in presentation with recurrent disease. Three retrospective series compared chemotherapy delivery after immediate breast reconstruction with controls having mastectomy alone. No delay in chemotherapy delivery or effect on dose intensity was demonstrated. Irradiation of a prosthetic implant has been shown to increase the rate of capsular contracture; irradiation of autogenous tissue reconstruction is usually well tolerated.", "INTRODUCTION: In the management of breast cancer radiation therapy plays a substantive role in decreasing local recurrence and increasing overall survival. Still, there exists controversy concerning compromised radiation delivery plans and suboptimal delivery after immediate autologous breast reconstruction. Our study aims to assess the oncologic safety of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) with a Deep inferior epigastric perforator flap (DIEP), in the setting of adjuvant radiation therapy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis using a prospectively maintained database of all consecutive women undergoing breast reconstruction with a DIEP flap in the setting of radiation therapy. Independent variables included patient age, cancer stage, tumor grade type and subtype, adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, diabetes mellitus, and tobacco use. Main outcome variables were: local recurrence, distant metastasis, patient demise and total flap failure. RESULTS: From July 2008 to January 2014, and out of 450 patients who underwent reconstruction with a DIEP flap, 62 were considered eligible. Thirty patients (48%) had IBR followed by radiation therapy and 32 (52%) had delayed reconstruction preceded by radiation therapy. The two groups were comparable with respect to the independent variables. Local recurrence occurred in 3.2% of patients; 3.3% in the immediate group and 3.1% in the delayed (P=0.963). Distant metastasis occurred in 6.4% of patients: 10% in the immediate group and 3.1% in the delayed (P=0.27). Breast cancer related mortality occurred in 4.8%: 6.7% in the immediate group and 3.1% in the delayed (P=0.52). CONCLUSION: Immediate reconstruction with a DIEP flap in the setting of adjuvant radiation therapy is an acceptable approach and appears not to influence the oncologic efficacy of radiation treatment. Further prospective studies are advocated.", "BACKGROUND: Immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) is routinely offered to improve quality-of-life for women requiring mastectomy, but there are concerns that more complex surgery may delay adjuvant oncological treatments and compromise long-term outcomes.

METHODS: Consecutive women undergoing mastectomy +/- IBR for breast cancer July-December, 2016 were included. Patient demographics, operative, oncological and complication data were collected. Time from last definitive cancer surgery to first adjuvant treatment for patients undergoing mastectomy +/- IBR were compared and risk factors associated with delays explored. RESULTS: A total of 2540 patients were recruited from 76 centres; 1008 (39.7%) underwent IBR (implant-only [n = 675, 26.6%]; pedicled flaps [n = 105,4.1%] and free-flaps [n = 228, 8.9%]). Complications requiring re-admission or re-operation were significantly more common in patients undergoing IBR than those receiving mastectomy. Adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy was required by 1235 (48.6%) patients. No clinically significant differences were seen in time to adjuvant therapy between patient groups but major complications irrespective of surgery received were significantly associated with treatment delays.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Breast and plastic surgery centres in the UK performing mastectomy with or without (+/-) IBR will be invited to participate in the study through the trainee research collaborative network. All women undergoing mastectomy +/- IBR for breast cancer between 1 July and 31 December 2016 will be included. Patient demographics, operative, oncological and complication data will be collected.

{"question": "Major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence: Does comorbidity lead to poorer outcomes of depression?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Comorbid major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), particularly in adolescents, have been shown to be associated with poorer subsequent MD outcomes. METHODS: Longitudinal data were used to model associations between a four-level classification of MD/AUD during the period 15-18 years (neither; MD-only; AUD-only; comorbid MD/AUD) and MD over the period 18-35 years. These associations were then adjusted for confounding by a series of factors measured in childhood. RESULTS: The three disorder groups had rates of adult MD during the period 18-35 years that were significantly (p<.05) higher than that of the group with no disorder. Furthermore, those in the comorbid MD/AUD group had significantly (p <.05) higher rates of adult MD than those in the AUD-only group, and marginally (p <.10) higher rates of adult MD than those in the MD-only group. After adjustment for confounding, the difference in rates of adult MD between the MD-only group and the MD/AUD group were no longer statistically significant. The factors that explained the associations were gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse. LIMITATIONS: The data were obtained by self-report, and may have been subject to biases. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD."]}

{"question": "Does a 4 diagram manual enable laypersons to operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme\u00ae?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Bystander resuscitation plays an important role in lifesaving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A significant reduction in the \"no-flow-time\", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme(R) (LMAS) in the manikin. METHODS: An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 +/- 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25). CONCLUSION: In manikin laypersons could insert LMAS in the correct direction after onsite instruction by a simple manual with a high success rate. This indicates some basic procedural understanding and intellectual transfer in principle. Operating errors (n = 91) were frequently not recognized and corrected (n = 77). Improvements in labeling and the quality of instructional photographs may reduce individual error and may optimize understanding."]}
{"question": "Can we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The aim of this work is to assess a previously described slit-lamp biomicroscopy-based method (SLBM) for measuring pupil diameter and compare it to Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP). METHODS: Two examiners performed three repeated measurements with each instrument in 40 healthy eyes. We determined the agreement of SLBM and CIP, intraobserver and interobserver repeatabilities, and interobserver concordance (kappa) and SLBM ability for detecting pupil sizes over 6.0 mm. RESULTS: The mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) pupil diameter was 5.81 +/- 0.70 mm with SLBM and 6.26 +/- 0.68 mm with CIP (p = 0.01) averaging both examiner's results. Mean differences between the SLBM and CIP were -0.60 mm and -0.30 mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings (p = 0.02), and they were very similar using the first reading. Intraobserver reproducibility: the width of the 95% LoA ranged from 1.79 to 2.30 mm. The ICCs were 0.97 and 0.92 for SLBM, and 0.96 and 0.90 for CIP. Interobserver reproducibility: the width of the LoA ranged from 1.82 to 2.09 mm. Kappa statistics were 0.39 and 0.49 for the first and mean SLBM readings, respectively, and 0.45 for both the first and mean CIP readings. Sensitivity and specificity of SLBM for detection of pupils larger than 6 mm ranged from 55.56% to 73.68% and from 76.19% to 95.45%, respectively. The best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity ranged from 5.4 mm to 6.2 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6 mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM."]}

While their arguments promoting autonomy and consent might be superficially appealing, their claim of high procedural risks and negligible benefits seem one-sided and contrast with high quality evidence of low risk and lifelong benefits. Extensive literature reviews by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in developing evidence-based policies, as well as risk-benefit analyses, have found that the medical benefits of infant NTMC greatly exceed the risks, and there is no reduction in sexual function and pleasure. The BMA's failure to consider the medical benefits of early childhood NTMC may partly explain why this prophylactic intervention is discouraged in the United Kingdom. The consequence is higher prevalence of preventable infections, adverse medical conditions, suffering and net costs to the UK's National Health Service for treatment of these. Many of the issues and contradictions in the BMA guidance identified by Lempert et al stem from the BMA's guidance not being sufficiently evidence-based. Indeed, that document called for a review by others of the medical issues surrounding NTMC. While societal factors apply, ultimately, NTMC can only be justified rationally on scientific, evidence-based grounds. Parents are entitled to an accurate presentation of the medical evidence so that they can make an informed decision. Their decision either for or against NTMC should then be respected.", "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Major circumcision complications are rare; however, circumcision arouses distress in some special cases. The present study aimed to compare infancy and childhood regarding the frequency and relative risk of early and late complications of circumcision. METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort data analysis including 240 neonates and 240 children referred for circumcision from 2015 to 2021. All circumcisions were performed using the surgical dorsal-ventral slits method. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the relative risk (RR) of complications at a confidence Interval of 95%. RESULTS: The mean age was 19.32 +/- 6.5 days for the neonates and 46.1 +/- 8.8 months for the children. In general, complications occurred in 61 boys (12.7%), 40 neonates (8.3%), and 21 children (4.4%) (p<0.001). Bleeding was the most common early complication in six neonates (2.5%) and three children (1.3%), and meatal stenosis was the most common late complication in 10 neonates (4.2%) and four children (1.6%). Meatal web was observed in 11 neonates (4.6%) and four children (1.6%), and the incomplete removal of the prepuce, as \"not very satisfactory\", was also noticed in nine neonates (3.75%) and three children (1.3%). The circumcision complications were significantly more frequent in neonates than in children (RR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.46-4.71, p<0.001). The neonatal circumcisions had a significant risk of the incomplete removal of the prepuce, meatal web, and meatal stenosis compared to children (RR = 3, 95% CI 5.83-10.81, p<0.04; RR = 2.75, 95% CI 0.9-8.3, p<0.03; RR = 2.5, 95% CI 0.8-7.75, p<0.04, respectively). CONCLUSION: The risk of complications is higher in neonates than children. The incomplete removal of prepuce, meatal web, and meatal stenosis are significantly higher in neonates than in children. Before prohibiting or recommending this procedure, practitioners should provide comprehensive information about its risks and benefits. Parents should weigh up the risks and benefits and make the best decision regarding their personal beliefs and customs.", "INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, almost 100% of boys are born with penises with a \"hood\" called prepuce or foreskin. In the course of the boy's life, the prepuce can be circumcised, can become affected by diseased (e.g., phimosis), or a can become infected and hurt the neonate (and his sexual partner) in adulthood. The objectives of this report are to: 1) review the state, function, fate, and care of the prepuce in childhood, with focus on the neonate, in Canada; 2) understand the current practice of childhood male circumcision in terms of age, indications, performers, techniques, outcomes, and education; and 3) consider ways to sustain a good healthcare professional-parental dialogue for safe practices that are accessible, acceptable, and culturally sensitive in the care of the prepuce. METHODS: A literature review was carried out in the English language through the major databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection, LILAC, WHO/UNAIDS, Clinical Trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov), Google Scholar, and grey literature. Search words included: prepuce, diseases of prepuce, prepuce in the neonate, prepuce in the neonate in Canada, male circumcision, childhood male circumcision, neonatal circumcision, neonatal circumcision in Canada, complications of neonatal circumcision in Canada, and circumcision adverse events. RESULTS: From 1970-1999, three of 10 Canadian newborn males were circumcised for religious, cultural, and medical reasons. The rest of the neonates, if alive, are living with their prepuce; <4% expected to require treatment for afflictions of the prepuce at some point. There are several providers of circumcision with different levels of training and competencies and using a diversity of devices and techniques. Neonatal and childhood circumcision in Canada is carried out to fulfill parental wishes, as well as for medical, religious, and cultural reasons. Appropriate informed consent and education regarding choices of care of the neonatal prepuce and genitals are vital. CONCLUSIONS: Going by current prevalent rate of circumcision in Canada, most Canadian newborn males are likely to live out their lives with an intact prepuce. Despite the age-old debate, childhood circumcision is likely to remain. There is need for careful and proper discussion of the potential risks and benefits, including alternatives, costs, and personal/psychological factors. Acceptance, access, and judicious choices in a culturally sensitive environment will offer the Canadian neonate desirable care of the prepuce for life."]}
{"question": "Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether problems in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) can add to conventionally used clinical measurements in helping to predict a diagnosis of dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up. DESIGN: Multicenter prospective cohort study. SETTING: Memory clinics in Europe. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 55 and older without dementia. MEASUREMENTS: IADLs were measured using pooled activities from five informant-based questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relation between IADLs and dementia. Age, sex, education, depression, and cognitive measures (Mini-Mental State Examination and verbal memory) were included in the model. RESULTS: Five hundred thirty-one participants had baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments; 69 (13.0%) of these had developed dementia at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year follow-up, 481 participants were seen, of whom 100 (20.8%) had developed dementia. Participants with IADL disabilities at baseline had a higher conversion rate (24.4%) than participants without IADL disabilities (16.7%) (chi-square = 4.28, degrees of freedom = 1, P = .04). SEM showed that IADL disability could help predict dementia in addition to the measured variables at 1-year follow-up (odds ratio (OR) = 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.51-3.13) and 2-year follow-up (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.33-3.33).

A nomogram was developed previously for determining the risk of 3-year probable AD conversion in aMCI. OBJECTIVE: To compare the probable AD conversion rates with cognitive and neurodegenerative changes for 2 years from high- and low risk aMCI groups classified using the nomogram. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted in Korea. A total of patients were classified as high- or low-risk aMCI according to the nomogram and followed-up for 2 years to compare the annual conversion rate to probable AD and brain structure changes between the two groups. RESULTS: In total, 176 (high-risk, 85; low-risk, 91) and 160 (high-risk, 77; low-risk, 83) patients completed the 1-year and 2-year follow-up, respectively. The probable AD conversion rate was significantly higher in the high-risk (Year 1, 28.9%; Year 2, 46.1%) versus low-risk group (Year 1, 0.0%; Year 2, 4.9%, both p < 0.0001). Mean changes from baseline in Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery-Dementia Version, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Box, and Korean version of the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores and cortical atrophy index at Years 1 and 2 were significantly greater in the high-risk group (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The high-risk aMCI group, as determined by the nomogram, had a higher conversion rate to probable AD and faster cognitive decline and neurodegeneration change than the low-risk group. These real-world results have clinical implications that help clinicians in accurately predicting patient outcomes and facilitating early decision-making.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03448445)."]}
{"question": "Does the Simultaneous Use of a Neuroendoscope Influence the Incidence of Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The relationship between the use of an endoscope during ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) procedures and infection remains poorly defined. In this study, we sought to analyze whether the simultaneous use of an endoscope could in fact increase the infection rate associated with VPS procedures. METHODS: This study included 438 VPS procedures, 49 in which an endoscope was used (11.2%) and 389 in which an endoscope was not used (88.8%). The infection rates in these 2 main groups were calculated and compared. Subsequently, 4 new groups were created, composed of patients with a shunt inserted for the first time (groups 1A and 1B) and patients with a shunt reviewed or inserted for a second time (groups 2A and 2B). Groups 1A and 2A comprised patients in whom an endoscope was used simultaneously with VPS surgery, and groups 1B and 2B comprised patients in whom an endoscope was not used. These groups were compared to determine the infection rate. RESULTS: The overall infection rate was 18.5%, including 22.4% in the groups in which an endoscope was used and 18% in those in which an endoscope was not used (P = 0.449). Groups 1A and 1B and groups 2A and 2B were matched for possible intervening risk factors. The infection rate was 28.6% in group 1A and 16.2% in group 1B (P = 0.27), and 20% in group 2A and 19.8% in group 2B (P = 0.977).

{"question": "Is a specialised training of phonological awareness indicated in every preschool child?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: In a prospective study 218 preschool children were enrolled (stratified in 2 training programs, one specialized for phonologic awareness in order to prevent dyslexia, the other consisting in training of general perception) during the last year of kindergarten. After finishing the first grade 131 children were compared in their reading and writing abilities. RESULTS: In the whole group only a slight difference was found between both training modalities concerning their writing abilities. However, children with a history of hearing loss, actual hearing loss or pathologic middle ear findings profited most from the specialized training program compared to the control in their reading abilities. CONCLUSION: A specialized training program to improve phonologic awareness as a basis for reading and writing in every kindergarten and preschool child seems to be unnecessary. However, children with temporary hearing deficits benefit from such a program. For all other children general perception training may be sufficient."]}
{"question": "Is the combination with 2-methoxyestradiol able to reduce the dosages of chemotherapeutices in the treatment of human ovarian cancer?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: The endogenous estradiol metabolite, 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME), has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of cell growth and a strong anti-angiogenic substance. We investigated for the first time whether in vitro combinations of 2ME with various chemotherapeutic compounds may result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells. METHOD: As a model two different human ovary cancer cell lines were used. All cell lines were incubated with equimolar concentrations of 2ME (0.8-25 microM) and the chemotherapeutics epirubicine, doxorubicine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil and mafosfamide. Proliferation was measured after four days using the ATP-chemosensitivity test. RESULTS: For both ovary cancer cell lines a significant additive effect of 2ME with epirubicine and carboplatin was observed at the lower concentration range of these chemotherapeutic substances. CONCLUSION: 2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer."]}
{"question": "Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach for planning knee revision surgery?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Reconstructing the natural joint line in knee revision surgery improves clinical and functional outcome but may be challenging when both cartilage and bone were removed during previous operations. Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images. METHODS: Using scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p value of </=0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Two hundred knees of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) were examined. For the fibular head, the mean difference between the treated and the control knee was 0.0 mm with narrow confidence limits ranging from -1.1 to 1.1. CONCLUSION: As a new assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance between the fibular head and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. This parameter is the first tibia-related landmark for assessing the JL, which advantageously corresponds to the tibia-first technique in revision surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic Study, Level II.", "There is a tendency of orthopaedic surgeons to elevate joint line (JL) in revision total knee arthroplasty (RTKA). Here, we ascertain the use of the spacer block tool (SBT) to determine JL more accurately for less experienced RTKA surgeons. To perform more precise restoration of JL, an SBT with markers was developed and produced using computer software and three-dimensional printers. The study was planned prospectively to include patients who received either condylar constrained or rotating hinge RTKA between January 2016 and December 2019. To determine JL, distance from fibular head (FH), adductor tubercle (AT), and medial epicondyle (ME) were measured on contralateral knee preoperative radiographs and on operated knee postoperative radiographs. Patients were randomized and grouped according to the technique of JL reconstruction. In Group 1, conventional methods by evaluating aforementioned landmarks and preoperative contralateral knee measurements were used to determine JL, whereas in Group 2, the SBT was used. The main outcome measure was the JL change in revised knee postoperatively in contrast to contralateral knee to compare effective restoration of JL between the groups. Twenty-five patients in Group 1 (3 males, 22 females, 72 years, body mass index [BMI] 32.04 +/- 4.45) and 20 patients (7 males, 13 females, 74 years, BMI 30.12 +/- 5.02) in Group 2 were included in the study. JL measurements for the whole group were FH-JL = 18.3 +/- 3.8 mm, AT-JL = 45.8 +/- 4.6 mm, and ME-JL = 27.1 +/- 2.8 mm preoperatively, and FH-JL = 20.7 +/- 4.2 mm, AT-JL = 43.4 +/- 5.2 mm, and ME-JL = 24.7 +/- 3.1 mm postoperatively. JL level differences in reference to FH, AT, and ME in Group 1 were 3.6 +/- 3.1, 3.6 +/- 3.5, and 3.4 +/- 3.1 mm, respectively, and in Group 2 were 1.0 +/- .0.9, 1.3 +/- 1.3, and 1.1 +/- 1.3 mm, respectively. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups in JL changes referenced to all of the specific landmarks (p < 0.05). The use of the SBT helped restore JL effectively in our cohort of RTKA patients. Therefore, this tool may become a useful and inexpensive gadget for less experienced and low-volume RTKA surgeons."]}
{"question": "Does the type of tibial component affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: There are a number of factors responsible for the longevity of unicompartmental knee replacements (UKR). These include the magnitude of postoperative alignment and the type of material used. The effect of component design and material on postoperative alignment, however, has not been explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients who underwent UKR with robotic guidance. Patients were divided into two groups, according to whether they had received an all-polyethylene inlay component (Inlay group) or a metal-backed onlay component (Onlay group). We explored the magnitude of mechanical alignment correction obtained in both groups. RESULTS: Mean postoperative mechanical alignment was significantly closer to neutral in the Onlay group (mean=2.8 degrees ; 95% CI=2.4 degrees , 3.2 degrees ) compared to the Inlay group (mean=3.9 degrees ; 95% CI=3.4 degrees , 4.4 degrees ) (R2=0.65; P=0.003), adjusting for gender, BMI, age, side and preoperative mechanical alignment (Fig. 2). Further exploration revealed that the thickness of the tibial polyethyelene insert had a significant effect on postoperative alignment when added to the model (R2=0.68; P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients who received a metal-backed Onlay tibial component obtained better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received all-polyethylene Inlay prostheses. The thicker overall construct of Onlay prostheses appears to be an important determinant of postoperative alignment. Considering their higher survivorship rates and improved postoperative mechanical alignment, Onlay prostheses should be the first option when performing medial UKR.", "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a very successful procedure, but pain or difficulties during activities still persist in patients. Patient outcomes in TKA surgery can be affected by implant design, alignment or patient-related anatomical factors. This paper presents a numerical sensitivity analysis of several TKA types: a fixed bearing, posterior stabilized prosthesis, a high flexion fixed bearing guided motion prosthesis, a mobile bearing prosthesis and a hinge prosthesis. Each prosthesis was virtually implanted on the same cadaver leg model and it underwent a loaded squat, in 10s, between 0 degrees  and 120 degrees , similar to several previous experimental tests performed on knee kinematics simulators. The aim of this examination was to investigate the sensitivity of the patello-femoral (PF) and tibio-femoral (TF) contact forces to patient-related anatomical factors, and component position in the different implant types. The following parameters were used for the sensitivity study: the proximo-distal patellar position, the patellar component tilting, the tibial component position and orientation, the locations of the medial and lateral collateral ligaments with respect to femur and tibia and the patellar tendon length. The sensitivity analysis showed that PF contact forces are mostly affected by patella height (increases up to 67% for one TKA type in patella-alta configuration), by an anterior tibial component translation (increases up to 30%), and by patellar component tilting (increases up to 29%); TF contact forces are mostly affected by the anterior displacement of the insertion points of the medial collateral ligament with respect to the reference position (increases up to 48%).", "Wear of the insert backside occurs ostensibly because of micromotion at the undersurface articulation that occurs with loading. When a cyclic axial load was applied to contemporary knee implants, all inserts tested moved 2 to 25 microm in the shear plane relative to the metal backing suggesting that undersurface motion may be inevitable. Variables that increase the forces between the insert and metal backing can worsen relative micromotion and backside wear. Forces at the undersurface articulation, created during physiologic loading, are influenced by insert type, articular design, and surgical technique. Increasing articular insert constraint can cause forces at the main articulation to be resisted and transferred to this and the other interfaces. Designs with a cam post mechanism that force rollback at a certain flexion angle create a significant force in this shear plane. Inserts with highly conforming articular geometries can have a similar affect if used to inhibit anteroposterior or mediolateral motion of the femur on the tibial insert. Component alignment and position, and ligament balance also may influence backside wear as suggested by the great variability of wear patterns seen on like insert retrievals and by kinematic differences observed in fluoroscopic studies of the same implant design. Only by understanding these potential causes of backside motion and subsequent wear, can backside wear be mitigated."]}

{"question": "Does the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth predict risk in a subsequent pregnancy?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether risk of recurrent preterm birth differs based on the clinical presentation of a prior spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB): advanced cervical dilatation (ACD), preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), or preterm labor (PTL). STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included singleton pregnancies from 2009 to 2014 complicated by a history of prior SPTB. Women were categorized based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm delivery as having ACD, PPROM, or PTL. Risks for sonographic short cervical length and recurrent SPTB were compared between women based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm birth. Log-linear regression was used to control for confounders. RESULTS: Of 522 patients included in this study, 96 (18.4%) had prior ACD, 246 (47.1%) had prior PPROM, and 180 (34.5%) had prior PTL. Recurrent PTB occurred in 55.2% of patients with a history of ACD compared with 27.2% of those with PPROM and 32.2% with PTL (P = .001). The mean gestational age at delivery was significantly lower for those with a history of ACD (34.0 weeks) compared with women with prior PPROM (37.2 weeks) or PTL (37.0 weeks) (P = .001). The lowest mean cervical length prior to 24 weeks was significantly shorter in patients with a history of advanced cervical dilation when compared with the other clinical presentations. CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.", "Obstetrical complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia or preterm birth occur in approx. 15% of human pregnancies. Clinical experts often state that a previous uncomplicated pregnancy reduces the risk for complications in subsequent pregnancies. Vice versa, a prior pregnancy affected by obstetrical complications increases the risk for reoccurrence. However, published evidence directly underpinning these clinical statements is sparse. Considering that the maternal immune adaptation may be causally involved in determining the outcome of subsequent pregnancies, a comprehensive analysis of clinical data was long overdue. We here present a systematic analysis of clinical data using a PubMed-based approach to identify human studies with relevant information on birth weight and incidences of pregnancy complications in first and second pregnancies. From initially 18,592 publications, 37 studies were included in the quantitative data analysis. Women with a previous pregnancy affected by complications where a derailed immune response can be inferred have a 2.2-3.2-fold increased risk to be affected again in a subsequent pregnancy. Conversely, a normally progressing primary pregnancy reduced the risk for complications in a subsequent pregnancy by 35-65%. Moreover, an uncomplicated primary pregnancy was associated with a 4.2% increased birth weight in a following pregnancy without a difference in gestational age at delivery. In conclusion, the increased birth weight after previously uncomplicated pregnancies suggests that an immune memory is mounted during primary pregnancies. This immune memory may promote the successful outcome of subsequent pregnancies or - if missing or compromised - account for a risk perpetuation of pregnancy complications.", "OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the association between spontaneous abortion and subsequent adverse birth outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Washington State birth certificate records for 1984 to 1987 were used to examine the association between spontaneous abortion and adverse outcomes in the subsequent live birth. Adverse birth outcomes were examined for women with one spontaneous abortion before the index pregnancy (n = 2146) and for women with three or more prior spontaneous abortions and no other prior pregnancies (n = 638); compared with women with no prior spontaneous abortions (n = 3099). Logistic regression was used to estimate the relative risk associated with prior spontaneous abortion of each adverse outcome. RESULTS: Women with three or more prior spontaneous abortions were at higher risk for delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation (relative risk 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.1), placenta previa (relative risk 6.0, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 22.2), having membranes ruptured greater than 24 hours (relative risk 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.9), breech presentation (relative risk 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 3.6), and having an infant with a congenital malformation (relative risk 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 3.0). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that common causes may underlie recurrent spontaneous abortion and certain adverse birth outcomes. They may also help guide clinical management of pregnancies in women with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortions.", "Introduction  The United States ranks 27th among nations worldwide for infant mortality with a rate of 6.1 deaths per 1,000 live births. The majority of perinatal morbidity and mortality is related to preterm birth, defined as delivery prior to 37 weeks' gestation. Among the risk factors for preterm birth is prior preterm birth, which is associated with a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase in risk. At the present time, there is only one Food and Drug Administration approved treatment for the prevention of preterm birth among women with a history of prior spontaneous premature delivery, intramuscular 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHP), administered once weekly from 20 to 36 weeks' gestation. However, many eligible pregnant patients decline this therapy. Methods  This was a prospective, cohort study involving patients who were identified as candidates for 17-OHP treatment at their first obstetric visit and asked to complete a short survey regarding their history of preterm birth. Those patients who consented to a follow-up phone call were asked to participate in a focus group discussion regarding their experience with progesterone and the health care system. Results  During the 1-year study period, 55 progesterone candidates were identified, 43 accepted treatment, 7 refused, and 5 either initiated prenatal care too late to receive injections or did not follow-up. Those who accepted treatment appeared to cope better with treatment side effects, and/or had traumatic emotional reactions regarding their prior premature birth outcomes. Women who declined treatment often cited pain with injection, had fatalistic beliefs regarding their care, and/or had personal concerns related to full-term pregnancy. Discussion  Maternal health care providers should always discuss the implications of prematurity at the time of the index premature delivery and again at the first prenatal visit of the subsequent pregnancy. Providers need to be prepared to employ various techniques for patient counseling and education. Small changes in office practice, like having fewer care providers involved in patient care or providing distractions for children, may make the difference between a patient who is open or closed to treatment options.", "BACKGROUND: Little is known about the risk of non-recurrent adverse birth outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk of stillbirth, preterm birth (PTB), and small for gestational age (SGA) as a proxy for fetal growth restriction (FGR) following exposure to one or more of these factors in a previous birth. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Maternity and Infant Care, and Global Health from inception to 30 November 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were included if they investigated the association between stillbirth, PTB, or SGA (as a proxy for FGR) in two subsequent births. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Meta-analysis and pooled association presented as odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted odds ratios (aORs). MAIN RESULTS: Of the 3399 studies identified, 17 met the inclusion criteria. A PTB or SGA (as a proxy for FGR) infant increased the risk of subsequent stillbirth ((pooled OR 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 1.34-2.16) and (pooled OR 1.98; 95% CI 1.70-2.31), respectively). A combination of exposures, such as a preterm SGA (as a proxy for FGR) birth, doubled the risk of subsequent stillbirth (pooled OR 4.47; 95% CI 2.58-7.76). The risk of stillbirth also varied with prematurity, increasing three-fold following PTB <34 weeks of gestation (pooled OR 2.98; 95% CI 2.05-4.34) and six-fold following preterm SGA (as a proxy for FGR) <34 weeks of gestation (pooled OR 6.00; 95% CI 3.43-10.49). A previous stillbirth increased the risk of PTB (pooled OR 2.82; 95% CI 2.31-3.45), and subsequent SGA (as a proxy for FGR) (pooled OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.10-1.76). CONCLUSION: The risk of stillbirth, PTB, or SGA (as a proxy for FGR) was moderately elevated in women who previously experienced a single exposure, but increased between two- and three-fold when two prior adverse outcomes were combined. Clinical guidelines should consider the inter-relationship of stillbirth, PTB, and SGA, and that each condition is an independent risk factor for the other conditions. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Risk of adverse birth outcomes in next pregnancy increases with the combined number of previous adverse events. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Why and how was the study carried out? Each year, around 2.6 million babies are stillborn, 15 million are born preterm (<37 weeks of gestation), and 32 million are born small for gestational age (less than tenth percentile for weight, smaller than usually expected for the relevant pregnancy stage). Being born preterm or small for gestational age can increase the chance of long-term health problems. The effect of having a stillbirth, preterm birth, or small-for-gestational-age infant in a previous pregnancy on future pregnancy health has not been summarised. We identified 3399 studies of outcomes of previous pregnancies, and 17 were summarised by our study. What were the main findings? The outcome of the previous pregnancy influenced the risk of poor outcomes in the next pregnancy. Babies born to mothers who had a previous preterm birth or small-for-gestational-age birth were more likely to be stillborn. The smaller and the more preterm the previous baby, the higher the risk of stillbirth in the following pregnancy. The risk of stillbirth in the following pregnancy was doubled if the previous baby was born both preterm and small for gestational age. Babies born to mothers who had a previous stillbirth were more likely to be preterm or small for gestational age. What are the limitations of the work? We included a small number of studies, as there are not enough studies in this area (adverse birth outcomes followed by adverse cross outcomes in the next pregnancy). We found very few studies that compared the risk of small for gestational age after preterm birth or stillbirth. Definitions of stillbirth, preterm birth categories, and small for gestational age differed across studies. We did not know the cause of stillbirth for most studies. What are the implications for patients? Women who have a history of poor pregnancy outcomes are at greater risk of poor outcomes in following pregnancies. Health providers should be aware of this risk when treating patients with a history of poor pregnancy outcomes."]}
{"question": "Is the Distance Worth It?", "retrieved_passages": ["Decision making is one of the principal cognitive processes underlying goal-directed behaviour and thus there is justifiably strong interest in modeling it. However, many of these models have yet to be tested outside of the laboratory. At the same time, field work would benefit from the use of experimental methods developed in the laboratory to determine the causal relationships between environmental variables and behaviour. We therefore adapted a laboratory-derived experimental paradigm to test decision making in the wild. The experiment used an indifference-point procedure to determine the influence of both the amount and distance of food on choice behaviour. Free-ranging rhesus monkeys were given the choice between a smaller amount of food at a closer distance and a larger amount farther away. In four conditions, we held the closer amount constant across trials and varied the farther amount to determine the point at which the monkeys were indifferent to the choice alternatives. For example, in condition one, we used one piece of food at the closer location, and determined how many pieces would be equivalent in the farther location. Four different closer amounts were tested to obtain an indifference point curve, with the indifference amounts at the farther location plotted against the closer amounts. The slope of the obtained linear indifference curve was surprisingly high, suggesting that rhesus monkeys significantly discount food that is farther away. Possible reasons for this steep spatial discounting are discussed.", "BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether traveling long distances to high-volume centers would compensate for travel burden among patients undergoing rectal cancer resection. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether operative volume outweighs the advantages of being treated locally by comparing the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer treated at local, low-volume centers versus far, high-volume centers. DESIGN: This was a population-based study. SETTINGS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with rectal cancer. PATIENTS: Patients with stage II or III rectal cancer who underwent surgical resection between 2006 and 2012 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes of interest were margins, lymph node yield, receipt of neoadjuvant chemoradiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, readmission within 30 days, 30-day and 90-day mortality, and 5-year overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 18,605 patients met inclusion criteria; 2067 patients were in the long-distance/high-volume group and 1362 in the short-distance/low-volume group. The median travel distance was 62.6 miles for the long-distance/high-volume group and 2.3 miles for the short-distance/low-volume group. Patients who were younger, white, privately insured, and stage III were more likely to have traveled to a high-volume center. When controlled for patient factors, stage, and hospital factors, patients in the short-distance/low-volume group had lower odds of a lymph node yield >/=12 (OR = 0.51) and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (OR = 0.67) and higher 30-day (OR = 3.38) and 90-day mortality (OR = 2.07) compared with those in the long-distance/high-volume group. The short-distance/low-volume group had a 34% high risk of overall mortality at 5 years compared with the long-distance/high-volume group. LIMITATIONS: We lacked data regarding patient and physician decision making and surgeon-specific factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that when controlled for patient, tumor, and hospital factors, patients who traveled a long distance to a high-volume center had improved lymph node yield, neoadjuvant chemoradiation receipt, and 30- and 90-day mortality compared with those who traveled a short distance to a low-volume center. They also had improved 5-year survival. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A446.", "BACKGROUND: Centralized care for patients with pancreatic cancer is associated with longer survival. We hypothesized that increased travel distance from home is associated with increased survival for pancreatic cancer patients. METHODS: The National Cancer Database user file for all pancreatic cancer patients was investigated from 2004 through 2015. Distance from the patients' zip code to the treating facility was determined. Survival was investigated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox hazard ratios (CoxHRs) were determined based on stage of disease, distance traveled for care, and clinical factors. RESULTS: 340 780 patients were identified. In the average age of 68 +/- 12 years, 51% were male and 83% were Caucasian. For all stages of cancer, longer survival was associated with traveling farther (P < .001). The survival advantage was longer for Caucasians than African Americans (3.7 months vs. 2.6 months, P < .001) Travel was associated with a 13% decrease in risk of death (P < .001). Even controlling for the pathologic stage, traveling farther was associated with decreased risk of death (CoxHR = .91, P < .001). DISCUSSION: Traveling for care is associated with improved survival for pancreatic cancer patients. While a selection bias may exist, the fact that all stages of patients investigated benefited suggests that this is a real phenomenon.", "BACKGROUND: Regionalization of sarcoma care may improve outcomes. Concerns exist regarding the burdens of travel and its effects on care. We evaluate the presence of a \"distance bias\". METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients with extremity soft tissue sarcoma (stage I-III) within the NCDB. Travel distance (TD) and hospital volume (VOL) were categorized into quartiles. Alternating statistical models were used for analysis. RESULTS: 1,035 hospitals contributed 11,979 cases. Median and maximum VOL were 5 and 45 cases/year. VOL quartiles were \"low-volume\" (LV) (892 hospitals, < 3 cases/yr.), \"intermediate low-volume\" (ILV) (89, 3-5 cases/yr.), \"intermediate high-volume\" (IHV) (39, 6-12 cases/yr.), and \"high-volume\" (HV) (15, > 12 cases/yr.). TD quartiles: \"short-travel\" (ST) (< 8 mi), \"intermediate-short travel\" (IST) (8-17), \"intermediate long-travel\" (ILT) (18-49), and \"long-travel\" (LT) (> 50). VOL but not TD is associated with improved survival [HR 0.65 (CI 0.52-0.83)] and rate of R0 resection [1.87 (CI 1.4-2.5)] but has no effect on amputation rates. Matched analyses demonstrate similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital volume but not distance traveled to treatment facility is associated with improved survival and R0 resections for extremity soft tissue sarcomas. Despite the inconveniences of travel, patients may benefit from treatment at high volume centers.", "OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy is a core oncologic treatment, but literature detailing patient satisfaction post-treatment is sparse. The authors conducted a pilot study to determine whether a simple survey would be feasible to administer and could elucidate factors predictive of satisfaction with radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with cancer receiving radiotherapy in an academic radiation oncology department from 2014 to 2015 received a 4-item radiotherapy-focused version of the \"Was It Worth It?\" questionnaire (r-WIWI) on the last day of treatment and at the first follow-up. Univariate analysis and logistic regression modeling were performed on collected patient and treatment characteristics to explore predictors of satisfaction. RESULTS: Two hundred patients completed an r-WIWI questionnaire at treatment completion and 60 at the time of the first follow-up. Seventy-one percent and 90% of patients found radiotherapy worthwhile on the last day of treatment and at first follow-up, respectively. Patients treated during the morning and for a longer duration as measured in elapsed days were more likely to report treatment being worthwhile. Age, sex, race, marital status, employment status, treatment intent or modalities, daily radiation treatment delays, distance traveled, insurance type, site of treatment, and cancer stage were not predictive of patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: The r-WIWI survey was feasible to administer and most patients reported treatment being worthwhile on the last day of treatment and at first follow-up. Morning treatment times and longer treatment duration as measured in elapsed days were predictive of higher satisfaction in this pilot study. A broader study of factors associated with patient satisfaction with radiotherapy using the r-WIWI is indicated."]}
{"question": "Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that approaching a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.", "OBJECTIVE: Perinatal testicular torsion (PTT) is a rare event with controversies surrounding its etiology, prebsentation, surgical management and sequelae. Our survey assessed the preferences of pediatric urologists with regard to its management. METHODS: Four cases of unilateral PTT and a questionnaire containing 11 questions about management of common clinical scenarios were mailed to 26 pediatric urologists. The answers were received anonymously and they were analyzed blindly. RESULTS: The response rate was 80% (21/26), with 90% (19/21) of respondents holding academic appointments. In the 2 first cases of PTT with a typical unilateral nonviable testis, 76% (16/21) and 67% (14/21), respectively, opted for surgery. A case of acute postnatal torsion resulted in 100% agreement to urgent scrotal exploration. In the case of an atrophic testis, none of the respondents opted for immediate surgery; yet, 38% (8/21) said they would proceed with a delayed orchiopexy of the contralateral testicle. In the question section, 10% (2/21) responded that they preferred to explore PTT immediately; whereas, 57% (12/21) would delay surgical exploration for a few days until the neonate was better stabilized. One-third of participants (7/21) would not perform a surgical exploration but would just follow the child clinically. A scrotal incision for contralateral orchiopexy was preferred by 52% (11/21), while 48% (10/21) prefer a scrotal approach but would switch to an inguinal incision if a hydrocele were present. Operative intervention was favoured by 80% (8/10) and 46% (5/11) of those with less than and greater than 10 years of practice, respectively. CONCLUSION: This survey revealed that 67% (14/21) of respondents preferred immediate exploration of a torted testis and contralateral orchiopexy, compared with the nonoperative approach. Scrotal incision for the exploration was preferred by most respondents. There was a trend to choose less aggressive treatment as the years of practice increase. Studies of more robust design, such as randomized controlled trials, are necessary to determine the natural history and outcomes of this uncommon type of testicular torsion."]}
{"question": "Is it Crohn's disease?", "retrieved_passages": ["Background: Sulfasalazine is a widely used anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and several rheumatological disorders. Although as many as 20% of treated patients may experience reversible, dose-dependent side effects, less frequent but potentially severe, systemic reactions have also been reported.  Case presentation: A severe systemic reaction to sulfasalazine developed in a 21-year old female with rheumatoid arthritis characterized by eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis and myelotoxicity, cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures. The clinical course and management of this patient are presented as well as a review of the incidence and outcome of severe systemic reactions to sulfasalazine. Conclusions: Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology associated with an impaired immune response, with periods of activity and remission. It is characterised by patchy and transmural lesions which can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus. The most frequent symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhoea, which can seriously affect patients' quality of life. The increasing incidence and prevalence of the disease in our area has had a large impact on clinical practice, with the rapid development of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. To reduce the risk of complications, primary care physicians and gastroenterologists should be familiar with the management of the disease.", "Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the gastrointestinal tract. It can cause lesions from mouth to anus and may result in extraintestinal complications. The prevalence of Crohn's disease is increasing in adults and children. Genetic predispositions to Crohn's disease have been identified, and specific environmental factors have been associated with its development. Common presenting symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Physical examination should identify unstable patients requiring immediate care, include an anorectal examination, and look for extraintestinal complications. Initial laboratory evaluation identifies inflammation and screens for alternative diagnoses. Measurement of fecal calprotectin has value to rule out disease in adults and children. Endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging are used to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of disease. Treatment decisions are guided by disease severity and risk of poor outcomes. Patients commonly receive corticosteroids to treat symptom flare-ups. Patients with higher-risk disease are given biologics, with or without immunomodulators, to induce and maintain remission. For children, enteral nutrition is an option for induction therapy. All patients with Crohn's disease should be counseled on smoking avoidance or cessation. Patients with Crohn's disease are at increased risk of cancer, osteoporosis, anemia, nutritional deficiencies, depression, infection, and thrombotic events. Maximizing prevention measures is essential in caring for these patients.", "Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease process involving different sites in the gastrointestinal tract. Occasionally, so-called metastatic disease occurs in extra-intestinal sites. Granulomatous inflammation may be detected in endoscopic biopsies or resected tissues. Genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors appear to play a role. Multiple susceptibility genes have been described in both familial and non-familial forms while the disease is phenotypically heterogeneous with a female predominance. The disorder occurs over a broad age spectrum, from early childhood to late adulthood. More than 80% are diagnosed before age 40 years usually with terminal ileal and colonic involvement. Pediatric-onset disease is more severe and more extensive, usually with a higher chance of upper gastrointestinal tract disease, compared to adult-onset disease. Long-term studies have shown that the disorder may evolve with time into more complex disease with stricture formation and penetrating disease complications (i.e., fistula, abscess). Although prolonged remission may occur, discrete periods of symptomatic disease may re-appear over many decades suggesting recurrence or re-activation of this inflammatory process. Eventual development of a cure will likely depend on identification of an etiologic cause and a fundamental understanding of its pathogenesis. Until now, treatment has focused on removing risk factors, particularly cigarette smoking, and improving symptoms. In clinical trials, clinical remission is largely defined as improved numerical and endoscopic indices for \"mucosal healing\". \"Deep remission\" is a conceptual, more \"extended\" goal that may or may not alter the long-term natural history of the disease in selected patients, albeit at a significant risk for treatment complications, including serious and unusual opportunistic infections.", "The following excerpt is from the Understanding Crohn's Disease course available on the ANMF's Body Systems Training Room.

This excerpt gives you 30 minutes of CPD toward your annual requirements.", "Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, with increasing incidence worldwide. Crohn's disease might result from a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and altered gut microbiota, leading to dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses. The typical clinical scenario is a young patient presenting with abdominal pain, chronic diarrhoea, weight loss, and fatigue. Assessment of disease extent and of prognostic factors for complications is paramount to guide therapeutic decisions. Current strategies aim for deep and long-lasting remission, with the goal of preventing complications, such as surgery, and blocking disease progression. Central to these strategies is the introduction of early immunosuppression or combination therapy with biologicals in high-risk patients, combined with a tight and frequent control of inflammation, and adjustment of therapy on the basis of that assessment (treat to target strategy). The therapeutic armamentarium for Crohn's disease is expanding, and therefore the need to develop biomarkers that can predict response to therapies will become increasingly important for personalised medicine decisions in the near future. In this Seminar, we provide a physician-oriented overview of Crohn's disease in adults, ranging from epidemiology and cause to clinical diagnosis, natural history, patient stratification and clinical management, and ending with an overview of emerging therapies and future directions for research."]}
{"question": "Does multi-modal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Tinnitus can be related to many different aetiologies such as hearing loss or a noise trauma, but it can also be related to the somatosensory system of the cervical spine, called cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). Case studies suggest a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST, but no experimental studies are available. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS: Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI): 25-90 points) and neck complaints (Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ) > 14 points). INTERVENTION: All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n = 19) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n = 19). MEASUREMENTS: TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline. RESULTS: In all patients (n = 38) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p = 0.04 and p < 0.001). NBQ-scores remained significantly lower after follow-up (p = 0.001). Immediately after treatment, 53% (n = 38) experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus. This effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up at six weeks. CONCLUSION: Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02016313."]}
{"question": "Detailed analysis of sputum and systemic inflammation in asthma phenotypes: are paucigranulocytic asthmatics really non-inflammatory?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The technique of induced sputum has allowed to subdivide asthma patients into inflammatory phenotypes according to their level of granulocyte airway infiltration. There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes. RESULTS: The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p < 0.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005), with paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Neutrophilic asthma had raised CRP and fibrinogen while eosinophilic asthma only showed raised fibrinogen compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a significant eosinophilic inflammation is present across all categories of asthma, and that paucigranulocytic asthma may be seen as a low grade inflammatory disease."]}
{"question": "Can increases in the cigarette tax rate be linked to cigarette retail prices?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To explain China's cigarette pricing mechanism and the role of the Chinese State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) on cigarette pricing and taxation. METHODS: Published government tobacco tax documentation and statistics published by the Chinese STMA are used to analyse the interrelations among industry profits, taxes and retail price of cigarettes in China. RESULTS: The 2009 excise tax increase on cigarettes in China has not translated into higher retail prices because the Chinese STMA used its policy authority to ensure that retail cigarette prices did not change. The government tax increase is being collected at both the producer and wholesale levels. As a result, the 2009 excise tax increase in China has resulted in higher tax revenue for the government and lower profits for the tobacco industry, with no increase in the retail price of cigarettes for consumers. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous studies have found that taxation is one of the most effective policy instruments for tobacco control. However, these findings come from countries that have market economies where market forces determine prices and influence how cigarette taxes are passed to the consumers in retail prices. China's tobacco industry is not a market economy; therefore, non-market forces and the current Chinese tobacco monopoly system determine cigarette prices. The result is that tax increases do not necessarily get passed on to the retail price."]}
{"question": "Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: We observed an endoscopic abnormally in a group of children with histological esophagitis. We termed this finding \"vertical lines in esophageal mucosa\" (VLEM). We examined the relationship between the presence of VLEM and significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies. METHODS: Between January 1, 1992, and August 31, 1994, the senior author (JFF) performed 255 esophageal biopsies. The procedure reports, available endoscopic photographs, and histology reports were reviewed to establish the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Intraepithelial cells were counted in a blind review of 42 randomly selected biopsies. RESULTS: The esophageal mucosa had a normal appearance on 160 endoscopic studies (Group 1) and VLEM were the only mucosal abnormalities in 41 endoscopies (Group 2). Histology was normal in 92 of 160 biopsies (57.5%) from Group 1, and 1 of 41 biopsies (2.4%) from Group 2. Most patients in Group 2 had eosinophilic esophagitis (34 of 41, 83%, specificity 0.85, sensitivity 0.5, p > 0.001) which was of moderate to severe intensity (31 of 34, 91.2%, specificity 0.88, sensitivity 0.73, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children."]}
{"question": "Does the radiographic transition zone correlate with the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: The correlation between radiographic transition zone on contrast enema in Hirschsprung's disease and the total length of aganglionosis is known to be inaccurate. The aim of our study was to analyse this correlation more precisely to improve preoperative planning of the corrective surgery. METHODS: From 1998 to 2009, 79 patients were operated on for Hirschsprung's disease. All available preoperative contrast enemas (n = 61) had been single blind reviewed by the same radiologist who defined the radiographic transition zone when present in vertebral level. Four groups were determined (rectal, rectosigmoid, long segment, and absence of transition zone) and by Kappa coefficient of agreement correlated to the length of aganglionosis in the pathological report. RESULTS: Radiological findings were concordant with the specimen in pathology in 8 cases of 19 in rectal form (42 %), in 20 cases of 35 in rectosigmoid form (57 %), in all 6 cases of long-segment form (100 %), in the 2 cases of total colonic form (100 %) with a global agreement of 58.1 %, kappa = 0.39 CI [0.24; 0.57]. CONCLUSION: Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low.

{"question": "Do Electrochemiluminescence Assays Improve Prediction of Time to Type 1 Diabetes in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet Subjects?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To explore whether electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can help improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet autoantibody-positive population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: TrialNet subjects who were positive for one or more autoantibodies (microinsulin autoantibody, GAD65 autoantibody [GADA], IA-2A, and ZnT8A) with available ECL-insulin autoantibody (IAA) and ECL-GADA data at their initial visit were analyzed; after a median follow-up of 24 months, 177 of these 1,287 subjects developed diabetes. RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed that autoantibodies by radioimmunoassays (RIAs), ECL-IAA, ECL-GADA, age, sex, number of positive autoantibodies, presence of HLA DR3/4-DQ8 genotype, HbA1c, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measurements were all significantly associated with progression to diabetes. Subjects who were ECL positive had a risk of progression to diabetes within 6 years of 58% compared with 5% for the ECL-negative subjects (P < 0.0001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were compared, with the base model including age, sex, OGTT measurements, and number of positive autoantibodies by RIAs. The model with positivity for ECL-GADA and/or ECL-IAA was the best, and factors that remained significantly associated with time to diabetes were area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide, fasting C-peptide, AUC glucose, number of positive autoantibodies by RIAs, and ECL positivity. Adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) improved the receiver operating characteristic curves with AUC of 0.83 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future."]}
{"question": "Assessment of appropriate antimicrobial prescribing: do experts agree?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the validity and reliability of expert assessments of the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, despite their importance in antimicrobial stewardship. We investigated how infectious disease doctors' assessments compared with a reference standard (modal expert opinion) and with the assessments of their colleagues. METHODS: Twenty-four doctors specialized in infectious diseases or clinical microbiology (16 specialists and 8 residents) from five hospitals were asked to assess the appropriateness of antimicrobial agents prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications in 56 paper cases. They were instructed how to handle guideline applicability and deviations. We created a reference standard of antimicrobial appropriateness using the modal assessment of 16 specialists. We calculated criterion validity and interrater and intrarater overall and specific agreement with an index expert (senior infectious disease physician) and analysed the influence of doctor characteristics on validity. RESULTS: Specialists agreed with the reference standard in 80% of cases (range 75%-86%), with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 84%, respectively. This did not differ by clinical specialty, hospital or years of experience, and residents had similar results. Specialists agreed with the index expert in 76% of cases and the index expert agreed with his previous assessments in 71% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors specialized in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology assess the appropriateness of antimicrobials prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications with acceptable agreement and validity, regardless of their experience or hospital of employment. However, there is room for improvement, which merits attention in multidisciplinary discussions and education.", "Background In 2007, ESAC (http://www.esac.ua.ac.be) published a set of 12 valid drug-specific quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic use in Europe. In this study, the authors aimed to develop evidence-based disease-specific quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic prescribing in Europe. Methods Two meetings were convened to produce a list of disease-specific quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic prescribing which conform to internationally agreed recommendations, building on a similar development of drug-specific quality indicators, and in collaboration with CHAMP and HAPPY AUDIT. 62 experts were asked to complete two scoring rounds of the proposed indicators on seven dimensions: their relevance to (1) reducing antimicrobial resistance, (2) patient health benefit, (3) cost-effectiveness, (4) policy makers, (5) individual prescribers, (6) their evidence base and (7) their range of acceptable use, using a scale ranging from 1 (=completely disagree) to 9 (=completely agree). Scores were judged according to the UCLA-RAND appropriateness method. Results For the six main indications for antibiotic prescribing (acute otitis media, acute upper-respiratory infection, acute/chronic sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis, cystitis/other urinary infection) and for pneumonia, three quality indicators were proposed, the percentage prescribed (a) antibiotics; (b) recommended antibiotics; (c) quinolones. This set was scored by 40 experts from 25 countries. After one scoring round, all indicators were already rated as relevant on all dimensions, except one. Conclusion All proposed disease-specific quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic prescribing have face validity and are potentially applicable. They could be used to better describe antibiotic use and assess the quality of antibiotic prescribing patterns in ambulatory care.", "This study developed a patient-level audit tool to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in acute National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK. A modified Delphi process was used to evaluate variables identified from published literature that could be used to support an assessment of appropriateness of antibiotic use. At a national workshop, 22 infection experts reached a consensus to define appropriate prescribing and agree upon an initial draft audit tool. Following this, a national multidisciplinary panel of 19 infection experts, of whom only one was part of the workshop, was convened to evaluate and validate variables using questionnaires to confirm the relevance of each variable in assessing appropriate prescribing. The initial evidence synthesis of published literature identified 25 variables that could be used to support an assessment of appropriateness of antibiotic use. All the panel members reviewed the variables for the first round of the Delphi; the panel accepted 23 out of 25 variables. Following review by the project team, one of the two rejected variables was rephrased, and the second neutral variable was re-scored. The panel accepted both these variables in round two with a 68% response rate. Accepted variables were used to develop an audit tool to determine the extent of appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing at the individual patient level in acute NHS hospitals through infection expert consensus based on the results of a Delphi process.", "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Indicators to measure the quality of healthcare are increasingly used by healthcare professionals and policy makers. In the context of increasing antimicrobial resistance, this study aimed to develop valid drug-specific quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic use in Europe, derived from European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) data. METHODS: 27 experts (15 countries), in a European Science Foundation workshop, built on the expertise within the European Drug Utilisation Research Group, the General Practice Respiratory Infections Network, the ESCMID Study Group on Primary Care Topics, the Belgian Antibiotic Policy Coordination Committee, the World Health Organization, ESAC, and other experts. A set of proposed indicators was developed using 1997-2003 ESAC data. Participants scored the relevance of each indicator to reducing antimicrobial resistance, patient health benefit, cost effectiveness and public health policy makers (scale: 1 (completely disagree) to 9 (completely agree)). The scores were processed according to the UCLA-RAND appropriateness method. Indicators were judged relevant if the median score was not in the 1-6 interval and if there was consensus (number of scores within the 1-3 interval was fewer than one third of the panel). From the relevant indicators providing overlapping information, the one with the highest scores was selected for the final set of quality indicators-values were updated with 2004 ESAC data. RESULTS: 22 participants (12 countries) completed scoring of a set of 22 proposed indicators. Nine were rated as relevant antibiotic prescribing indicators on all four dimensions; five were rated as relevant if only relevance to reducing antimicrobial resistance and public health policy makers was taken into account. A final set of 12 indicators was selected. CONCLUSION: 12 of the proposed ESAC-based quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic use in Europe have face validity and are potentially applicable. These indicators could be used to better describe antibiotic use in ambulatory care and assess the quality of national antibiotic prescribing patterns in Europe.", "OBJECTIVE: To provide hospital leaders with strategic goals or actions likely to have a significant impact on antimicrobial resistance, outline outcome and process measures for evaluating progress toward each goal, describe potential barriers to success, and suggest countermeasures and novel improvement strategies. PARTICIPANTS: A multidisciplinary group of experts was drawn from the following areas: hospital epidemiology and infection control, infectious diseases (including graduate training programs), clinical practice (including nursing, surgery, internal medicine, and pediatrics), pharmacy, administration, quality improvement, appropriateness evaluation, behavior modification, practice guideline development, medical informatics, and outcomes research. Representatives from appropriate federal agencies, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, and the pharmaceutical industry also participated. EVIDENCE: Published literature, guidelines, expert opinion, and practical experience regarding efforts to improve antibiotic utilization and prevent and control the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms in hospitals. CONSENSUS PROCESS: Participants were divided into two quality improvement teams: one focusing on improving antimicrobial usage and the other on preventing and controlling transmission of resistant microorganisms. The teams modeled the process a hospital might use to develop and implement a strategic plan to combat antimicrobial resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Ten strategic goals and related process and outcome measures were agreed on. The five strategic goals to optimize antimicrobial use were as follows: optimizing antimicrobial prophylaxis for operative procedures; optimizing choice and duration of empiric therapy; improving antimicrobial prescribing by educational and administrative means; monitoring and providing feedback regarding antibiotic resistance; and defining and implementing health care delivery system guidelines for important types of antimicrobial use. The five strategic goals to detect, report, and prevent transmission of antimicrobial resistant organisms were as follows: to develop a system to recognize and report trends in antimicrobial resistance within the institution; develop a system to rapidly detect and report resistant microorganisms in individual patients and ensure a rapid response by caregivers; increase adherence to basic infection control policies and procedures; incorporate the detection, prevention, and control of antimicrobial resistance into institutional strategic goals and provide the required resources; and develop a plan for identifying, transferring, discharging, and readmitting patients colonized with specific antimicrobial-resistant pathogens."]}
{"question": "Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To analyze, retrospectively, the patterns and behavior of metastatic lesions in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and to investigate whether patients with < or =5 lesions had an improved outcome relative to patients with >5 lesions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The treatment and outcome of 369 eligible patients with Stage T1-T3aN0-NXM0 prostate cancer were analyzed during a minimal 10-year follow-up period. All patients were treated with curative intent to a mean dose of 65 Gy. The full history of any metastatic disease was documented for each subject, including the initial site of involvement, any progression over time, and patient survival. RESULTS: The overall survival rate for the 369 patients was 75% at 5 years and 45% at 10 years. The overall survival rate of patients who never developed metastases was 90% and 81% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. However, among the 74 patients (20%) who developed metastases, the survival rate at both 5 and 10 years was significantly reduced (p <0.0001). The overall survival rate for patients who developed bone metastases was 58% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and patients with bone metastases to the pelvis fared worse compared with those with vertebral metastases. With regard to the metastatic number, patients with < or =5 metastatic lesions had superior survival rates relative to those with >5 lesions (73% and 36% at 5 and 10 years vs. 45% and 18% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p = 0.02). In addition, both the metastasis-free survival rate and the interval measured from the date of the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer to the development of bone metastasis were statistically superior for patients with < or =5 lesions compared with patients with >5 lesions (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). However, the survival rate and the interval from the date of diagnosis of bone metastasis to the time of death for patients in both groups were not significantly different, statistically (p = 0.17 and 0.27, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with < or =5 metastatic sites had significantly better survival rates than patients with >5 lesions. Because existing sites of metastatic disease may be the primary sites of origin for additional metastases, our findings suggest that early detection and aggressive treatment of patients with a small number of metastatic lesions is worth testing as an approach to improving long-term survival.", "PURPOSE: The Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy (STAMPEDE) trial reported overall survival benefits for prostate-directed radiation therapy (PDRT) in low-burden metastatic prostate cancer. Oligometastasis-directed radiation therapy (ORT) improves androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-free and progression-free survivals. Comprehensive PDRT + ORT to all detectable metastases may offer benefit for de novo oligometastatic prostate cancer (DNOPC) and is under prospective study; given few available benchmarks, we reviewed our institutional experience. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-seven patients with DNOPC with predominantly M1b disease received neoadjuvant, concurrent, and adjuvant ADT plus PDRT + ORT to 1 to 6 oligometastases. Gross pelvic (N1) nodes were not considered oligometastases unless focally targeted without broader nodal coverage. Outcomes were analyzed from radiation therapy (RT) start using Kaplan-Meier, competing risks, and Cox regression. Median follow-up was 27 (95% confidence interval, 16-42) months. RESULTS: At 1- and 2-years post-RT, cumulative incidence of distant metastatic progression (DMP) was 21% and 32%, whereas overall survival was 90% and 87%, respectively. Neuroendocrine/intraductal histology, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 20, and detectable PSA after PDRT + ORT were associated with increased DMP risk; number and location of oligometastases were not. Local failure was rare, with 3 prostate recurrences and progression of 10 treated oligometastases during follow-up. After neoadjuvant ADT, 9 (19%) patients had undetectable PSA (<0.05 ng/mL), which increased to 32 (68%) after PDRT + ORT. Overall 2-year incidence of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and development of castrate resistance were 23% and 36%, respectively. Undetectable PSA post-RT was associated with lower risk of BCR (hazard ratio, 0.19; P = .004) and DMP (hazard ratio, 0.26; P = .025). Overall, 23 (49%) patients were trialed off ADT; 16 (70%) had testosterone recovery (>150 ng/dL) and, of these, 5 had subsequent PSA rise and restarted ADT 2 to 21 months postrecovery. The remaining 11 were maintained off ADT without BCR. Median noncastrate duration was 8 months; 7 patients had normalized testosterone for >1 year. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive, radiotherapeutic-based treatment strategy has favorable clinical outcomes and can produce prolonged noncastrate remissions in a subset with DNOPC."]}
{"question": "Department of Transportation vs self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors: do they agree?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Research on stroke survivors' driving safety has typically used either self-reports or government records, but the extent to which the 2 may differ is not known. We compared government records and self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions in a sample of stroke survivors. METHODS: The 56 participants were originally recruited for a prospective study on driving and community re-integration post-stroke; the study population consisted of moderately impaired stroke survivors without severe communication disorders who had been referred for a driving assessment. The driving records of the 56 participants for the 5 years before study entry and the 1-year study period were acquired with written consent from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), Canada. Self-reports of collisions and convictions were acquired via a semistructured interview and then compared with the MTO records. RESULTS: Forty-three participants completed the study. For 7 (13.5%) the MTO records did not match the self-reports regarding collision involvement, and for 9 (17.3%) the MTO records did not match self-reports regarding driving convictions. The kappa coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions (both in the moderate range of agreement). When both sources of data were consulted, up to 56 percent more accidents and up to 46 percent more convictions were identified in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone. CONCLUSION: In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke."]}

MATERIAL AND METHODS: LA or locally recurrent (LR) GIST treated with NA IM from May 2008 to March 2015 from a prospective database were included in the analysis. Archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) were used for testing KIT exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 by PCR. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five patients with LA or LR GIST were treated with NA IM. Forty-five patients (36 %) had undergone c-kit mutation testing. Exon 11 was seen in 25 patients (55.5 %), 3 with exon 9 (6.7 %) and 2 with exon 13 (4.4 %). Twelve were wild type (26.6 %) and  3 (6.7 %) were declared uninterpretable. Response rate (RR) for the exon 11 mutants was higher than the non-exon 11 mutant group (84 vs. 40 %, p = 0.01). Disease stabilization rate (DSR) rates were also higher in the exon 11 subgroup than non-exon 11 group (92 vs. 75 %). Eighty-four per cent exon 11 and 75 % non-exon 11 mutants were surgical candidates. Patients undergoing surgery had significantly improved event free survival (EFS) (p < 0.001) compared to patients not undergoing surgery, with the same trend seen in OS (p = 0.021). Patients with a SD on response to NA IM had a lower EFS (p = 0.076) and OS compared to patients achieving CR/PR. There were no differences between the various exon variants in terms of outcomes and responses CONCLUSION: Upfront evaluation of kit mutation status may help us in delineating separate treatment strategies for potentially biologically different tumours and assessing the correct timing of surgery for this subset of GIST."]}
{"question": "Does the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have suggested that hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance are related to the development of colon cancer. Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up. METHODS: Our population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification. RESULTS: Development of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up. On multivariable analysis the colon cancer risk in patients who received bezafibrate tended to be lower with a hazard ratio of 0.47 and 95% confidence interval 0.2-1.1. CONCLUSION: Our data, derived from patients with coronary artery disease, support the hypothesis regarding a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer."]}
{"question": "Does self-efficacy mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviours and healthcare workers' sleep quality?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: This paper is a report of a study conducted to investigate the longitudinal relationship between transformational leadership behaviours and employees' sleep quality, and the mediating effects of self-efficacy. BACKGROUND: Although there is evidence for the influential role of transformational leadership on health outcomes, researchers have used either attitude outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction) or softer health measures, such as general well-being. Specific measures of well-being such as sleep quality have not been used, despite its association with working conditions. METHODS: A longitudinal design was used to collect data from Danish healthcare workers at time 1 in 2005 (n = 447) and 18 months later at time 2 in 2007 (n = 274). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the relationships between transformational leadership, self-efficacy and sleep quality at both time points independently (cross-sectionally) and longitudinally. RESULTS: For all constructs, time 2 measures were influenced by the baseline level. Direct relationships between transformational leadership and sleep quality were found. This relationship was negative cross-sectionally at both time points, but positive between baseline and follow-up. The relationship between leadership and employees' sleep quality was not mediated by employees' self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation."]}
{"question": "Perioperative care in an animal model for training in abdominal surgery: is it necessary a preoperative fasting?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Demonstrate that the rabbit may be used in the training of surgery, in addition to present its perioperative care. METHODS: Thirty two animals, with age and weight, respectively, from 3 to 5.5 months old and 3000 to 4200 grams, were undergone different periods of pre-operative fasting, exclusive intramuscular anesthesia (ketamine+xylazine), laparotomy with total gastrectomy and total splenectomy. It was dosed the pre-operative (initial) and post-surgical (end) serum blood glucose, in addition to quantify the gastric content after the resection of the part. RESULTS: The anesthetical-surgical procedure presented a mortality rate of 3.125% (1:32) and a morbidity rate of 6.25% (2:32). It was evidenced an initial mean blood glucose = 199.4 mg/dl and the end = 326.1 mg/dl. In spite of extended fasting (minimum of 2 hours for the absolute fasting and maximum of 8.5 hours for liquids, and 20.5 hours for solids) all animals presented at the end of the surgical procedure any gastric content and a blood glucose increase. Those with fasting for liquids and solids when compared to the quantity of solid gastric content, presented a moderate negative degree of correlation. CONCLUSION: The rabbit is a good model to be used in training of surgery, with a low morbi-mortality, able to be anesthetized intramuscularly, with no need of pre-operative fasting and does not present hypoglycemia even with the extended fasting period."]}
{"question": "Does laparoscopic surgery decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation, which occurs in 12% of all major foregut surgeries, can prolong hospital stay and increase morbidity. Minimally invasive techniques in foregut surgery have been suggested to cause less tissue trauma. We examined the factors associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery at our institution. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the records of 154 adult patients who underwent major foregut surgery which included esophagectomy, partial or total gastrectomy, redo Heller myotomy, redo or transthoracic fundoplications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis with standard modeling techniques were performed to determine risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: Of the 154 patients, 14 patients developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with a higher mean age of 67.1 years (+/-8.8 years) versus 56.4 years (+/-14.1 years) (p = 0.006). Laparoscopic (p = 0.004) and nonthoracic surgeries (p = 0.01) were associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Patients with atrial fibrillation had received more fluid (6.5 +/- 2.8 liters versus 5.3 +/- 2.0 liters) and had longer operations (370 +/- 103 min versus 362 +/- 142 min), none of which were statistically significant. The average intensive care length of stay of patients was longer: 7.5 +/- 6.8 days versus 4.0 +/- 7.1 days (p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed an association of atrial fibrillation with age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14, p = 0.01), and laparoscopic surgery (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.95, p = 0.04) after adjusting for surgery type. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery is associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation in foregut surgery. Development of atrial fibrillation is associated with increased length of intensive care stay. We recommend a prospective trial to confirm our findings."]}
{"question": "The Main Gate Syndrome: a new format in mass-casualty victim \"surge\" management?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: Recent suicide bombings pose the novel problem for Trauma Centers of the massive simultaneous arrival of many gravely wounded patients. METHODS: We report the experience of the French-German Military Trauma Group, a Level 2 Trauma Center, in Afghanistan during the wave of suicide bombings in February 2007. RESULTS: Fourteen casualties were received. A first triage was carried out by the U S Army Level I group prior to evacuation. A second surgical triage was carried out with systematic ultrasound exam. Four cases (ISS>25) were re-categorized and underwent emergency surgical procedures. CONCLUSION: Suicide bombing in crowded locations near an evacuation hospital may overwhelm the medical resources of the receiving center. It has been referred to as \"The Main Gate Syndrome.\" We introduced the novel concept of a semi-evacuation hospital or receiving center where a second surgical triage was carried out. These exceptional circumstances require open-minded flexibility, a tailored approach, and close cooperation between surgeons and anesthetists to share experience, opinions, and ideas. In the setting of mass casualties, emergency ultrasound exam was shown to be a valuable and effective tool by virtue of its mobility, reproducibility, and immediate results."]}
{"question": "Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: It is postulated that some aspects of methotrexate toxicity may be related to its action as an anti-folate. Folic acid (FA) is often given as an adjunct to methotrexate therapy, but there is no conclusive proof that it decreases the toxicity of methotrexate and there is a theoretical risk that it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate. OBJECTIVES: To look at the effect of stopping FA supplementation in UK rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients established on methotrexate <20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily, to report all toxicity (including absolute changes in haematological and liver enzyme indices) and to report changes in the efficacy of methotrexate. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 75 patients who were established on methotrexate <20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily were asked to stop their FA and were randomized to one of two groups: placebo or FA 5 mg daily. Patients were evaluated for treatment toxicity and efficacy before entry and then at intervals of 3 months for 1 yr. RESULTS: Overall, 25 (33%) patients concluded the study early, eight (21%) in the group remaining on FA and 17 (46%) in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Two patients in the placebo group discontinued because of neutropenia. At 9 months there was an increased incidence of nausea in the placebo group (45 vs. 7%, P = 0.001). The placebo group had significantly lower disease activity on a few of the variables measured, but these were probably not of clinical significance. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate."]}
{"question": "Is a patient's self-reported health-related quality of life a prognostic factor for survival in non-small-cell lung cancer patients?", "retrieved_passages": ["Background: The aim of this prognostic factor analysis was to investigate if a patient's self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) provided independent prognostic information for survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.  Patients and methods: Pretreatment HRQOL was measured in 391 advanced NSCLC patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC Lung Cancer module (QLQ-LC13). The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for both univariate and multivariate analyses of survival. In addition, a bootstrap validation technique was used to assess the stability of the outcomes.  Results: The final multivariate Cox regression model retained four parameters as independent prognostic factors for survival: male gender with a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.32 (95% CI 1.03–1.69; P = 0.03); performance status (0 to 1 versus 2) with HR = 1.63 (95% CI 1.04–2.54; P = 0.032); patient's self-reported score of pain with HR= 1.11 (95% CI 1.07–1.16; P < 0.001) and dysphagia with HR = 1.12 (95% CI 1.04–1.21; P = 0.003). A 10-point shift worse in the scale measuring pain and dysphagia translated into an 11% and 12% increased in the likelihood of death respectively. A risk group categorization was also developed. Conclusion: The results suggest that patients' self-reported HRQOL provide independent prognostic information for survival. This finding supports the collection of such data in routine clinical practice."]}
{"question": "Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): a role for polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a common cause of early respiratory distress in the neonatal period of term infants. Delayed resorption of foetal lung fluid after birth is considered as the main pathophysiological factor. As resorption of foetal lung fluid is a catecholamine dependent process, we aimed at investigating, whether beta1- and beta2-adrenoreceptor (ADRB1, ADRB2) polymorphisms, known to alter catecholamine activity, are operative in TTN. METHODS: DNA was collected for genotyping from 73 term newborns suffering from TTN and 55 healthy controls from a Caucasian cohort. RESULTS: TTN infants were more likely to be male (70% vs. 49%; p < 0.05), had a lower mean birthweight (3120 +/- 450 vs. 3396 +/- 504 g; p < 0.001) and gestational age (GA) (38.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 39.4 +/- 1.3 weeks; p < 0.001) and were more often delivered by caesarean section (CS) (71% vs. 26%; p < 0.001). The beta1Ser49Gly polymorphism differed significantly between cases and controls. Multivariate analysis provided beta1Gly49 homozygotes with higher risk for TTN (OR 18.5; 95%CI 1.5-229; p = 0.023) than beta1Ser49 allele carrier. Further analysis showed significant association of T-47C, A46G, C79G and C491T (TACC) haplotype in ADRB2 gene with TTN (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN."]}
{"question": "Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery?", "retrieved_passages": ["STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized clinical study. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether shaving the incision site before spinal surgery causes postsurgical infection. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spine surgeons usually shave the skin of the incision site immediately before surgery is performed. However, evidence from some surgical series suggests that presurgical shaving may increase the postsurgical infection rate. To our knowledge, no previously published studies have addressed this issue. METHODS: A total of 789 patients scheduled to undergo spinal surgery were randomly allocated into 2 groups: those in whom the site of operation was shaved immediately before surgery (shaved group; 371 patients) and the patients in whom presurgical shaving was not performed (unshaved group; 418 patients). The mean duration of anesthesia and the infection rates in both groups were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The duration of anesthesia did not differ in the 2 groups (P > 0.05). A postoperative infection developed in 4 patients in the shaved group and in 1 patient in the nonshaved group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection."]}
{"question": "Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To determine under what conditions lay people and health professionals find it acceptable for a physician to breach confidentiality to protect the wife of a patient with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). METHODS: In a study in France, breaching confidentiality in 48 scenarios were accepted by 144 lay people, 10 psychologists and 7 physicians. The scenarios were all possible combinations of five factors: severity of the disease (severe, lethal); time taken to discuss this with (little time, much time); intent to inform the spouse about the disease (none, one of these days, immediately); intent to adopt protective behaviours (no intent, intent); and decision to consult an expert in STDs (yes, no), 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2. The importance and interactions of each factor were determined, at the group level, by performing analyses of variance and constructing graphs. RESULTS: The concept of breaching confidentiality to protect a wife from her husband's STD was favoured much more by lay people and psychologists than by physicians (mean ratings 11.76, 9.28 and 2.90, respectively, on a scale of 0-22). The patient's stated intentions to protect his wife and to inform her of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability. A cluster analysis showed groups of lay participants who found breaching confidentiality \"always acceptable\" (n = 14), \"depending on the many circumstances\" (n = 87), requiring \"consultation with an expert\" (n = 30) and \"never acceptable (n = 13)\". CONCLUSIONS: Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD."]}
{"question": "Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant. METHODS: Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%. CONCLUSION: No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "Background: Individuals with depression have increased nonpsychiatric health care utilization. Associations between depression and utilization have not been studied in perinatal women, despite their heightened depression risk. We examined patterns of nonpsychiatric health care utilization by symptoms of perinatal depression, expecting more frequent use of acute services while being less likely to have routine medical care. Materials and Methods: We identified 1,103 perinatal participants from the 2005 to 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The Patient Health Questionnaire was used to identify depression (score >/=10). We evaluated associations between perinatal depressive symptoms and health care utilization using logistic models and relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) using adjusted models with appropriate weighting to provide national estimates. Results: Among perinatal U.S. women, 7.3% had depressive symptoms. Relative to those without these symptoms, women experiencing depressive symptoms were younger, more impoverished, and uninsured (p < 0.05). Women with depressive symptoms, compared with those without them, had twice the odds of being without routine medical care (21.6% vs. 12.5%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 4.1) and of using urgent care more frequently (26.5% vs. 15.1%, aOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0 to 3.9). Depressive symptoms combined with lack of insurance generally increased the odds of not having routine care (RERI: 8.4, 95% CI: -0.5 to 17.3) and more frequent use of urgent care (RERI: 7.1, 95% CI: -2.7 to 17.0). Conclusions: Perinatal depression is a prevalent, high-risk illness that requires more nonpsychiatric services and increased psychiatric care. Approaches that facilitate establishing a place for routine care and decreasing acute care use are necessary.", "Perinatal depression is an important indicator of mothers' mental health. Studies have been carried out to identify and characterize women at risk of such affective disorder. The aim of this study is to assess mothers' adherence to our perinatal depression screening and eventual follow-up by a multidisciplinary team, including mental health and obstetrics professionals. Ultimately, a risk profile for the uptake rate of referral was described to psychological support. Pregnant women from a maternity of a tertiary center with on-site assessment and treatment (n = 2163) were included in this study. The identification of women at risk for depression was based on a two-question screening and the EPDS scale. Demographic and obstetric data were obtained from medical records. The number of screening evaluations, the uptake referral rate and the compliance to treatment were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to predict a risk profile for adherence. Among 2163 enrolled in the protocol, 10.2% screened positive for depression. Of these, 51.8% accepted referral for mental health assistance. 74.9% were compliant to Psychology appointments and 74.1% to Psychiatry appointments. Women who had a previous history of depression were more likely to accept referral for mental health support. With this study, we were able to understand the behaviour of this population towards the screening protocol we offer. Women with a previous history of depression are more likely to accept mental health assistance.", "OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors for and the consequences (several adverse perinatal outcomes) of physician-diagnosed major depression during pregnancy treated in specialised healthcare. DESIGN: A population-based cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data were gathered from Finnish health registers for 1996-2010. PARTICIPANTS: All singleton births (n=511,938) for 2002-2010 in Finland. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence, risk factors and consequences of major depression during pregnancy. RESULTS: Among 511,938 women, 0.8% experienced major depression during pregnancy, of which 46.9% had a history of depression prior to pregnancy. After history of depression, the second strongest associated factor for major depression was fear of childbirth, with a 2.6-fold (adjusted OR (aOR=2.63, 95% CI 2.39 to 2.89) increased prevalence. The risk profile of major depression also included adolescent or advanced maternal age, low or unspecified socioeconomic status (SES), single marital status, smoking, prior pregnancy terminations, anaemia and gestational diabetes regardless of a history of depression. Outcomes of pregnancies were worse among women with major depression than without. The contribution of smoking was substantial to modest for small-for-gestational age newborn (<-2 SD below mean birth), low birth weight (<2500 g), preterm birth (<37 weeks) and admission to neonatal intensive care associated with major depression, whereas SES made only a minor contribution. CONCLUSIONS: Physician-diagnosed major depression during pregnancy was found to be rare. The strongest risk factor was history of depression prior to pregnancy. Other associated factors were fear of childbirth, low SES, lack of social support and unhealthy reproductive behaviour such as smoking. Outcomes of pregnancies were worse among women with major depression than without. Smoking during pregnancy made a substantial to modest contribution to adverse outcomes associated with depression during pregnancy.", "INTRODUCTION: Ever since the world came into being different factors and circumstances contributed in a deteriorating fashion to mental health, and depression is the commonest of mental disturbance and incapability. We aimed to identify the risk factors for perinatal outcomes of maternal depression. METHODS: Data extracted was from two important cities of Pakistan i.e Islamabad and Karachi, and the numbers are 500,000 and 800,000 respectively. The timeline of the information was from 2010 to 2020 to signify a decade. Women with active pregnancy and depression were included. Chisquare analysis was run to predict which factors had a significant impact on depression. Odds ratio was separately run on the significant factors. Regression analysis was done to describe the relationships between independent variables and each other. RESULTS: The most preferred procedure of delivery was cesarean section in Islamabad and more than 500,000 in Karachi. Low-income women in Karachi had a mean depression score of 12.4 while men with the same socioeconomic class had a score of 23.4. 15.7 females in Islamabad reported medications taken during pregnancy & 34.9 females from major depression group. Mean of 87.9 individuals from Islamabad reported living with husband from no serious depression during pregnancy. In Population of Islamabad, Previous pregnancies and birth weight in comparison with depression is significant having p value 0.00. Maternal age, fetal sex & gestational age are also significant indicators of whether a woman is depressed or not. Apgar scores & violence in relation to depression are significant in Karachi Population having p values of 0.049 and 0.028. CONCLUSION: Female health and neonatal care should be a serious concern, but unfortunately in spite of progression in the field of medicine the low income or third world countries don't have sufficient awareness and due to that Pakistan still reports high maternal and neonatal mortality rates."]}
{"question": "Remote ischemic postconditioning: does it protect against ischemic damage in percutaneous coronary revascularization?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Myocardial damage that is associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) partially affects the results of the procedure, and is related to medium-term cardiovascular death. Remote postischemic conditioning might reduce the myocardial lesions that are associated with PCI, but perhaps less so in diabetics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of remote postischemic conditioning in patients undergoing elective PCI for stable angina or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome with troponin <1 ng/ml at the time of randomization. METHODS: This randomized single-blinded single-center clinical trial involved 320 patients undergoing elective PCI who were randomized to either receive three 5-min cycles of ischemia by inflation of a cuff on the non-dominant arm to 200 mm Hg (remote postischemic conditioning) or to placebo (uninflated cuff). The primary outcome variable was the maximum increase in troponin in the first 24 h. The secondary outcome variable was readmission due to heart failure or cardiovascular mortality after 1 year of follow-up. In addition, a diabetic population was studied.

DESIGN: Single-centre, randomised, blinded to the researchers, clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT 01113008). SETTING: Tertiary hospital centre. PATIENTS: 232 patients underwent elective PCI for stable or unstable angina. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to RIP (induction of three 5-min cycles of ischaemia in the arm after the PCI) versus placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the peak 24-h troponin I level. PCI-MI was defined by an elevation of troponin values >3 or >5 of the 99th percentile according to the classical or the new definition. The secondary outcome measure was hospital admission, PCI for stable angina or acute coronary syndrome and mortality after 1 year of follow-up. The use of RIP in diabetic patients was specifically studied. RESULTS: The mean age was 64.6 years, and 42% were diabetic. The peak troponin in the RIP patients was 0.476 vs 0.478 ng/mL (p=0.99). PCI-MI occurred in 36% of the RIP patients versus 30.8% in the placebo group (p=0.378). Diabetic RIP patients had more PCI-MI (new definition): OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.10 to 6.92; p=0.027. The secondary outcome measure was seen in 11.7% of the RIP patients versus 10.8% in the placebo group (p=0.907). CONCLUSIONS: RIP did not reduce the damage associated with elective PCI or cardiovascular events during the follow-up. The diabetic population who underwent RIP had more PCI-MI."]}
{"question": "Does combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Combining various antiretroviral agents into one single dosage form has been a strategy to reduce pill burden and enhance medication adherence among human immunodeficiency virus /AIDS (HIV/AIDS) patients. OBJECTIVES: This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy. METHOD: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with >/=2 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique. RESULTS: Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with >/=2 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold. CONCLUSION: Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a multidimensional concept involving an individual's self-perception about how a disease or treatment impacts their daily life. In this study, we evaluated the HRQoL and factors associated with this outcome in 366 patients initiating combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.We measured HRQoL using the EuroQoL-5D 3 level (EQ-5D) and the HIV instrument of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-HIV BREF) and identified factors associated with HRQoL using multilevel linear regression. Participants had been on cART treatment a median of 65.5 days at the time the instruments were completed. The median HRQoL of patients on the single-tablet regimen containing efavirenz/ tenofovir/ lamivudine and the multi-tablet regimen containing dolutegravir and tenofovir/ lamivudine were high, with no significant difference between groups. Factors consistently associated with lower HRQoL were being single (unmarried), having a lower educational level, recent cigarette smoking, recent signs and symptoms of anxiety or depression, comorbid disease and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions. We observed high levels of HRQoL in cART-treated people and no differences between dolutegravir and efavirenz-based regimens. This study provides inputs to future economic analysis and identifies opportunities to increase the HRQoL of patients by targeting modifiable factors.", "OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to describe patients' experiences after single-tablet regimen (STR) desimplification and its impact on self-reported treatment adherence and quality of life. METHODS: We performed a survey among all patients from the multicenter cohort of the Spanish HIV/AIDS Network who had desimplified the STRs dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DGT/ABC/3TC) or rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine to their separate components (DTG + generic ABC/3TC or RPV + generic TDF/FTC) between December 2016 and November 2018. RESULTS: Among 216 patients who fulfilled inclusion criteria, 138 (63.9%) completed the questionnaire. Most of the patients (78.3%) knew what generic drugs are, only 8.7% believed that treatment with 2 pills is less effective than treatment with an STR, and 67.4% agreed that it is reasonable to take 2 pills instead of 1 for HIV treatment to decrease costs for the health care system. After desimplification, 13.0% of the patients stated they had more secondary effects, 8.0% had forgotten one or more doses more frequently than before, and 10.9% had sometimes forgotten to take 1 pill, but not the other. A proportion of 30.4% reported not being happy to take more pills a day, and 10.1% experienced a worse quality of life after the treatment desimplification. CONCLUSIONS: After STR desimplification, most of the patients had a fair knowledge about generic antiretrovirals, and they agreed to desimplify their STR to decrease costs.

Patient-reported measures were quality of life (QOL; SF-36 [version 2]), treatment adherence (visual analogue scale), preference of medication (POM), perceived ease of the regimen for condition (PERC), and a 20-item HIV symptom index. Overall, 203 subjects were randomized to EFV/FTC/TDF and 97 to SBR. Fifty-three percent of subjects had previously received a PI-based regimen; 47% an NNRTI-based therapy. Throughout the study, SF-36 summary scores did not differ significantly from baseline, regardless of previous ART or treatment allocation. Adherence was 96% or more in both groups at baseline and all subsequent study visits. At study conclusion, the EFV/FTC/TDF regimen was considered easier to follow than prior regimens by 97% and 96% of subjects previously receiving PI-based and NNRTI-based therapies, respectively. Overall, 91% of subjects switched to EFV/FTC/TDF indicated a preference over their prior therapy. Switching to EFV/FTC/TDF was associated with transient worsening/emergence of dizziness and sustained improvements in several other HIV-related symptoms.

{"question": "The inverse equity hypothesis: does it apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether the inverse equity hypothesis-the idea that new health interventions are initially primarily accessed by the rich, but that inequalities narrow with diffusion to the poor-holds true for cancer screening in low and middle income countries (LMICs).This study examines the relationship between overall coverage and economic inequalities in coverage of cancer screening in four middle-income countries. METHODS: Secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from the WHO study on Global Ageing and Adult Health in China, Mexico, Russia and South Africa (2007-2010). Three regression-based methods were used to measure economic inequalities: (1) Adjusted OR; (2) Relative Index of Inequality (RII); and (3) Slope Index of Inequality. RESULTS: Coverage for breast cancer screening was 10.5% in South Africa, 19.3% in China, 33.8% in Russia and 43% in Mexico, and coverage for cervical cancer screening was 24% in South Africa, 27.2% in China, 63.7% in Mexico and 81.5% in Russia. Economic inequalities in screening participation were substantially lower or non-existent in countries with higher aggregate coverage, for both breast cancer screening (RII: 14.57 in South Africa, 4.90 in China, 2.01 in Mexico, 1.04 in Russia) and cervical cancer screening (RII: 3.60 in China, 2.47 in South Africa, 1.39 in Mexico, 1.12 in Russia). CONCLUSIONS: Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality."]}
{"question": "Identification of racial disparities in breast cancer mortality: does scale matter?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: This paper investigates the impact of geographic scale (census tract, zip code, and county) on the detection of disparities in breast cancer mortality among three ethnic groups in Texas (period 1995-2005). Racial disparities were quantified using both relative (RR) and absolute (RD) statistics that account for the population size and correct for unreliable rates typically observed for minority groups and smaller geographic units. Results were then correlated with socio-economic status measured by the percentage of habitants living below the poverty level. RESULTS: African-American and Hispanic women generally experience higher mortality than White non-Hispanics, and these differences are especially significant in the southeast metropolitan areas and southwest border of Texas. The proportion and location of significant racial disparities however changed depending on the type of statistic (RR versus RD) and the geographic level. The largest proportion of significant results was observed for the RD statistic and census tract data. Geographic regions with significant racial disparities for African-Americans and Hispanics frequently had a poverty rate above 10.00%. CONCLUSIONS: This study investigates both relative and absolute racial disparities in breast cancer mortality between White non-Hispanic and African-American/Hispanic women at the census tract, zip code and county levels. Analysis at the census tract level generally led to a larger proportion of geographical units experiencing significantly higher mortality rates for minority groups, although results varied depending on the use of the relative versus absolute statistics. Additional research is needed before general conclusions can be formulated regarding the choice of optimal geographic regions for the detection of racial disparities."]}
{"question": "Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Disorders of consciousness (DOC) diagnosis relies on the presence or absence of purposeful motor responsiveness, which characterizes the minimally conscious state (MCS) and the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), respectively. Functional neuroimaging studies have raised the question of possible residual conscious awareness also in clinically-defined UWS patients. The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even when no conscious behavior can be observed. METHODS: We enrolled 25 severe DOC patients, following post-anoxic or traumatic brain injury and 20 healthy individuals (HC) as control group. Baseline electrophysiological evaluation evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex. RESULT: a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. CONCLUSION: a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) is a chronic disorder of consciousness (DOC) characterized by a lack of awareness and purposeful motor behaviors, owing to an extensive brain connectivity impairment. Nevertheless, some UWS patients may retain residual brain connectivity patterns, which may sustain a covert awareness, namely functional locked-in syndrome (fLIS). We evaluated the possibility of bringing to light such residual neural networks using a non-invasive neurostimulation protocol. To this end, we enrolled 15 healthy individuals and 26 DOC patients (minimally conscious state-MCS- and UWS), who underwent a gamma-band transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We measured the effects of tACS on power and partial-directed coherence within local and long-range cortical networks, before and after the protocol application. tACS was able to specifically modulate large-scale cortical effective connectivity and excitability in all the MCS participants and some UWS patients, who could be, therefore, considered as suffering from fLIS. Hence, tACS could be a useful approach in supporting a DOC differential diagnosis, depending on the level of preservation of the cortical large-scale effective connectivity.", "OBJECTIVE: Although some patients suffering from unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) may retain some capacity for covert cognition, it is difficult to directly demonstrate this property by means of tasks needing patient active cooperation and preserved top-down attention processes. Instead, specific passive paradigms may allow identifying a residual theta and gamma band functional connectivity within fronto-parietal networks (FPN), which may sustain covert cognitive processes. METHODS: We attempted to highlight such networks in a sample of minimally conscious state (MCS) and UWS patients by means of a cerebellar 5 Hz oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (otDCS), in order to modulate the FPN functional connectivity. RESULTS: We found a FPN theta and gamma power modulation and coherence increase, which were paralleled by a transient coma recovery scale-revised score amelioration, only in MCS individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a functional link between the FPN coherent theta and gamma oscillations and the cerebellar-cerebral output. Moreover, our data highlighted a residual FPN functional connectivity, which is a fundamental prerequisite for objectifying every aware processes and the potential to cognitive processes (covert cognition). SIGNIFICANCE: Our otDCS cerebellar-cerebral connectivity modulation may be a useful approach in improving chronic disorders of consciousness differential diagnosis and ameliorating the level of consciousness."]}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of preoperative TBS in newborns with EA in preventing complications and improving diagnosis and surgical treatment. METHODS: In the period ranging from 1997 to 2003, 62 patients with EA underwent preoperative TBS. The procedure was carried out with flexible bronchoscope maintaining spontaneous breathing. When a wide carinal fistula was found, this was mechanically occluded by Fogarty catheter and cannulated with rigid bronchoscopy. Type of EA, surgical procedure variations caused by TBS, and associated anomalies not easily detectable were recorded. RESULTS: Before TBS, the Gross classification of the 62 patients was as follows: type A, 9 patients; type B, none; type C, 51 patients. At TBS, however, 3 of 9 type A patients had an unsuspected proximal fistula (type B). These 3 patients, plus the 2 with H-type fistula, were repaired through a cervical approach. In 4 patients, previously undetected malformations of the respiratory tree (2 aberrant right upper bronchus and 2 hypoplastic bronchi) were found at TBS. Carinal fistulas in 14 type C patients were occluded by Fogarty catheter to improve ventilation during repair. No complications were observed. Overall, TBS was clinically useful in 28 (45.2%) of 62 patients, including 15 (24.2%) of 62 infants in whom it was crucial in modifying the surgical approach. CONCLUSION: Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair."]}
{"question": "Is horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex influenced by otolith organs input?", "retrieved_passages": ["CONCLUSION: Otolith organs input influences the axis of horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex; therefore, the plane of compensatory eye movements induced by the horizontal canal stimulation is not always parallel to the canal. OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether horizontal canal ocular reflex is influenced by otolith organs input. METHODS: The subjects were seven healthy humans. The right ear was stimulated using ice-water. Each subject was kept in a left-ear-down position for 20 s and then repositioned to a prone position, a right-ear-down position and a supine position with 20 s intervals. Nystagmus was analysed using three-dimensional video-oculography. RESULTS: Eye movements in the supine position and the prone position were not in a symmetric fashion. Nystagmus in the left-ear-down position and the right-ear-down position were not symmetric either. These phenomena indicate that the axis of the eyeball rotation was affected by the shift of the direction of gravity exerted on the head.", "Vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs) rely on neuronal computations that transform vestibular sensory signals into spatio-temporally appropriate extraocular motor commands. The motoneuronal discharge for contractions of the superior oblique eye muscle during linear translation derives from a utricular epithelial sector that is spatially aligned with the pulling direction of this muscle. In Xenopus laevis, the alignment is gradually achieved during larval development and requires motion-related semicircular canal afferent activity. Here, we studied the origin of semicircular canal and utricular signals responsible for the establishment and maturation of the extraocular motor response vector. Experiments were conducted on semi-intact preparations of Xenopus tadpoles before and after unilateral transection of the VIIIth nerve and in preparations of animals in which semicircular canal formation was prevented on one side by the injection of hyaluronidase into the otic capsule prior to the establishment of the tubular structures. Unilateral VIIIth nerve sections revealed that the excitation underlying the contraction of the superior oblique eye muscle during horizontal linear acceleration and clockwise/counter-clockwise roll motion derives exclusively from the utricle and the posterior semicircular canal on the ipsilateral side. In contrast, the developmental constriction of the otolith response vector depends on signals from the posterior semicircular canal on the contralateral side. These latter signals suppress directionally incorrect components that derive from the utricular sector perpendicular to the superior oblique eye muscle. This directional tuning complies with a stabilization of spatially correct utricular inputs that are aligned with the extraocular motor target muscle. In addition, misaligned signals are concurrently suppressed by semicircular canal-related commissural pathways from the contralateral side and through local interneuronal inhibitory circuits within the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei.", "Gaze stabilization during head/body movements is achieved to a large extent by vestibular-evoked compensatory eye movements. These reflexes derive from semicircular canal and otolith organs and depend on the transformation of the respective sensory signals into extraocular motor commands. To elicit directionally and dynamically appropriate compensatory eye movements, extraocular motoneurons require spatiotemporally specific inputs from semicircular canals and regions of the utricular epithelium with matching directional sensitivity. The ontogenetic establishment and maturation of the directional tuning of otolith inputs in extraocular motoneurons was studied in Xenopus laevis tadpoles. In young larvae at stage 46-48, superior oblique (SO) extraocular motoneurons receive omnidirectional utricular signals during horizontal translational motion, indicating an absence of spatial tuning. In contrast, in older larvae beyond stage 49 these motoneurons were activated by directionally more restricted otolith inputs with an increasingly enhanced spatial tuning until stage 53. This developmental process limited the origin of otolith signals to a utricular epithelial sector with a hair cell sensitivity that is coaligned with the pulling direction of the SO eye muscle. The maturation of the otolith response vector was abolished by enzymatic prevention of semicircular canal formation in postembryonic tadpoles at stage 44, suggesting that functionally intact semicircular canals are causally responsible for the observed directional tuning of utricular responses. A likely mechanism by which semicircular canals might influence the tuning of the otolith responses includes stabilization of coactivated and centrally converging sensory signals from semicircular canal and spatially aligned epithelial utricular regions during natural head/body motion.", "The aims of the study were to clarify whether persistent direction-changing geotropic positional nystagmus contains vertical and torsional components, and to quantify the asymmetry. We analyzed nystagmus in four positions (healthy-ear-down, affected-ear-down, supine, nose-down) using three-dimensional video-oculography. Subjects were 18 patients with persistent direction-changing geotropic positional nystagmus, 16 females and 2 males, with a mean age of 55 years. Nystagmus was recorded using an infrared camera and the findings were converted to digital data. Using ImageJ, we performed three-dimensional video-oculography and measured maximum slow-phase velocity (MSV) of three components. Positional nystagmus was not purely horizontal. Eight (44%) patients revealed a vertical component (upward) and 15 (83%) patients had a torsional component in the healthy-ear-down position. Seven (39%) patients revealed a vertical component (downward) and 10 (56%) patients showed a torsional component in the nose-down position. The mean value of MSV of the horizontal component in the supine position was 9.3 degrees /s and that in the nose-down position was 15.7 degrees /s. The latter was significantly greater than the former (p < 0.05). Eye movements in the supine position and the nose-down position were not mirror images. These results suggest that vertical and torsional components occur from the horizontal semicircular canal, and that horizontal canal ocular reflex is influenced by input from the otolithic organs.", "We employed binocular magnetic search coils to study the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and visually enhanced vestibulo-ocular reflex (VVOR) of 15 human subjects undergoing passive, whole-body rotations about a vertical (yaw) axis delivered as a series of pseudorandom transients and sinusoidal oscillations at frequencies from 0.8 to 2.0 Hz. Rotations were about a series of five axes ranging from 20 cm posterior to the eyes to 10 cm anterior to the eyes. Subjects were asked to regard visible or remembered targets 10 cm, 25 cm, and 600 cm distant from the right eye. During sinusoidal rotations, the gain and phase of the VOR and VVOR were found to be highly dependent on target distance and eccentricity of the rotational axis. For axes midway between or anterior to the eyes, sinusoidal gain decreased progressively with increasing target proximity, while, for axes posterior to the otolith organs, gain increased progressively with target proximity. These effects were large and highly significant. When targets were remote, rotational axis eccentricity nevertheless had a small but significant effect on sinusoidal gain. For sinusoidal rotational axes midway between or anterior to the eyes, a phase lead was present that increased with rotational frequency, while for axes posterior to the otolith organs phase lag increased with rotational frequency. Transient trials were analyzed during the first 25 ms and from 25 to 80 ms after the onset of the head rotation. During the initial 25 ms of transient head rotations, VOR and VVOR gains were not significantly influenced by rotational eccentricity or target distance. Later in the transient responses, 25-80 ms from movement onset, both target distance and eccentricity significantly influenced gain in a manner similar to the behavior during sinusoidal rotation. Vergence angle generally remained near the theoretically ideal value during illuminated test conditions (VVOR), while in darkness vergence often varied modestly from the ideal value. Regression analysis of instantaneous VOR gain as a function of vergence demonstrated only a weak correlation, indicating that instantaneous gain is not likely to be directly dependent on vergence. A model was proposed in which linear acceleration as sensed by the otoliths is scaled by target distance and summed with angular acceleration as sensed by the semicircular canals to control eye movements. The model was fit to the sinusoidal VOR data collected in darkness and was found to describe the major trends observed in the data. The results of the model suggest that a linear interaction exists between the canal and otolithic inputs to the VOR."]}
{"question": "Is perforation of the appendix a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To critically assess the evidence that appendiceal perforation is a risk factor for subsequent tubal infertility or ectopic pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: Epidemiologic studies investigating the relationship between appendectomy and infertility or ectopic pregnancy were identified by searching the MEDLINE database from 1966 to 1997. Appropriate citations were also extracted from a manual search of the bibliographies of selected papers. STUDY SELECTION: Twenty-three articles were retrieved. Only 4 presented original data including comparisons to a nonexposed control group and they form the basis for this study. DATA EXTRACTION: Because the raw data or specific techniques of data analysis were not always explicitly described, indices of risk for exposure were extracted from the data as presented and were analysed without attempting to convert them to a common measure. DATA SYNTHESIS: Articles were assessed according to the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group for evaluating articles on harm. Review of the literature yielded estimates of the risk of adverse fertility outcomes ranging from 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.5) for ectopic pregnancy after an appendectomy to 4.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.9) for tubal infertility from perforation of the appendix. Recall bias, and poor adjustment for confounding variables in some reports, weakened the validity of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer."]}
{"question": "Serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: does it exist?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the host immune response to gonorrhoea provides limited serovar specific protection from reinfection. SUBJECTS: 508 episodes of gonorrhoea diagnosed at a city centre genitourinary medicine clinic including 22 patients with multiple infections over a 4 year period. METHODS: Patients with recurrent gonococcal infection were analysed with respect to the initial and subsequent serovars isolated. RESULTS: No significant difference was seen in the prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection compared with those without repeat infections. The site of the initial infection did not appear to influence the subsequent serovar isolated. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "Have potential clues to an effective gonorrhea vaccine been lurking in international disease surveillance data for decades? While no clinically effective vaccines against gonorrhea have been developed we present direct and indirect evidence that a vaccine is not only possible, but may already exist. Experience from Cuba, New Zealand, and Canada suggest that vaccines containing Group B Neisseria meningitides outer membrane vesicles (OMV) developed to control type-specific meningococcal disease may also prevent a significant proportion of gonorrhea. The mechanisms for this phenomenon have not yet been elucidated but we present some strategies for unraveling potential cross protective antigens and effector immune responses by exploiting stored sera from clinical trials and individuals primed with a meningococcal group B OMV vaccine (MeNZB). Elucidating these will contribute to the ongoing development of high efficacy vaccine options for gonorrhea. While the vaccine used in New Zealand, where the strongest empirical evidence has been gathered, is no longer available, the OMV has been included in the multi component recombinant meningococcal vaccine 4CMenB (Bexsero) which is now licensed and used in numerous countries. Several lines of evidence suggest it has the potential to affect gonorrhea prevalence. A vaccine to control gonorrhea does not need to be perfect and modeling supports that even a moderately efficacious vaccine could make a significant impact in disease prevalence. How might we use an off the shelf vaccine to reduce the burden of gonorrhea? What are some of the potential societal barriers in a world where vaccine hesitancy is growing? We summarize the evidence and consider some of the remaining questions.", "BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae is acquiring increasing resistance to available oral antibiotics, and current screening and treatment approaches have not decreased gonorrhea incidence. Although a gonorrhea-specific vaccine does not exist, N. gonorrhoeae shares much of its genome with Neisseria meningitidis, notably critical antigenic determinants including outer membrane vesicles (OMV). Prior observational studies have suggested that OMV-based meningococcal serogroup B vaccines confer protection against gonorrhea. METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study from 2016 to 2020 to examine the association of OMV-containing recombinant meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB) with gonorrhea infection among teens and young adults at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Recipients of 4CMenB were matched in a ratio of 1:4 to recipients of non-OMV-containing polysaccharide-conjugate vaccine targeting serotypes A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY) who had not received 4CMenB and were followed for incident gonorrhea. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to compare gonorrhea rates among recipients of 4CMenB vs MenACWY, adjusting for potential confounders. We conducted the same analysis with chlamydia as a negative control outcome. RESULTS: The study included 6641 recipients of 4CMenB matched to 26 471 recipients of MenACWY. During follow-up, gonorrhea incidence rates per 1000 person-years (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were 2.0 (1.3-2.8) for recipients of 4CMenB and 5.2 (4.6-5.8) for recipients of MenACWY. In adjusted analyses, gonorrhea rates were 46% lower among recipients of 4CMenB vs MenACWY (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, .34-.86), but chlamydia rates were similar between vaccine groups (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, .82-1.17). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest cross-protection of 4CMenB against gonorrhea, supporting the potential for vaccination strategies to prevent gonorrhea.", "Two distinct species of gonococcal porin proteins exist that differ with regard to surface exposure. Protein IB, expressed by strains of the WII/III serogroup, has both termini buried in the outer membrane, leaving a central region of the molecule exposed at the cell surface. We have attempted to define this region of protein IB in detail by studying the antigenic and immunogenic properties of peptides derived from protein IB. Treatment of gonococcal protein IB (serotype 5) with cyanogen bromide resulted in cleavage of protein IB into three major fragments of Mr of 15,000, 13,000, and 8,000. The location of these peptides in the intact protein was determined by analysis of partial cleavage products. The 8,000 Mr peptide (CB2) was found to be located in the central region of the protein. Chymotrypsin cleavage of protein IB revealed a cleavage site near one of the cyanogen bromide cleavage sites. Trypsin was found to cleave the protein, either in outer membranes complexes (OMC) or in detergent micelles, in the central CB2 fragment. These results suggest that CB2 is a part of the surface-exposed region of protein IB. Immunization of mice with purified protein IB (serotype 5) induced antibodies against all three CB-peptides. Absorption of the sera with homologous OMC resulted in a complete removal of antibodies against CB2, supplying further evidence for its surface-exposed nature. Antibodies against the 13,000 Mr peptide (CB1) could not be absorbed with intact OMC, suggesting that this peptide is buried within the outer membrane. Antisera raised against CB2 of serotype 5 demonstrated a considerable cross-reactivity with heterologous outer membranes. On the contrary, intact OMC induced mainly type-specific antibodies. These data demonstrate the presence of conserved epitopes on the surface-exposed CB2 peptide. These conserved epitopes are generally not very immunogenic when present in intact OMC.", "Inherited deficiencies of the complement proteins are rare in unselected populations. Examination of patients with the clinical correlates of complement deficiency (autoimmune disease and certain bacterial infections) shows the frequency of inherited complement deficiency to rise enormously (5.9% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 10 to 25% of adults with sporadic meningococcal disease). Autoimmune diseases of all types, but especially systemic lupus erythematosus, discoid lupus and glomerulonephritis, are seen in all categories of complement deficiency, most typically in those of the early classical pathway (C1, C4, C2). Pneumococcal infections are characteristic of deficiencies of the early classical pathway, as well. Deficiencies of C3 are associated with severe disease including autoimmune phenomena, pneumococcal and neisserial infections. C3-deficient patients become ill substantially earlier in life. Infections with N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae are most typical of the late component deficiencies, with over 40% of homozygotes affected. Despite the presence of this deficiency from birth and the peak age-specific incidence of meningococcal disease in the general population at ages 3-8 months, the median age of first infection in the late component-deficient patients is 17 years. Relapse of infection is ten times more common in these patients, and discrete recurrences are seen in 45% of affected individuals. An unusual and unexplained predilection for infection with serogroup Y N. meningitidis exists. Despite an immune deficiency, and problems with ascertainment bias, it appears that persons with late component complement deficiency enjoy less mortality than normals who contract meningococcal disease. Attempts to explain the pathogenesis of neisserial infection in late component deficiencies have focused on the concept that normally non-pathogenic serum-sensitive bacteria are etiologic in the absence of serum bactericidal activity. Data to support this concept remain to be developed and contrary data exist. A separate mechanism may predispose properdin-deficient patients to meningococcal infection, since they appear to develop fulminant infections with high mortality."]}
{"question": "Are endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas indicative of grade?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The most common primary brain tumors in children and adults are of astrocytic origin. Classic histologic grading schemes for astrocytomas have included evaluating the presence or absence of nuclear abnormalities, mitoses, vascular endothelial proliferation, and tumor necrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the vascular pattern of 17 astrocytoma surgical specimens (seven from children and 10 from adults), and four normal brains obtained at autopsy, utilizing antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) utilizing confocal microscopy. A modified WHO classification was used. RESULTS: All tumor cases showed cells positive for GFAP. Control tissues showed a few, widely separated vessels. Pilocytic astrocytomas (four cases) showed lacy clusters of small-to-medium sized vessels, with intact vessel wall integrity. Diffuse, low grade astrocytoma (three cases) showed a staining pattern similar to control tissue; intermediate grade (one case), anaplastic astrocytoma (three cases) and gliobastoma multiforme (six cases) showed an increased vessel density with multiple small vessels (glomeruloid clusters), some with prominent intimal hyperplasia, loss of vessel wall integrity, and with numerous vWF-positive single cells/microvessels within the tumor substance. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of astrocytomas utilizing antibody to vWF and confocal microscopy aids in the grading of these neoplasms.", "BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study on high grade astrocytic tumors were (i) to establish differences, if any, between grades III & IV tumors among angiogenic parameters, both qualitative and quantitative, and (ii) to correlate angiogenic parameters with proliferation indices, namely T2a and MIB1 labeling indices. DESIGN: Twenty nine consecutive cases of WHO grades III (11) and IV (18) astrocytic tumors diagnosed in the year-2004 were studied, using H&E and CD34, MIB1 and T2a immunostaining by streptavidin biotin technique. Angiogenic patterns were studied and parameters quantitated using Image Pro Plus software (four hotspots) on CD34 immunostained sections to determine intratumoral microvessel density (iMVD), microvascular area (MVA), aspect, mean diameter (MD) and fractal dimension (FD). RESULTS: Main angiogenic patterns of capillary (18) and glomeruloid (9) types were best developed in glioblastomas. Statistically significant differences (P<0.05) were seen between grades III and IV in iMVD, aspect, MD and FD, but not in angiogenic patterns or MVA (P = 0.27). Statistically significant differences (P<0.05) were seen between glioblastomas with glomeruloid vs. capillary types in iMVD and FD, but not in MVA, aspect and mean vessel diameter. T2a values correlated with MIB1 labeling indices (R = 0.965, P<0.001). Intratumoral endothelial MIB1 LI was significantly higher in grade IV as compared to grade III, but did not correlate with angiogenic parameters. No correlation of angiogenic patterns and proliferation indices was noted (R = -0.221, P = 0.26). Limited follow up data showed all recurrent grade IV tumors to be of glomeruloid type. CONCLUSION: Increased angiogenesis in grade IV, as compared to grade III, astrocytic tumors is characterized by an increased number/density of vessels: an increase in vessels characterized by disproportionate lengthening and likely associated with the infiltrative properties of the tumors; and an increase in pliable, irregularly shaped or structured vessels. In addition, there is a greater frequency of glomeruloid structures indicating inadequate directional migration of the newly formed vessels. The lack of correlation of these angiogenesis parameters with the MIB1 and T2a proliferation indices reflects the complexity of angiogenesis parameters in high grade gliomas. Further studies are needed to determine the usefulness of the angiogenic parameters in the improved diagnosis (grading) and prognosis of astrocytic tumors.", "Four human astrocytic gliomas of high grade of malignancy were each evaluated in tissue and in vitro for percentages of cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), collagen type IV, laminin and fibronectin assessed by immunofluorescence with counterstaining of nuclear DNA. Percentages of cells with reticulin and cells binding fluorescein-labeled Ulex europaeus agglutinin were also assessed. In tissue, each extracellular matrix (ECM) component was associated with cells in the walls of abnormal proliferations of glioma vessels, and all four tumors had the same staining pattern. Two strikingly different patterns of conversion of gene product expression emerged during in vitro cultivation. (1). In the most common pattern, percentages of all six markers consistently shifted toward the exact phenotype of mesenchymal cells in abnormal vascular proliferations: increased reticulin, collagen type IV, laminin and fibronectin; markedly decreased glial marker GFAP and absent endothelial marker Ulex europaeus agglutinin. The simplest explanation of this constellation of changes coordinated toward expression of vascular ECM markers is that primary glioma cell cultures are overgrown by mesenchymal cells from the abnormal vascular proliferations of the original glioma. These cell cultures were tested for in situ hybridization (ISH) signals of chromosomes 7 and 10. Cells from one glioma had diploid signals. Cells from the other glioma had aneuploid signals indicating they were neoplastic; however, their signals reflected different numerical chromosomal aberrations than those common to neoplastic glia. (2). The second pattern was different. Cells with ISH chromosomal signals of neoplastic glia retained GFAP, and gained collagen type IV. Their laminin and fibronectin diminished, but persisted among a lower percentage of cells. Cloning and double immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of individual cells with glial and mesenchymal markers. A cell expressing GFAP in addition to either fibronectin, reticulin or collagen type IV is not a known constituent of glioblastoma tissue. This provides evidence of a second mechanism of conversion of gene expression in gliomas.", "Aims of the study were: 1. to establish the prevalence of CD44 protein expression in human astrocytomas; 2. to compare the distribution of the extracellular matrix in these tumors; 3. to investigate the relation between CD 44, the extracellular matrix proteins and the histological grade of the tumor. CD44, Type IV Collagen (Col IV), Laminin (LN), Fibronectin (FN), and Tenascin (TN) expression were detected by immunohistochemistry in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples of 52 astrocytic tumors: 35 glioblastomas (GB), 7 Anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) and 10 astrocytomas (A). The localization of Col IV was observed in the basement membrane of the vessel walls in most of the astrocytomas (88.4%) with a similar pattern obtained with LN staining. 7 of 10 A (70%), 2 of 7 AA (28%) and 9 of 35 GB (25.7%) showed LN positivity. There was a negative correlation between LN expression and tumor grade (p=0.03). FN was either localized in the basement membrane or showed thick multi-layered immunoreactivity of the vessel walls. FN expression was seen in 6 A (60%), 4 AA (57%) and all of 35 GB (100%). The FN distribution was not uniform and its staining intensity showed decrease in GB. 3A (30%), 3 AA (42%), 27 GB (77.1%) showed TN expression in the vessel walls and in some tumor cells of 19 GBs. TN expression was positively correlated with the degree of vascular endothelial proliferation in GB (p<0.05). The expression of CD44s wasseen as plasma membrane positivity of glioma cells in 5 of 10A (50%), 3 of 7AA (42.3%) and 29 of 35 GB (82.8%). The intensity of immunoreaction was quite strong especially near the vessels. There was a good correlation between TN and CD44s expression in human astrocytic tumors (p=0.005). No relationship was observed between GFAP, ECM proteins and CD44s expression. Both CD44s and TN expression showed increase with malignancy in astrocytomas. These findings indicated that the histological malignancy of the astrocytomas was correlated with expression of TN and CD44s. It was suggested that in astrocytomas there was a biological relationship only between CD44 and TN, but none with the other ECM proteins. TN may play a role in angiogenesis in human astrocytic tumors.", "NG2/CSPG4 is a complex surface-associated proteoglycan (PG) recognized to be a widely expressed membrane component of glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) cells and angiogenic pericytes. To determine the precise expression pattern of NG2/CSPG4 on glioblastoma cells and pericytes, we generated a panel of >60 mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the ectodomain of human NG2/CSPG4, partially characterized the mAbs, and performed a high-resolution distributional mapping of the PG in human foetal, adult and glioblastoma-affected brains. The reactivity pattern initially observed on reference tumour cell lines indicated that the mAbs recognized 48 immunologically distinct NG2/CSPG4 isoforms, and a total of 14 mAbs was found to identify NG2/CSPG4 isoforms in foetal and neoplastic cerebral sections. These were consistently absent in the adult brain, but exhibited a complementary expression pattern in angiogenic vessels of both tumour and foetal tissues. Considering the extreme pleomorphism of tumour areas, and with the aim of subsequently analysing the distributional pattern of the NG2/CSPG4 isoforms on similar histological vessel typologies, a preliminary study was carried out with endothelial cell and pericyte markers, and with selected vascular basement membrane (VBM) components. On both tumour areas characterized by 'glomeruloid' and 'garland vessels', which showed a remarkably similar cellular and molecular organization, and on developing brain vessels, spatially separated, phenotypically diversified pericyte subsets with a polarized expression of key surface components, including NG2/CSPG4, were disclosed. Interestingly, the majority of the immunolocalized NG2/CSPG4 isoforms present in glioblastoma tissue were present in foetal brain, except for one isoform that seemed to be exclusive of tumour cells, being absent in foetal brain. The results highlight an unprecedented, complex pattern of NG2/CSPG4 isoform expression in foetal and neoplastic CNS, discriminating between phenotype-specific and neoplastic versus non-neoplastic variants of the PG, thus opening up vistas for more selective immunotherapeutic targeting of brain tumours."]}
{"question": "Do healthier lifestyles lead to less utilization of healthcare resources?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Governments are urged to determine methods to control the use of medical resources and curb the rise of healthcare costs. The question is, do health behaviors have an impact on the use of medical resources? This study aims to identify and understand the difference in the number of outpatient visits and health examinations based on various health behaviors and to determine whether patients seek medical care for illness from the same physicians. METHODS: This study used the dataset derived from the Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of Kaohsiung, Taiwan in 2005. Persons older than 15 years were surveyed using an on-site questionnaire. A total of 2911 persons were enrolled in this study. Independent t-tests, chi-square tests, one-way ANOVA, multiple linear regression and binominal logistic regression were used in the data analysis. RESULTS: The regression model for the frequency of doctor visits, health examinations, and whether the same physician is sought for medical care has demonstrated significant correlations with gender, age and education-level variables. Four health behaviors (i.e., exercise habits, dietary habits, regular blood pressure measurement, drinking habits) exhibited a significant correlation with healthcare utilization (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle."]}
{"question": "Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine if baseline antral follicle assessment may serve as additional information in predicting in vitro fertilization outcome. METHODS: Prospective, descriptive preliminary study of in vitro fertilization outcome. From July 1998 to July 1999, 224 patients underwent antral follicle assessment (follicle 2-6 mm in diameter) on baseline of the planned, stimulated in vitro fertilization cycle. The outcomes were analyzed with respect to antral follicle assessment (< or = 6 or > 6), basal cycle day 3 follicle stimulated hormone (< or = 10 or > 10 IU/L) and maternal age (< or = 35 or > 35 years). RESULTS: The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle > 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle < or = 6 (51% vs. 19%, respectively). Controlling for patient age, and basal follicle stimulated hormone, the pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle > 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle < or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly increased with advancing maternal age, elevated basal follicle stimulated hormone levels, and baseline antral follicle < or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle < or = 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle > or = 6 (33% vs. 1%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers."]}
{"question": "Is fetal gender associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: To investigate if fetal gender (1) affects the risk of having an emergency department (ED) visit for asthma; and (2) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had at least one visit to the ED for asthma during pregnancy. METHODS: We linked two provincial administrative databases containing records on in-patient deliveries and ED visits. The study sample included women who delivered a live singleton baby between April 2003 and March 2004. Pregnant women who made at least one ED visit for asthma were counted as cases and the rest of the women as control subjects. We performed a multivariable analysis using logistic regression to model the risk of having an ED visit for asthma, with fetal gender being one of the predictors. In addition, a series of multivariable logistic regressions were also constructed separately for cases and controls for the following adverse delivery outcomes: low birth weight baby, preterm delivery, and delivery via Caesarian section. RESULTS: Among 109,173 live singleton deliveries, 530 women had visited ED due to asthma during pregnancy. While having an ED visit for asthma was positively associated with teenage pregnancy, low income, and presence of pregnancy-induced hypertension, it was not associated with fetal gender (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.19). Fetal gender was not a significant predictor of adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma ED visit during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.", "Prenatal exposures are associated with childhood asthma, and risk may increase with simultaneous exposures. Pregnant women living in lower-income communities tend to have elevated exposures to a range of potential asthma risk factors, which may interact in complex ways. We examined the association between prenatal exposures and the risk of childhood acute-care clinical encounters for asthma (hospitalizations, emergency department visits, observational stays) using conditional logistic regression with a multivariable smoothing term to model the interaction between continuous variables, adjusted for maternal characteristics and stratified by sex. All births near the New Bedford Harbor (NBH) Superfund site (2000-2006) in New Bedford, Massachusetts, were followed through 2011 using the Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) Data System to identify children aged 5-11 years with acute-care clinical asthma encounters (265 cases among 7787 children with follow-up). Hazard ratios (HRs) were higher for children living closer to the NBH site with higher umbilical cord blood lead levels than in children living further away from the NBH site with lower lead levels (P <.001). HRs were higher for girls (HR = 4.17; 95% CI, 3.60-4.82) than for boys (HR = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.46-2.02). Our results suggest that prenatal lead exposure in combination with residential proximity to the NBH Superfund site is associated with childhood asthma acute-care clinical encounters.

{"question": "Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate mutations in genes encoding the slow component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)) channel in familial atrial fibrillation (AF). BACKGROUND: Although AF can have a genetic etiology, links between inherited gene defects and acquired factors such as atrial stretch have not been explored. METHODS: Mutation screening of the KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNE3 genes was performed in 50 families with AF. The effects of mutant protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using electrophysiological studies and human atrial action potential modeling. RESULTS: One missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a high prevalence of hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of wild-type or R14C KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically significant differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at baseline, or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling/stretch, mutant channels showed a marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development."]}
{"question": "Are adult body circumferences associated with height?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Weight scales as height squared, which is an observation that forms the basis of body mass index (weight/height(2)). If, and how, circumferences, including waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC), scale to height remains unclear, but this is an important consideration when developing normative ranges or applying WC/height and HC/height as risk indexes. OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to examine the scaling of weight, WC, and HC to height in NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) III participants. DESIGN: Subjects were adult non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American men (n = 7422) and nonpregnant women (n = 7999) who had complete demographic and anthropometric data. In addition to height, allometric models were developed for each measure that controlled for age, race, and self-reported health status. RESULTS: After adjustment for age and race, weight scaled to height in men and women with mean (+/-SEE) powers of 2.29 +/- 0.11 and 1.80 +/- 0.07, respectively (both P < 0.001). Although univariate circumference-height models were weak or nonsignificant, when adjusted for age and race WC and HC scaled to height with powers of 0.76 +/- 0.08 and 0.45 +/- 0.05, respectively, in men and 0.80 +/- 0.05 and 0.53 +/- 0.04, respectively, in women (all P < 0.001). Age- and race-adjusted incremental increases in circumferences ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 cm per centimeter increase in height. Both WC/height and HC/height scaled negatively to height in men and women, and WC/HC scaled negatively to height in women only (all P < 0.001). Health status-adjusted models were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "Body mass index (BMI) corrects body weight for height and is well established for diagnosing overweight and obesity and correlating with many medical conditions. Waist circumference (WC) is used to diagnose abdominal obesity. However, the correlation of BMI and WC is high, around 0.9, making the use of BMI and WC in concert challenging. A body shape index (ABSI) is a new measure of risk associated with abdominal size. Derived in 2012, ABSI is analogous to BMI in that it normalizes WC for weight and height (and thus to BMI). A similar derivation led to hip index (HI), normalizing hip circumference for BMI. Hazard ratios (HRs) for univariate risk associations of the independent measures height, BMI, ABSI, and HI can be multiplied to give a combined HR, the anthropometric risk indicator (ARI). Compared to any one anthropometric factor, including BMI and WC, ARI more accurately estimates personalized mortality hazard. Published work on ABSI, HI, and ARI supports their association with many aspects of health, including cardiometabolic conditions related to the metabolic syndrome.", "OBJECTIVE: A recent, cross-sectional analysis of adults found that the hip circumference divided by height(1.5) minus 18 (the body adiposity index, BAI) was strongly correlated (r = 0.79) with percent body fat determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The BAI was proposed as a more accurate index of body fatness than BMI. We examined whether BAI was more strongly related, than was BMI and waist circumference, to skinfold thicknesses and levels of various risk factors for coronary heart disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of adults (n = 14,263 for skinfold thickness; n=6291 for fasting lipid levels) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III, 1988-1994. RESULTS: As compared with BMI and waist circumference, we found that BAI was less strongly associated with the skinfold sum and with risk factor levels. For example, correlations with the skinfold sum were r = 0.79 (BMI) vs. r = 0.70 (BAI) among men, and r = 0.86 (BMI) vs. r = 0.79 (BAI) among women; p < 0.001 for the difference between each pair of correlations. An overall index of the 7 risk factors was also more strongly associated with BMI and waist circumference than BAI in analyses stratified by sex, race-ethnicity and age. Multivariable analyses indicated that if BMI was known, BAI provided little additional information on risk factor levels. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the observed associations with risk factor levels and skinfold thicknesses, we conclude that BAI is unlikely to be a better index of adiposity than BMI.", "OBJECTIVES: Studies have demonstrated that rs373863828, a missense variant in CREBRF, is associated with a number of anthropometric traits including body mass index (BMI), obesity, percent body fat, hip circumference, and abdominal circumference. Given the biological relationship between height and adiposity, we hypothesized that the effect of this variant on BMI might be due in part to an association of this variant with height. METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that minor allele of rs373863828 is associated with height in a Samoan population in two adult cohorts and in a separate cohort of children (age 5-18 years old) using linear mixed modeling. RESULTS: We found evidence of a strong relationship between rs373863828 and greater mean height in Samoan adults (0.77 cm greater average height for each copy of the minor allele) with the same direction of effect in Samoan children. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the missense variant rs373863828 in CREBRF, first identified through an association with larger BMI, may be related to an underlying biological mechanism affecting overall body size including stature.", "AIMS: We hypothesized that height-corrected abdominal size (supine sagittal abdominal diameter/height ratio [SADHtR] or waist circumference/height ratio [WHtR]) would associate more strongly than body mass index (BMI, weight/height(2)) with levels of fasting insulin, triglycerides, and three derived biomarkers of insulin resistance. METHODS: Anthropometry, including SAD by caliper, was collected on 4398 adults in the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. For comparison purposes, each adiposity indicator was scaled to its population-based, sex-specific, interquartile range (IQR). For each biomarker we created four outcome groups based on equal-sized populations with ascending values. Multivariable polytomous logistic regression modeled the relationships between the adiposity indicators and each biomarker. RESULTS: Highest-group insulin was associated with a one-IQR increment of BMI (RR 4.3 [95% CI 3.9-4.9]), but more strongly with a one-IQR increment of SADHtR (RR 5.7 [5.0-6.6]). For highest-group HOMA-IR the RR for BMI (4.2 [3.7-4.6]) was less than that of SADHtR (6.0 [5.1-7.0]). Similarly, RRs for BMI were smaller than those for SADHtR applying to highest-group triglycerides (RR 1.6 vs 2.1), triglycerides/HDL-cholesterol (RR 1.9 vs 2.4) and TyG index (RR 1.7 vs 2.2) (all p\u202f<\u202f.001). The RRs for WHtR were consistently between those for SADHtR and BMI. The top 25% of insulin resistance among US adults was estimated to lie above adiposity thresholds of 0.140 for SADHtR, 0.606 for WHtR, or 29.6\u202fkg/m(2) for BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Relative abdominal size rather than relative weight may better define adiposity associated with homeostatic insulin resistance. These population-based, cross-sectional findings could improve anthropometric prediction of cardiometabolic risk."]}
{"question": "Traumatic aortic injury: does the anatomy of the aortic arch influence aortic trauma severity?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Traumatic aortic injury (TAI) is a rare but life-threatening type of injury. We investigate whether the anatomy of the aortic arch influences the severity of aortic injury. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of twenty-two cases treated with TEVAR for TAI in our department from 2009 to 2014. Aortic injury was assessed in accordance with the recommendations of the Society of Vascular Surgery. We measured the aortic arch angle and the aortic arch index, based on the initial angio-CT scan, in each of the analyzed cases. RESULTS: The mean aortic arch index and mean aortic arch angle were 6.8 cm and 58.3 degrees , respectively, in the type I injury group; 4.4 cm and 45.9 degrees  in the type III group; 3.3 cm and 37 degrees  in the type IV group. There were substantial differences in both the aortic arch index and the aortic arch angle of the type III and IV groups. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the aortic arch angle was significantly associated with the occurrence of type III damage (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.03-2.2). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.", "Of all patients presenting at our level 1 trauma center with multiorgan system injuries, 33 have been identified with acute lesions of the thoracic aorta. Mean severity injury score was 24 +/- 3. Four patients underwent resuscitative thoracotomy upon arrival in the emergency department. One survived and fully recovered. The rest underwent diagnostic procedures and repair of aortic lesions in conjunction with surgical treatment of other injured organ systems. The overall survival rate was 82 percent. Survivors arrived significantly faster to the ED and had lesser degree of multiorgan system injuries. There was no difference in the time spent to make the diagnosis of acute aortic disruption for survivors and nonsurvivors, nor was a difference in time to arrive in the operating room once the diagnosis of aortic injury has been established. Morbidity was related to ischemia to distal organs in four patients of whom two presented with multiple lesions of the thoracic aorta; two remained paralyzed and two had only lower limb spasticity. All discharged survivors were alive at 12 months' follow-up. The type of surgical repair did not influence the outcome of patients with single, typical aortic lesions; however, \"clamp/sew\" technique was not adequate when multiple aortic tears were found intraoperatively. The outcome of surgical treatment of the traumatic aortic lesions of patients with polytrauma may be influenced by the speed of arrival to the ED, the magnitude of multiorgan system involvement, and the application of appropriate surgical technique for repair according to the intrathoracic findings and the timing of aortic repair vis-a-vis other surgical treatment.", "PURPOSE: To develop a risk score based on physical examination and chest X-ray findings to rapidly identify major trauma patients at risk of acute traumatic aortic injury (ATAI). METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted with 640 major trauma patients with associated blunt chest trauma classified into ATAI (aortic injury) and NATAI (no aortic injury) groups. The score data set included 76 consecutive ATAI and 304 NATAI patients from a single center, whereas the validation data set included 52 consecutive ATAI and 208 NATAI patients from three independent institutions. Bivariate analysis identified variables potentially influencing the presentation of aortic injury. Confirmed variables by logistic regression were assigned a score according to their corresponding beta coefficient which was rounded to the closest integer value (1-4). RESULTS: Predictors of aortic injury included widened mediastinum, hypotension less than 90 mmHg, long bone fracture, pulmonary contusion, left scapula fracture, hemothorax, and pelvic fracture. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.96. In the score data set, sensitivity was 93.42 %, specificity 85.85 %, Youden's index 0.79, positive likelihood ratio 6.60, and negative likelihood ratio 0.08. In the validation data set, sensitivity was 92.31 % and specificity 85.1 %. CONCLUSIONS: Given the relative infrequency of traumatic aortic injury, which often leads to missed or delayed diagnosis, application of our score has the potential to draw necessary clinical attention to the possibility of aortic injury, thus providing the chance of a prompt specific diagnostic and therapeutic management."]}

{"question": "Regional anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture: does it decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture in geriatric patients has a substantial economic impact and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. At our institution, a regional anesthesia program was instituted for patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. This retrospective cohort review examines the effects of regional anesthesia (from mainly after July 2007) vs general anesthesia (mainly prior to July 2007) on morbidity, mortality and hospitalization costs. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved data collection from electronic and paper charts of 308 patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture from September 2006 to December 2008. Data on postoperative morbidity, in-patient mortality, and cost of hospitalization (as estimated from data on hospital charges) were collected and analyzed. Seventy-three patients received regional anesthesia and 235 patients received general anesthesia. During July 2007, approximately halfway through the study period, a regional anesthesia and analgesia program was introduced. RESULTS: The average cost of hospitalization in patients who received surgery for hip fracture was no different between patients who receive regional or general anesthesia ($16,789 + 631 vs $16,815 + 643, respectively, P = 0.9557). Delay in surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) admission resulted in significantly higher hospitalization costs. Age, male gender, African American race and ICU admission were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality and rates of readmission are not statistically different between the two anesthesia groups. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization."]}
{"question": "Treadmill testing of children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory: does peak oxygen uptake reflect maximum oxygen uptake?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Earlier studies have demonstrated low peak oxygen uptake ((.)Vo(2)peak) in children with spina bifida. Low peak heart rate and low peak respiratory exchange ratio in these studies raised questions regarding the true maximal character of (.)Vo(2)peak values obtained with treadmill testing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the Vo(2)peak measured during an incremental treadmill test is a true reflection of the maximum oxygen uptake ((.)Vo(2)max) in children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was used for this study. METHODS: Twenty children who had spina bifida and were ambulatory participated. The (.)Vo(2)peak was measured during a graded treadmill exercise test. The validity of (.)Vo(2)peak measurements was evaluated by use of previously described guidelines for maximum exercise testing in children who are healthy, as well as differences between Vo(2)peak and (.)Vo(2) during a supramaximal protocol ((.)Vo(2)supramaximal). RESULTS: The average values for (.)Vo(2)peak and normalized (.)Vo(2)peak were, respectively, 1.23 L/min (SD=0.6) and 34.1 mL/kg/min (SD=8.3). Fifteen children met at least 2 of the 3 previously described criteria; one child failed to meet any criteria. Although there were no significant differences between (.)Vo(2)peak and Vo(2)supramaximal, 5 children did show improvement during supramaximal testing. LIMITATIONS: These results apply to children who have spina bifida and are at least community ambulatory. CONCLUSIONS: The (.)Vo(2)peak measured during an incremental treadmill test seems to reflect the true (.)Vo(2)max in children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory, validating the use of a treadmill test for these children. When confirmation of maximal effort is needed, the addition of supramaximal testing of children with disability is an easy and well-tolerated method."]}
{"question": "Is the probability of prenatal diagnosis or termination of pregnancy different for fetuses with congenital anomalies conceived following assisted reproductive techniques?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To compare the probability of prenatal diagnosis (PND) and termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA) between fetuses conceived by assisted reproductive techniques (ART) and spontaneously-conceived fetuses with congenital heart defects (CHD). DESIGN: Population-based observational study. SETTING: Paris and surrounding suburbs. POPULATION: Fetuses with CHD in the Paris registry of congenital malformations and cohort of children with CHD (Epicard). METHODS: Comparison of ART-conceived and spontaneously conceived fetuses taking into account potential confounders (maternal characteristics, multiplicity and year of birth or TOPFA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Probability and gestational age at PND and TOPFA for ART-conceived versus spontaneously conceived fetuses. RESULTS: The probability of PND (28.1% versus 34.6%, P = 0.077) and TOPFA (36.2% versus 39.2%, P = 0.677) were not statistically different between ART-conceived (n = 171) and spontaneously conceived (n = 4620) fetuses. Estimates were similar after adjustment for potential confounders. Gestational age at PND tended to be earlier for ART fetuses (23.1 versus 24.8 weeks, P = 0.05) but no statistical difference was found after adjustment for confounders. Gestational age at TOPFA was comparable between ART-conceived and spontaneously conceived fetuses. CONCLUSIONS: In our population, ART conception was not significantly associated with the probability of PND or TOPFA for CHD. One implication of our results is that live births may be adequate for assessing the overall risk of CHD related to ART. However, total prevalence, in particular of severe CHD, would not be adequately assessed if TOPFA are not included.", "OBJECTIVE: There is no consensus in current practice guidelines on whether conception by in-vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) techniques is an indication for performing a fetal echocardiogram. The aim of the study was to assess whether congenital heart defects (CHD) occur more often in pregnancies conceived after IVF/ICSI as compared with those conceived spontaneously. METHODS: A systematic search for studies was conducted of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus from inception to September 2017. The search included the following medical subject heading (MeSH) terms alone or in different combinations: 'IVF', 'IVF/ICSI', 'ART pregnancy', 'assisted conception', 'birth defect', 'congenital heart defects' and 'congenital malformation or abnormalities'. Studies comparing neonatal incidence of CHD in pregnancies conceived after IVF/ICSI and those conceived spontaneously were included. Studies reporting on other types of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or lacking information concerning termination of pregnancy were excluded. Chromosomal abnormalities were excluded in all analyzed studies. A meta-analysis of selected cohort studies was conducted to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI using a random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity among the studies was evaluated with the I(2) statistic and Q-test. RESULTS: Forty-one studies were identified for review including six case-control and 35 cohort studies. Data of eight selected cohort studies were used for meta-analysis. A total of 25 856 children conceived from IVF/ICSI techniques and 287 995 children conceived spontaneously, involving both singleton and multiple gestations, were included in the analysis. Total CHD events were 337/25 856 (1.30%) and 1952/287 995 (0.68%) in the IVF/ICSI and spontaneous conception groups, respectively. The risk of CHD was significantly increased in the IVF/ICSI group as compared with the spontaneous conception group (pooled OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20-1.76; P = 0.0001; I(2)  = 44%; P = 0.08). In the subgroup of singleton IVF pregnancies, a significant difference was also obtained (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.21-1.99; P = 0.0005; I(2)  = 36%; P = 0.18) and also multiple confounding factors adjusted ORs showed statistical significance (pooled OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.60; P = 0.02; I(2)  = 0%; P = 0.43). CONCLUSION: Fetuses conceived with IVF/ICSI methods are at an increased risk of developing CHD compared with those conceived spontaneously.

Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.", "The incidence of significant birth defects or genetic disorders in pregnancy is approximately 3%. Some will be found to have a congenital or genetic defect during childhood or early adulthood. The demands of modern society are for a healthy 'perfect' baby. Recent technological advances have enabled the development of techniques aimed at early diagnosis of the abnormal fetus, at a point where parents who wish to do so may terminate the pregnancy. Some of these techniques render the woman and fetus at risk of harm, whereas in others, efficacy has not yet been established. The implementation of these techniques raises several ethical questions which will be discussed in this article. We will also give a concise scientific background to the available techniques.", "The aim of this study was to test whether women who conceived after a period of subfertility are less likely to undergo invasive prenatal testing (IPT) and determine factors of influence in that decision. We conducted a retrospective study at the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC+) to compare the rates of IPT following abnormal results of combined first trimester screening (cFTS) or second trimester screening (STS), or because of advanced maternal age among women tested for the effect of type and duration of subfertility and history of fertility investigations and/or treatment. We included 977 women who underwent IPT between January 2010 and December 2013. The women who conceived after fertility investigations and/or treatment had lower rates of IPT following abnormal STS (12.6% vs. 20.0%, OR = 0.58, 95% CI; 0.34-0.97). The difference was not statistically significant after correction for maternal age and severity of the foetal anomaly. Maternal age was, in contrast to fertility treatment or duration of subfertility, related to the choice of IPT among formerly subfertile women. Therefore, the lower uptake of IPT in women conceiving after a period of subfertility is dependent on the indication for IPT and maternal age and less on the type and duration of subfertility.", "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of perinatal infection from maternal exposure is increasing. The prevalence of acute maternal infections identifies cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, toxoplasmosis, and varicella as the most common organisms and in the order of frequency. Maternal informed consent and understanding is required before intrauterine testing for fetal infectious and possible genetic risk assessment. METHODS: This structured review of the reproductive published literature focuses on the risks of amniocentesis and cordocentesis diagnostic procedure-related fetal loss rates and fetal vertical transmission (VT) rates from published infected pregnant cohorts. RESULTS: The total postprocedure fetal loss rate for diagnostic amniocentesis procedures, in limited infectious cohorts, is 1.5% and does not appear to be increased compared to \"noninfected\" amniocentesis cohorts using an estimated background spontaneous fetal loss rate (no procedure) of 0.65%. The \"pooled\" unintended fetal loss rate is from small infected population cohorts, but can be used for counseling purposes. Postcordocentesis fetal loss risk, in an infected cohort, is not possible to estimate due to limited data. The \"biological spontaneous fetal loss rate\" risk with a perinatal infection (positive or negative fetal anomalies) and no diagnostic procedure before 20 weeks of gestation is reviewed. The risk of VT in acute infection cohorts as a result of the intra-amniotic diagnostic procedure is not found to be increased. CONCLUSION: The unintended \"fetal loss\" rate after amniocentesis for perinatal infected cohorts is similar to that of noninfected cohorts, but the estimate is based on limited infected cohorts. There was no procedure-based risk of fetal VT in the infected cohorts, but identification of postprocedure maternal bleeding into the amniotic cavity increases the potential risk. Maternal knowledge translation and an informed consent process with risk-benefit maternal/fetal risk counseling are required prior to any diagnostic amniocentesis procedure."]}
{"question": "Is there a relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation?", "retrieved_passages": ["Background: Ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) may require adjunctive methods of substrate modification. Both ablation-targeting complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during AF and fractionated electrograms recorded during sinus rhythm (sinus rhythm fractionation [SRF]) have been described. However, the relationship of CFAEs with SRF is unclear.  Methods: Twenty patients (age 62 ± 9 years, 13 males) with persistent AF and 9 control subjects without organic heart disease or AF (age 36 ± 6 years, 4 males) underwent detailed CFAE and SRF left atrial electroanatomic maps. The overlap in left atrial regions with CFAEs and SRF was compared in the AF population, and the distribution of SRF was compared among patients with AF and normal controls. Propagation maps were analyzed to identify the activation patterns associated with SR fractionation. Results: SRF (338 ± 150 points) and CFAE (418 ± 135 points) regions comprised 29% ± 14% and 25% ± 15% of the left atrial surface area, respectively. There was no significant correlation between SRF and CFAE maps (r = .2; P = NS). On comparing patients with AF and controls, no significant difference was found in the distribution of SRF between groups (P = .74). Regions of SRF overlapped areas of wave-front collision 75% ± 13% of the time. Conclusions: (1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target."]}

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-six Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 (groups E and L). Each group was further subdivided into 6 subgroups (EA1, EA2, EA3, EB1, EB2, EB3, LA1, LA2, LA3, LB1, LB2, LB3), each containing 8 rats. Intestinal anastomosis was performed by polyglactin 910 sutures in A subgroups and with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate in B subgroups. The anastomosis was end to end in A1 and B1, side to side in A2 and B2, and end to side in A3 and B3. Time for anastomosis performance (AT) was recorded. In group E, bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels were determined on the second postoperative day, whereas in group L, the same measurements were made on the sixth postoperative day. One-way analysis of variance was used for analyses of variance in the groups. Quantitative data were analyzed with Student's t test. P value was considered significant at less than .05. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between bursting pressures of subgroup pairs on both postoperative days 2 and 6. Hydroxyproline levels and AT were significantly better in B subgroups. CONCLUSION: Better healing, shorter AT, and equal strength were achieved with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate compared with polyglactin 910 sutures in intestinal anastomosis in the experimental setting."]}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two bone blocks were extracted from fresh bovine pelvic bone. Four groups were created based on bone type (iliac or pubic region) and presence or absence of cortical bone. Specimens were micro-computed tomography imaged to evaluate trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, bone volume density (BV/TV), BMD, and cortical thickness. Miniscrews 1.4 mm in diameter and 6 mm long were inserted into the bone blocks, and primary stability was evaluated by insertion torque (IT), mini-implant mobility (PTV), and pull-out strength (PS). RESULTS: Intergroup comparison showed lower levels of primary stability when the BMD of trabecular bone was lower and in the absence of cortical bone (P</=.05). The Pearson correlation test showed correlation between trabecular number, trabecular thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD, and IT, PTV, and PS. There was correlation between cortical thickness and IT and PS (P</=.05).

{"question": "Is there any evidence of a \"July effect\" in patients undergoing major cancer surgery?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The \"July effect\" refers to the phenomenon of adverse impacts on patient care arising from the changeover in medical staff that takes place during this month at academic medical centres in North America. There has been some evidence supporting the presence of the July effect, including data from surgical specialties. Uniformity of care, regardless of time of year, is required for patients undergoing major cancer surgery. We therefore sought to perform a population-level assessment for the presence of a July effect in this field. METHODS: We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to abstract data on patients undergoing 1 of 8 major cancer surgeries at academic medical centres between Jan. 1, 1999, and Dec. 30, 2009. The primary outcomes examined were postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality. Univariate analyses and subsequently multivariate analyses, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were performed to identify whether the time of surgery was an independent predictor of outcome after major cancer surgery. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, the overall postoperative complication rate, as well as genitourinary and hematologic complications specifically, was higher in July than the rest of the year. However, on multivariate analysis, only hematologic complications were significantly higher in July, with no difference in overall postoperative complication rate or in-hospital mortality for all 8 surgeries considered separately or together.

We sought to determine the effect of admission month on in-hospital mortality, complications, length of hospitalization, and costs for patients undergoing head and neck cancer (HNCA) surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: Discharge data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 48,263 patients who underwent an ablative procedure for a malignant oral cavity, laryngeal, hypopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal neoplasm in 2005 to 2008 were analyzed using cross-tabulations and multivariate regression modeling. RESULTS: There were 3,812 cases admitted in July (8%). July admission was significantly associated with Medicaid (RRR 1.40, P = 0.011) or self-pay payor status (RRR 1.40, P = 0.022), medium hospital bed size (RRR 1.63, P = 0.033) and large hospital bed size (RRR 1.73, P = 0.013). There was no association between July admission and other patient or hospital demographic characteristics. Major procedures and comorbidity were significantly associated with in-hospital death, surgical and medical complications, length of hospitalization, and costs, but no association was found for July admission, July through September discharge, or teaching hospital status and short-term morbidity or mortality. Teaching hospitals and large hospital bed size were predictors of increased length of hospitalization and costs; and private, for profit hospitals were additionally associated with increased costs. No interaction between July admission and teaching hospitals was found for any of the outcome variables studied. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not support evidence of a \"July effect\" or an increase in morbidity or mortality at teaching hospitals providing HNCA surgical care."]}

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the need for ENBD on the clinical outcomes of patients with acute cholangitis undergoing endoscopic clearance of common bile duct (CBD) stones. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 104 patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis who underwent primary endoscopic treatment were compared according to insertion of an ENBD tube (51 in the ENBD group and 53 in the no-ENBD group). INTERVENTION: Insertion of an ENBD tube after clearance of CBD stones. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Recurrence of cholangitis and length of hospital stay after clearance of CBD stones. RESULTS: Baseline clinical characteristics were similar between both groups. There were no significant differences in the recurrence rate of cholangitis at 24 weeks (3.9% for the ENBD group vs 3.8% for the no-ENBD group at 24 weeks; P = .99) and length of hospital stay (7.9 days [standard error = 1.2] for the ENBD group vs 7.9 days [standard error = 0.7] for the no-ENBD group; P = .98).

After a thorough history and physical examination, a retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. If findings were positive, further investigation was undertaken to rule out systemic disorder or child abuse. RESULTS: One child was found with unilateral retinal haemorrhages following an episode of a simple febrile convulsion. A thorough investigation uncovered no other reason for this finding.

Pre-consultation, patients expressed reluctance to allow students to conduct some or all aspects of the consultation independently. However, after the consultation, they reported they would have accepted higher levels of involvement than actually occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need."]}
{"question": "Can Flexible Instruments Create Adequate Femoral Tunnel Lengths at 90\u00b0 of Knee Flexion in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: This study aims to study femoral tunnel lengths drilled with a flexible reamer and the distance to important lateral structures obtained by flexing the knee at various angles and by drilling the guide pins arthroscopically to resemble clinical practice. The purpose of this cadaveric study was twofold: 1. to determine whether femoral tunnel lengths of greater than 20 mm can be created with a flexible reamer system at 90  degrees  of knee flexion and 2. to determine whether the lateral structures of the knee are safe with this technique. METHODS: Ten fresh cadaveric knees were utilized. The intra-osseous length can be measured with a specially de - signed flexible guide pin. Flexible pins were inserted with the knee at 70 degrees , 90 degrees , and 120 degrees  of flexion. The intra-osseous length was measured with the measuring device. Each speci - men was dissected around the lateral aspect of the knee to identify the critical structures, the common peroneal nerve, and the LCL. The distance from the guide pins to the com - mon peroneal nerve and femoral attachment of the LCL were measured with a standard flexible paper ruler to the nearest millimeter. RESULTS: There is a trend for progressively increasing mean intra-osseous length associated with increased flexion of the knee. The mean intra-osseous length for 70 degrees  flexion was 25.2 mm (20 mm to 32 mm), which was statistically significant when compared to mean intra-osseous lengths of 32.1 mm (22 mm to 45 mm) and 38.0 mm (34 mm to 45 mm) in the 90 degrees  and 120 degrees  flexion groups, respectively (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences among the groups with respect to distance to the LCL. There is a trend toward longer distances to the common peroneal nerve with increased flexion. There was a statistically significant dif - ference when comparing 120 degrees  versus 70 degrees  (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "PURPOSE: To use 3-dimensional custom CAD technology to evaluate how knee flexion angle affects femoral tunnel length and distance to the posterior wall when using curved and straight guides for drilling through the anteromedial portal (AMP). METHODS: Six cadaveric knees were placed in an external fixator at various degrees of flexion (90 degrees , 110 degrees , 125 degrees , and maximum 135 degrees  to 140 degrees ). Computed tomography scans were obtained at all flexion points for 3-dimensional point-cloud models. Using custom CAD software, surgical guides through the AMP were replicated along with virtual tunnels at each flexion angle. Distance from the posterior cortex and tunnel dimensions were collected after 8-mm and 10-mm tunnel creation. RESULTS: At 90 degrees  of flexion, the average tunnel length down the posterior aspect of 8-mm tunnel was 25.0 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.2-33.8) and 12.0 mm (95% CI 7.3-16.7) for curved and straight guides, respectively; 31.0 mm (95% CI 26.8-35.2) and 28.6 mm (95% CI 24.8-32.4) at 110 degrees ; 33.8 mm (95% CI 30.1-37.5) and 31.1 mm (95% CI 26.8-35.4) at 125 degrees ; and 35.0 mm (95% CI 34.1-35.9) and 35.5 mm (95% CI 34.2-36.8) with maximal flexion. Values between curved and straight guides are significantly different (P < .001), with straight guides breaching the posterior wall at 90 degrees  and 110 degrees  of flexion in some specimens. The average distance to the posterior wall cortex was 0.9 mm (95% CI -1.5 to 3.3) and -0.6 mm (95% CI -2.3 to 1.1) for curved and straight guides, respectively, at 90 degrees  of flexion (P = .014); 2.3 mm (95% CI -0.2 to 4.8) and -0.1 mm (95% CI -2.4 to 2.2) at 110 degrees  (P = .001); 4.4 mm (95% CI 2.8-6.0) and 3.9 mm (95% CI 1.9-5.9) at 125 degrees  (P = .299); and 6.7 mm (95% CI 6.2-7.2) and 8.3 mm (95% CI 6.1-10.5) at maximal flexion (P = .184). Posterior wall blowout was noted when using 10-mm straight guides at both 90 degrees  (2 specimens) and 110 degrees  (3 specimens). Using 10-mm curved guides posterior blowout was noted in 1 specimen at 90 degrees . Maximum footprint coverage occurred at 110 degrees  for straight guides and 90 degrees for curved guides. CONCLUSIONS: When using the AMP, flexible guides and reamers result in a greater distance of the tunnel to the femoral cortex while preserving adequate tunnel length at lower knee flexion angles. To create long femoral tunnels without breaching the posterior cortex, the knee should be flexed to at least 110 degrees  for curved reamers and 125 degrees  for straight. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Femoral tunnel drilling through the AMP using curved and straight reamers requires different degrees of knee flexion to achieve optimal tunnel dimensions."]}
{"question": "Quality of life in lung cancer patients: does socioeconomic status matter?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: As part of a prospective study on quality of life in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients an investigation was carried out to examine whether there were differences among patients' quality of life scores and their socioeconomic status. METHODS: Quality of life was measured at two points in time (baseline and three months after initial treatment) using three standard instruments; the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the European Organization for Research and Cancer Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its lung cancer supplement (QLQ-LC13). Socioeconomic status for each individual patient was derived using Carstairs and Morris Deprivation Category ranging from 1 (least deprived) to 7 (most deprived) on the basis of the postcode sector of their address. RESULTS: In all, 129 lung cancer patients entered into the study. Of these data for 82 patients were complete (at baseline and follow-up). 57% of patients were of lower socioeconomic status and they had more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms as compared to affluent patients. Of these, physical mobility (P = 0.05), energy (P = 0.01), role functioning (P = 0.04), physical functioning (P = 0.03), and breathlessness (P = 0.02) were significant at baseline. However, at follow-up assessment there was no significant difference between patient groups nor did any consistent pattern emerge. CONCLUSION: At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics."]}
{"question": "Does delivery mode affect women's postpartum quality of life in rural China?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of life. BACKGROUND: Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study design. METHODS: Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. RESULTS: The overall caeserean section rate was 70.0% (962/1375), and most of them (59.7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys."]}
{"question": "Menopausal hormone therapy and irregular endometrial bleeding: a potential role for uterine natural killer cells?", "retrieved_passages": ["CONTEXT: Irregular bleeding affects many users of combined menopausal hormone therapy (HT) and commonly leads to invasive and expensive investigations to exclude underlying malignancy. In most cases no abnormality is found. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to explore the role of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and their regulatory cytokine IL-15 in irregular bleeding in HT users. DESIGN: This was a prospective observational study conducted between 2002 and 2004. SETTING: The study was conducted in a tertiary referral menopause clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Western Australia. PATIENTS: Patients included 117 postmenopausal women taking combined HT. INTERVENTIONS: Outpatient endometrial biopsies were taken during and outside bleeding episodes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between endometrial uNK cells (CD56+) and bleeding patterns was measured. We also addressed the impact of HT exposure on uNK cell populations, the relationship between endometrial IL-15 expression and uNK cell populations, and killer Ig like receptor genotype in subjects with irregular bleeding. RESULTS: Endometrial CD56+ uNK cells were significantly increased in biopsies obtained during bleeding episodes (P < 0.001), compared with HT users with no bleeding. The highest level of IL-15 expression was also seen in biopsies taken during bleeding. No clear relationship between killer Ig like receptor genotype and bleeding on HT was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Little is known about the mechanisms underlying irregular bleeding in HT users. This is the first report of uNK cells and their association with regulating cytokines in postmenopausal endometrium and demonstrates a possible mechanism by which HT may induce irregular bleeding."]}
{"question": "Can the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp predict a neoplastic polyp?", "retrieved_passages": ["GOALS: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the growth rate of a gallbladder (GB) polyp is a predictive indicator for neoplastic polyps. BACKGROUND: Cholecystectomy for GB polyps that are larger than 10 mm is generally recommended because of the high probability of neoplasm. In contrast, a follow-up strategy is preferred for GB polyps smaller than 10 mm. However, there are no treatment guidelines for polyps that grow in size during the follow-up period. STUDY: We retrospectively investigated 145 patients with GB polyps who underwent at least 1 ultrasonographic follow-up examination over an interval greater than 6 months, before cholecystectomy at Samsung medical center, South Korea, from 1994 to 2007. The growth rate was determined based on the change in size per time interval between 2 ultrasonographic examinations (mm/mo). RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 48 years (range: 25 to 75). One hundred twenty-five non-neoplastic polyps and 20 neoplastic polyps were found. Neoplastic polyps were more frequently found in patients older than 60 years, those with hypertension, a polyp size greater than 10 mm, and a rapid growth rate greater than 0.6 mm/mo. On multivariate analysis, however, the growth rate was not related to the neoplastic nature of a polyp, but older age (>60 y) and large size (>10 mm) were significantly associated with neoplastic polyps. CONCLUSIONS: Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "BACKGROUND: The size of gallbladder (GB) polyps is a representative risk factor for neoplastic polyps. However, whether growth rate during follow-up is associated with neoplastic polyps remains unclear. METHODS: From 2009 to 2019, a cohort of patients with GB polyps who underwent cholecystectomy was enrolled. We included only patients who underwent at least two abdominal ultrasonography procedures at least 6 months apart prior to cholecystectomy. Performance and optimal cutoff value of polyp growth rate for predicting neoplastic polyps were estimated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. In addition to growth rate, several other variables considered suitable for predicting neoplastic polyps were also investigated. A nomogram was created to predict neoplastic polyps. RESULTS: A total of 239 patients with neoplastic polyps (n = 27, 11.3%) and non-neoplastic polyps (n = 212, 88.7%) were included. The median follow-up period was 28.5 months. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of polyp growth rate for neoplastic polyps was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.72). The growth rate cutoff value for prediction of neoplastic polyps was 3 mm/year (sensitivity, 37.0%; specificity, 86.3%). Multivariate analysis identified several factors predicting neoplastic polyps: polyp size >/=10 mm (odds ratio [OR], 3.74, p = 0.041), solitary polyp (OR, 3.92, p = 0.004), and polyp growth rate >/= 3 mm/year (OR, 2.75, p = 0.031). The AUROC of the nomogram using these three significant factors in multivariate analysis was 0.71. CONCLUSION: GB polyps with a growth rate of over 3 mm per year on ultrasonography during follow-up should be considered a risk factor for neoplastic polyps.", "BACKGROUND: Polypoid lesions of the gallbladder (PLG) have been a common finding on ultrasound examinations of the abdomen and are more prevalent since our use of equipment incorporating pulse shaping increased bandwidth, and enhanced phase use for image reconstruction began in 1996. Our study correlates the pre-operative ultrasonographic findings of these lesions to the surgically resected specimen with specific regard to identifying neoplastic polyps. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 130 patients who had a pre-operative ultrasound of the gallbladder and subsequently underwent cholecystectomy between August 1996 and July 2007 at the Mayo Clinic Rochester. RESULTS: Seventy-nine pseudopolyps (cholesterol polyps, inflammatory polyps, and adenomyomas) and 15 neoplastic polyps were identified on histopathologic analysis. However, 36 patients (27%) did not have a PLG upon histopathologic analysis. Thirty-one polyps had suspicious ultrasonographic characteristics for neoplastic changes. Twenty-nine were > or = 10 mm, 12 had vascularity, and one demonstrated invasion. Of these, there were 23 pseudopolyps and six true polyps with neoplastic changes on final pathology (four dysplastic adenomas and two adenocarcinomas). Three asymptomatic polyps < or = 10 mm (4%) in maximum diameter based on pre-operative ultrasound imaging (US) had neoplastic changes at pathology (two dysplastic adenomas and one adenocarcinoma). Several statistically significant risk factors were identified that increased the likelihood for malignancy in a PLG: history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), local invasion, vascularity, and > or = 6 mm maximum diameter based on pre-operative US. Of PLGs < or = 10 mm, 7.4% were neoplastic. Twenty-five patients were followed up with at least two serial ultrasound examinations. Of these, seven demonstrated polyp growth. None of these specimens demonstrated neoplastic changes. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for ultrasound diagnosing neoplastic changes based on current criteria was 28.5% and 93.1%, respectively, with a false negative rate of 5.0%. Expanding the criteria to include cholecystectomy for PLGs > or = 6 mm changes the positive predictive value and negative predictive value to 18.5% and 100%, respectively, with a false negative rate of 0%. CONCLUSION: Histopathologic analysis of polypoid lesions of the gallbladder continues to be the gold standard to identify malignancy. Ultrasound has been used extensively in the pre-operative management of these lesions, but modern ultrasound techniques are unable to differentiate between benign and malignant PLGs with any certainty. We recommend that strong consideration be given to surgical resection of PLGs > or = 6 mm based on pre-operative US due to the significant risk of neoplasm. Additionally, PLGs in all patients with PSC, any patient in whom diligent long-term follow-up cannot be completed, and lesions that demonstrate growth, vascularity, invasion, or are symptomatic require cholecystectomy."]}
{"question": "Are performance measurement systems useful?", "retrieved_passages": ["General Systems Performance Theory (GSPT) was initially motivated by problems associated with quantifying different aspects of human performance. It has proved to be invaluable for measurement development and understanding quantitative relationships between human subsystem capacities and performance in complex tasks. It is now desired to bring focus to the application of GSPT to modeling of cognitive system performance. Previous studies involving two complex tasks (i.e., driving and performing laparoscopic surgery) and incorporating measures that are clearly related to cognitive performance (information processing speed and short-term memory capacity) were revisited. A GSPT-derived method of task analysis and performance prediction termed Nonlinear Causal Resource Analysis (NCRA) was employed to determine the demand on basic cognitive performance resources required to support different levels of complex task performance. This approach is presented as a means to determine a cognitive workload profile and the subsequent computation of a single number measure of cognitive workload (CW). Computation of CW may be a viable alternative to measuring it. Various possible \"more basic\" performance resources that contribute to cognitive system performance are discussed. It is concluded from this preliminary exploration that a GSPT-based approach can contribute to defining cognitive performance models that are useful for both individual subjects and specific groups (e.g., military pilots).", "INTRODUCTION: Whether the focus of population-health improvement efforts, the measurement of health outcomes, risk factors, and interventions to improve them are central to achieving collective impact in the population health perspective. And because of the importance of a shared measurement system, appropriate measures can help to ensure the accountability of and ultimately integrate the efforts of public health, the health care delivery sector, and other public and private entities in the community to improve population health. Yet despite its importance, population health measurement efforts in the United States are poorly developed and uncoordinated. COLLABORATIVE MEASUREMENT DEVELOPMENT: To achieve the potential of the population health perspective, public health officials, health system leaders, and others must work together to develop sets of population health measures that are suitable for different purposes yet are harmonized so that together they can help to improve a community's health. This begins with clearly defining the purpose of a set of measures, distinguishing between outcomes for which all share responsibility and actions to improve health for which the health care sector, public health agencies, and others should be held accountable. FRAMEWORK FOR POPULATION HEALTH MEASUREMENT: Depending on the purpose of the analysis, then, measurement systems should clearly specify what to measure-in particular the population served (the denominator), what the critical health dimensions are in a measurement framework, and how the measures can be used to ensure accountability. Building on a clear understanding of the purpose and dimensions of population health that must be measured, developers can then choose specific measures using existing data or developing new data sources if necessary, with established validity, reliability, and other scientific characteristics. Rather than indiscriminately choosing among the proliferating data streams, this systematic approach to measure development can yield measurement systems that are more appropriate and useful for improving population health.", "The DIN 92419 defines six principles for assistive systems' ergonomic design. There is, however, a lack of measurement tools to evaluate assistive systems considering these principles. Consequently, this study developed a measurement tool for the quantitative evaluation of the fulfilment of each principle for assistive systems. A systematic literature review was performed to identify dimensions belonging to the principles, identify how previous research evaluated these dimensions, and develop a measurement tool for assistive systems. Findings show that scales commonly used for evaluating assistive systems disregard several aspects highlighted as relevant by research, implying the need for considering the DIN 92419 principles. Based on established scales and theoretical findings, a questionnaire, and a checklist for evaluating assistive systems were developed. The work provides a grounding for measuring relevant aspects of assistive systems. Further development is needed to substantiate the reliability and validity of the proposed questionnaire scales and items. Practitioner Summary: Responding to the gap of a holistic measurement tool to evaluate assistive systems, a systematic literature review was performed considering the DIN 92419 principles. This resulted in a comprehensive summary of relevant aspects of assistive systems that were made numerically measurable, which proposes better criteria to assess assistive systems.

Current patient-reported outcome measurements of function fall short for many reasons. This study evaluates the responsiveness of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cancer Function Brief 3D Profile, a novel measure of function across multiple domains. METHODS: Two hundred nine participants across five geographically distinct tertiary care centers completed the assessment and pain rating at two outpatient cancer rehabilitation clinic visits. Patients and providers completed a global rating of change measure at the second visit to indicate whether the patient was improving or worsening in function. Multiple response indices and linear models measured whether the measure was responsive to self-reported and clinician-rated changes over time. Correlations between changes in function and changes in anchors (pain rating and performance status) were also calculated. RESULTS: Function as measured by the PROMIS Cancer Function Brief 3D Profile changed appropriately as both patients and clinicians rated change. Small to moderate effect sizes supported the tool's responsiveness. Function was moderately correlated with pain and more strongly correlated with performance status, and changes in function corresponded with changes in anchor variables. No floor/ceiling effect was found. CONCLUSIONS: The PROMIS Cancer Function Brief 3D Profile is sensitive to changes over time in patients with cancer. The measure may be useful in clinical practice and as an end point in clinical trials. LAY SUMMARY: We gave patients a questionnaire by which they told their physicians how well they were functioning, including how fatigued they were. This study tested that questionnaire to see whether the scores would change if patients got better or worse.", "Performance claims are the vehicle by which a manufacturer communicates the analytic capabilities of its methods to laboratory users and to regulatory agencies. Claims describe the expected performance of an analytic system. To be useful, claims must be meaningful, achievable, and verifiable. To ensure consistent interpretation, they must be stated in clear, unambiguous terms. There are no specific guidelines for stating claims. Consequently, comparing the performance of one system to another is difficult. Claims fall into three categories: clinical utility, analytical performance, and boundary conditions. This article focuses on the three basic analytical performance characteristics, precision, accuracy, and specificity, and describes how they are established, validated, maintained, and monitored by manufacturers and how they can be verified by end users. Precision claims describe the inherent variability of the system. They differ in the components of variance included, ranging from the short-term variables within a single run to the long-term variables experienced over time, such as lot changes, calibrations, instrument drift, and environmental fluctuations. Precision may be stated either as typical user experience or as the minimum performance expected. Accuracy claims describe the degree to which the results will approximate the true values. They are more difficult to establish and verify, given the lack of objective standards for many analytes. For this reason, few manufacturers make true accuracy claims, relying instead on comparisons with other marketed methods. A notable exception is cholesterol, for which a model reference system has been established to help laboratories ensure accuracy. External proficiency testing is handicapped by matrix effects from imperfect survey fluids. Specificity claims describe the method's freedom from interference and cross-reactivity. They are based on screening tests by the manufacturer, augmented by feedback from users. There are no agreed-on criteria for what constitutes clinically significant interference, and no consistent approach for disclosing interference information. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Villanova, Pa, is beginning to develop guidelines to promote greater consistency in performance claim statements."]}
{"question": "Does para-cervical block offer additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester?", "retrieved_passages": ["Uterus-specific synthetic Prostaglandin analogues (gemeprost, sulproston etc.) have been widely employed for termination of pregnancy in the second trimester. Since paracervical anaesthesia may be useful during this procedure, we investigated in this prospective randomised study its impact on the clinical course of abortion and pain especially in the late first and second stage of labour. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 women scheduled for elective abortion (fetal reasons) between the 16th and 23rd week of gestation were to be given 1 mg gemeprost vaginally every 6 hours. They were allocated at random: 10 women received only Pethidin intravenously and Butylscopolamine rectally, another 10 women were additionally treated by paracervical anaesthesia (2 x 10 ml 0.5% Bupivacain solution) at a cervical dilatation of 2-3 cm. RESULTS: A median of 3 gemeprost applications were administered in both groups. In the group without paracervical anaesthesia the median induction to abortion interval was 20 hours (range: 8-44 hours), 13 hours (range: 8-36 hours, NS) resulting for the paracervical anaesthesia group. The intervals from the last application of prostaglandin until abortion and from 3 cm cervical dilatation to abortion were slightly, but not significantly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group. The requirement of Butylscopolamine was higher in the latter group (p < 0.05). The requirement of Pethidin and the intensity of pain (measured by pain scale according to Huskisson) especially in the late first stage of labour were not statistically different between both groups. Side effects of paracervical anaesthesia did not occur. CONCLUSION: Paracervical anaesthesia is a method for analgesia during second trimester abortion with a low rate of side effects. It can shorten the duration of last period of second trimester abortion in some cases but has no impact on the perception of pain nor requirement of analgesics and so with only limited benefit in second trimester abortion with vaginal gemeprost."]}
{"question": "Does insulin resistance drive the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown associations between hyperglycemia and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, yet glucose-lowering treatment does little to mitigate this risk. We examined whether associations between hyperglycemia and CVD risk were explained by underlying insulin resistance. METHODS: In 60 middle-aged individuals without diabetes we studied the associations of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour post oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity as well as body fat percentage with CVD risk. Insulin sensitivity was measured as the glucose infusion rate during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, body fat percentage was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry, and CVD risk was estimated using the Framingham risk score. Associations of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity and body fat percentage with the Framingham risk score were assessed in linear regression models. RESULTS: Both fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose levels were associated with higher Framingham risk score (fasting glucose: r(2) = 0.21; 2-hour glucose: r(2) = 0.24; P<0.001 for both), and insulin sensitivity with lower Framingham risk score (r(2) = 0.36; P<0.001). However, adjustment for insulin sensitivity and 2-hour glucose made the effect of fasting glucose non-significant (P = 0.060). Likewise, when adjusting for insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose, the association between 2-hour glucose and Framingham risk score disappeared (P = 0.143). In contrast, insulin sensitivity was still associated with Framingham risk score after adjusting for glucose levels (P<0.001). Body fat was not associated with Framingham risk score when taking insulin sensitivity into account (P = 0.550). CONCLUSION: The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "Despite criticism regarding its clinical relevance, the concept of the metabolic syndrome improves our understanding of both the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and its associated metabolic changes and vascular consequences. Free fatty acids (FFA) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) play prominent roles in the development of insulin resistance by impairing the intracellular insulin signalling transduction pathway. Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and strongly related to insulin resistance. In case of obesity, FFAs and TNF-alpha are produced in abundance by adipocytes, whereas the production of adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, is reduced. This imbalanced production of pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines, as observed in adipocyte dysfunction, is thought to be the driving force behind insulin resistance. The role of several recently discovered adipokines such as resistin, visfatin and retinol-binding protein (RBP)-4 in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance is increasingly understood. Insulin resistance induces several metabolic changes, including hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and hypertension, all leading to increased cardiovascular risk. In addition, the dysfunctional adipocyte, reflected largely by low adiponectin levels and a high TNF-alpha concentration, directly influences the vascular endothelium, causing endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Adipocyte dysfunction could therefore be regarded as the common antecedent of both insulin resistance and atherosclerosis and functions as the link between obesity and cardiovascular disease. Targeting the dysfunctional adipocyte may reduce the risk for both cardiovascular disease and the development of type 2 diabetes. Although lifestyle intervention remains the cornerstone of therapy in improving insulin sensitivity and its associated metabolic changes, medical treatment might prove to be important as well.", "Diabetes is associated with an increased mortality risk due to cardiovascular complications. Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress underlies these complications, leading to an impairment in endogenous nitric oxide (NO*) generation, together with reductions in NO* bioavailability and NO* responsiveness in the vasculature, platelets and myocardium. The latter impairment of responsiveness to NO*, termed NO* resistance, compromises the ability of traditional NO*-based therapeutics to improve hemodynamic status during diabetes-associated cardiovascular emergencies, such as acute myocardial infarction. Whilst a number of agents can ameliorate (e.g. angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, perhexiline, statins and insulin) or circumvent (e.g. nitrite and sGC activators) NO* resistance, nitroxyl (HNO) donors offer a novel opportunity to circumvent NO* resistance in diabetes. With a suite of vasoprotective properties and an ability to enhance cardiac inotropic and lusitropic responses, coupled with preserved efficacy in the setting of oxidative stress, HNO donors have intact therapeutic potential in the face of diminished NO* signaling. This review explores the major mechanisms by which hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress drives NO* resistance, and the therapeutic potential of HNO donors to circumvent this to treat cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus.", "The body's resistance to the actions of insulin (type II diabetes defect) results in compensatory increased production and secretion by the pancreas and leads to hyperinsulinemia in order to maintain euglycemia. When insulin secretion cannot be increased adequately (type I diabetes defect) to overcome insulin resistance in maintaining glucose homeostasis, hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance ensues. Insulin resistance and glucose intolerance has been well recognized in patients with advanced chronic kidney diseases (CKD). The etiology may involve uremic toxins from protein catabolism, vitamin D deficiency, metabolic acidosis, anemia, poor physical fitness, inflammation, and cachexia. Glucose and insulin abnormalities in nondiabetic CKD patients are implicated in the pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and may represent important risk factors for accelerated atherosclerosis in these patients. Insulin secretion inadequacy has been associated with growth retardation in adolescents with CKD. Normal adolescents demonstrate an increase in insulin secretion as they go into puberty. It seems that the puberty growth spurt in adolescents both with normal health and renal failure may require increased insulin secretion as one of its hormonal requirements. Finally, insulin resistance has been associated with CKD. Whether insulin resistance is an antecedent of CKD or a consequence of impaired kidney function has been a subject of debate. The goal of this review was to provide an update of the literature on insulin pathophysiology in CKD, current understanding of its mechanisms, and epidemiological association of insulin resistance and CKD.", "AIMS: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is an acute heart failure (AHF) syndrome mimicking the symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. Impaired outcome has been shown, making risk stratification and novel therapeutic concepts a necessity. We hypothesized insulin resistance with elevated plasma glucose and potentially myocardial glucose deprivation to contribute to the pathogenesis of TTS and investigated the therapeutic benefit of insulin in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: First, we retrospectively analysed patient data of n = 265 TTS cases (85.7% female, mean age 71.1 +/- 14.1 years) with documented initial plasma glucose from the Department of Cardiology of the University Hospital Heidelberg in Germany (May 2011 to May 2021). Median split of the study population according to glucose levels (</=123 mg/dL vs. >123 mg/dL) yielded significantly elevated mean heart rate (80.75 +/- 18.96 vs. 90.01 +/- 22.19 b.p.m., P < 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP, 18.51 +/- 8.35 vs. 23.09 +/- 7.97 mmHg, P < 0.001), C-reactive protein (26.14 +/- 43.30 vs. 46.4 +/- 68.6 mg/L, P = 0.006), leukocyte count (10.12 +/- 4.29 vs. 15.05 +/- 9.83/nL, P < 0.001), peak high-sensitive Troponin T (hs-TnT, 515.44 +/- 672.15 vs. 711.40 +/- 736.37 pg/mL, P = 0.005), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF, 34.92 +/- 8.94 vs. 31.35 +/- 8.06%, P < 0.001), and elevated intrahospital mortality (2.3% vs. 12.1%, P = 0.002) in the high-glucose group (Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or chi-squared test). Linear regression indicated a significant association of glucose with HR (P < 0.001), LVEDP (P = 0.014), hs-TnT kinetics from admission to the next day (P < 0.001), hs-TnT the day after admission (P < 0.001), as well as peak hsTnT (P < 0.001). Logistic regression revealed significant association of glucose with a composite intrahospital outcome including catecholamine use, respiratory support, and resuscitation [OR 1.010 (1.004-1.015), P = 0.001]. To further investigate the potential role of glucose in TTS pathophysiology experimentally, we utilized an in vivo murine model of epinephrine (EPI)-driven reversible AHF. For this, male mice underwent therapeutic injection of insulin (INS, 1 IU/kg) or/and glucose (GLU, 0.5 g/kg) after EPI (2.5 mg/kg), both of which markedly improved mean EF (EPI 34.3% vs. EPI + INS + GLU 43.7%, P = 0.025) and significantly blunted mean hs-TnT (EPI 14 393 pg/mL vs. EPI + INS 6864 pg/mL at 24 h, P = 0.039). Particularly, insulin additionally ameliorated myocardial pro-inflammatory gene expression, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of acute insulin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated initial plasma glucose was associated with adverse outcome-relevant parameters in TTS and may present a surrogate parameter of heightened catecholaminergic drive. In mice, insulin- and glucose injection both improved EPI-induced AHF and myocardial damage, indicating insulin resistance rather than detrimental effects of hyperglycaemia itself as the underlying cause. Future studies will investigate the role of HbA1c as a risk stratifier and of insulin-based therapy in TTS."]}
{"question": "Does successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme result in improved obstetric practice?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To determine whether successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme (PEP) improves obstetric practice. METHOD: The three midwife obstetric units (MOUs) in a health district of Mpumalanga were included in the study. Two MOUs enrolled in the PEP and the third did not. A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered. OUTCOME MEASURES: We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed. RESULTS: Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. CONCLUSION: Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.", "AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the success of a competency-based nursing orientation programme for a single-room maternity care unit by measuring improvement in self-reported competency after six months. BACKGROUND: Single-room maternity care has challenged obstetrical nurses to provide comprehensive nursing care during all phases of the in-hospital birth experience. In this model, nurses provide intrapartum, postpartum and newborn care in one room. To date, an evaluation of nursing education for single-room maternity care has not been published. DESIGN: A prospective cohort design comparing self-reported competencies prior to starting work in the single-room maternity care and six months after. METHODS: Nurses completed a competency-based education programme in which they could select from a menu of learning methods and content areas according to their individual needs. Learning methods included classroom lectures, self-paced learning packages, and preceptorships in the clinical area. Competencies were measured by a standardized perinatal self-efficacy tool and a tool developed by the authors for this study, the Single-Room Maternity Care Competency Tool. A paired analysis was undertaken to take into account the paired (before and after) nature of the design. RESULTS: Scores on the perinatal self-efficacy scale and the single-room maternity care competency tool were improved. These differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in perinatal and single-room maternity care-specific competencies suggest that our education programme was successful in preparing nurses for their new role in the single-room maternity care setting. This conclusion is supported by reported increases in nursing and patient satisfaction in the single-room maternity care compared with the traditional labour/delivery and postpartum settings. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: An education programme tailored to the learning needs of experienced clinical nurses contributes to improvements in nursing competencies and patient care."]}
{"question": "Does reducing spasticity translate into functional benefit?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Spasticity and loss of function in an affected arm are common after stroke. Although botulinum toxin is used to reduce spasticity, its functional benefits are less easily demonstrated. This paper reports an exploratory meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between reduced arm spasticity and improved arm function. METHOD: Individual data from stroke patients in two randomised controlled trials of intra-muscular botulinum toxin were pooled. The Modified Ashworth Scale (elbow, wrist, fingers) was used to calculate a \"Composite Spasticity Index\". Data from the arm section of the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (dressing, grooming, and feeding) and three subjective measures (putting arm through sleeve, cleaning palm, cutting fingernails) were summed to give a \"Composite Functional Index\". Change scores and the time of maximum change were also calculated. RESULTS: Maximum changes in both composite measures occurred concurrently in 47 patients. In 26 patients the improvement in spasticity preceded the improvement in function with 18 showing the reverse. There was a definite relationship between the maximum change in spasticity and the maximum change in arm function, independent of treatment (rho = -0.2822, p = 0.0008, n = 137). There was a clear relationship between the changes in spasticity and in arm function in patients treated with botulinum toxin (Dysport) at 500 or 1000 units (rho = -0.5679, p = 0.0090, n = 22; rho = -0.4430, p = 0.0018, n = 47), but not in those treated with placebo or 1500 units. CONCLUSIONS: Using a targeted meta-analytic approach, it is possible to demonstrate that reducing spasticity in the arm is associated with a significant improvement in arm function.", "OBJECTIVE: Botulinum toxin is known to relieve upper limb spasticity, which is a disabling complication of stroke. We examined its effect on quality of life and other person-centred perspectives. DESIGN: A multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. PATIENTS: Ninety-six patients were randomized (mean age 59.5 years) at least 6 months post-stroke. Mean time since stroke was 5.9 years. METHODS: Patients received either botulinum toxin type A or placebo into the affected distal upper limb muscles on 2 occasions, 12 weeks apart. Assessment was undertaken at baseline, 8, 12, 20 and 24 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Assessment of Quality of Life scale (AQoL). Secondary outcome assessments included Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), pain, mood, global benefit, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), disability and carer burden. RESULTS: The groups did not differ significantly with respect to quality of life, pain, mood, disability or carer burden. However, patients treated with botulinum toxin type A had significantly greater reduction in spasticity (MAS) (p < 0.001), which translated into higher GAS scores (p < 0.01) and greater global benefit (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Although no change in quality of life was demonstrated using the AQoL, botulinum toxin type A was found to be safe and efficacious in reducing upper limb spasticity and improving the ability to achieve personal goals.", "IMPORTANCE: There is a revived interest to explore spinal cord epidural stimulation (SCES) to improve physical function after spinal cord injury (SCI). This case report highlights the potential of eliciting multiple functional improvements with a single SCES configuration, a strategy which could improve clinical translation. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether SCES intended to facilitate walking also acutely yields benefits in cardiovascular autonomic regulation and spasticity. DESIGN: Case report from data collected at two timepoints 15 weeks apart from March to June 2022 as part of a larger clinical trial. SETTING: Research lab at Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center. PARTICIPANT: 27-year-old male, 7 years post a C8 motor complete spinal cord injury. INTERVENTION: A SCES configuration intended to enhance exoskeleton-assisted walking training applied for autonomic and spasticity management. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was cardiovascular autonomic response to a 45-degree head-up-tilt test. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), and absolute power of the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) components of a heart-rate variability analysis were collected in supine and tilt with and without the presence of SCES. Right knee flexor and knee extensor spasticity was assessed via isokinetic dynamometry with and without SCES. RESULTS: At both assessments with SCES off, transitioning from supine to tilt decreased SBP (assessment one: 101.8 to 70 mmHg; assessment two: 98.9 to 66.4 mmHg). At assessment one, SCES on in supine (3 mA) increased SBP (average 117 mmHg); in tilt, 5 mA stabilized SBP near baseline values (average 111.5 mmHg). At assessment two, SCES on in supine (3 mA) increased SBP (average 140 mmHg in minute one); decreasing amplitude to 2 mA decreased SBP (average 119 mmHg in minute five). In tilt, 3 mA stabilized SBP near baseline values (average 93.2 mmHg). Torque-time integrals at the right knee were reduced at all angular velocities for knee flexors (range: -1.9 to -7.8%) and knee extensors (range: -1 to -11.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results demonstrate that SCES intended to facilitate walking may also enhance cardiovascular autonomic control and attenuate spasticity. Using one configuration to enhance multiple functions after SCI may accelerate clinical translation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/, identifier NCT04782947.", "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Spasticity in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) is difficult to manage. Exercise and stretching is advocated as a management tool, but these activities are difficult to perform for most patients as a result of multiple barriers. This report shows the effect of passive range-of-motion exercise in a walking-like pattern on frequency-dependent habituation of the H-reflex in the lower extremities of an individual with spastic tetraplegia due to SCI. METHODS: The participant, a man with a chronic ASIA B C7 SCI due to a gunshot wound, used a motorized bicycle exercise trainer (MBET) developed at the Jackson T. Stephens Spine & Neurosciences Institute at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences that could be operated from the individual's wheelchair. He used the MBET for 1 hour, 5 days a week, for 13 weeks. H-reflex habituation was tested at the beginning of the study and then periodically over the course of 17 weeks, including 4 weeks after exercise had ceased. RESULTS: Significant habituation of the H-reflex was evident beginning at the 10th week of training. The habituation in the H-reflex reached a normal level at 5- and 10-Hz frequencies at 12 weeks. Subjective assessment of spasticity indicated that it was significantly reduced. The H-reflex amplitude was maintained at normal levels during the remaining week of the course of exercise and for 2 additional weeks after exercise ceased. The H-reflex habituation, however, returned to near baseline when reassessed at week 17, 4 weeks after the exercise program had concluded. Subjective assessment indicated that spasticity also had returned to pretraining levels. CONCLUSIONS: Habituation of the H-reflex, and perhaps spasticity, can be managed by a routine passive range-of-motion exercise program using a MBET, but the exercise program may need to be continuous. The benefit of reduced medication for spasticity and possibly improved quality of life could be a motivating factor for an individual with SCI and spasticity to continue the program. Because of the low complexity of the program, ease of use, and small size, this system could be inexpensive and could be used by an individual in the home. Ongoing studies will determine the minimum amount of MBET training required for maintaining long-term H-reflex habituation.", "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating disorder, which produces profound deficits in volitional motor control. Following medical stabilization, recovery from SCI typically involves long term rehabilitation. While recovery of walking ability is a primary goal in many patients early after injury, those with a motor incomplete SCI, indicating partial preservation of volitional control, may have the sufficient residual descending pathways necessary to attain this goal. However, despite physical interventions, motor impairments including weakness, and the manifestation of abnormal involuntary reflex activity, called spasticity or spasms, are thought to contribute to reduced walking recovery. Doctrinaire thought suggests that remediation of this abnormal motor reflexes associated with SCI will produce functional benefits to the patient. For example, physicians and therapists will provide specific pharmacological or physical interventions directed towards reducing spasticity or spasms, although there continues to be little empirical data suggesting that these strategies improve walking ability. In the past few decades, accumulating data has suggested that specific neuromodulatory agents, including agents which mimic or facilitate the actions of the monoamines, including serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE), can initiate or augment walking behaviors in animal models of SCI. Interestingly, many of these agents, particularly 5HTergic agonists, can markedly increase spinal excitability, which in turn also increases reflex activity in these animals. Counterintuitive to traditional theories of recovery following human SCI, the empirical evidence from basic science experiments suggest that this reflex hyper excitability and generation of locomotor behaviors are driven in parallel by neuromodulatory inputs (5HT) and may be necessary for functional recovery following SCI. The application of this novel concept derived from basic scientific studies to promote recovery following human SCI would appear to be seamless, although the direct translation of the findings can be extremely challenging. Specifically, in the animal models, an implanted catheter facilitates delivery of very specific 5HT agonist compounds directly onto the spinal circuitry. The translation of this technique to humans is hindered by the lack of specific surgical techniques or available pharmacological agents directed towards 5HT receptor subtypes that are safe and effective for human clinical trials. However, oral administration of commonly available 5HTergic agents, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be a viable option to increase central 5HT concentrations in order to facilitate walking recovery in humans. Systematic quantification of how these SSRIs modulate human motor behaviors following SCI, with a specific focus on strength, reflexes, and the recovery of walking ability, are missing. This video demonstration is a progressive attempt to systematically and quantitatively assess the modulation of reflex activity, volitional strength and ambulation following the acute oral administration of an SSRI in human SCI. Agents are applied on single days to assess the immediate effects on motor function in this patient population, with long-term studies involving repeated drug administration combined with intensive physical interventions."]}
{"question": "Does the bracket-ligature combination affect the amount of orthodontic space closure over three months?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of bracket-ligature combination on the amount of orthodontic space closure over three months. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial with three parallel groups. SETTING: A hospital orthodontic department (Chesterfield Royal Hospital, UK). PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients requiring upper first premolar extractions. METHODS: Informed consent was obtained and participants were randomly allocated into one of three groups: (1) conventional pre-adjusted edgewise brackets and elastomeric ligatures; (2) conventional pre-adjusted edgewise brackets and Super Slick((R)) low friction elastomeric ligatures; (3) Damon 3MX((R)) passive self-ligating brackets. Space closure was undertaken on 0.019x0.025-inch stainless steel archwires with nickel-titanium coil springs. Participants were recalled at four weekly intervals. Upper alginate impressions were taken at each visit (maximum three). The primary outcome measure was the mean amount of space closure in a 3-month period. RESULTS: A one-way ANOVA was undertaken [dependent variable: mean space closure (mm); independent variable: group allocation]. The amount of space closure was very similar between the three groups (1 mm per 28 days); however, there was a wide variation in the rate of space closure between individuals. The differences in the amount of space closure over three months between the three groups was very small and non-significant (P = 0.718). CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that reducing friction by modifying the bracket/ligature interface increases the rate of space closure was not supported. The major determinant of orthodontic tooth movement is probably the individual patient response."]}

This study evaluated the health practices and the vaccination status of first year residents working at the academic hospital Hotel-Dieu de France. METHODS: The medical files of all medicine and surgery residents in their first year of specialization between the years 2005 and 2008 were reviewed. These residents were required to go through a preventive medical visit at the University Center of Family and Community Health. RESULTS: One hundred and nine residents (109) were included in the study; 68 (6239%) were male and 41 (37.61%) were female with a mean age of 26 years. Only 6 residents (5.50%) practiced physical activity according to international guidelines (more than three times a week for more than 30 minutes each time). Most residents (n = 76 ; 69.73%) used to skip one or two meals especially breakfast and as a consequence 30 male (44.11%) and 4 female (9.75%) students were overweight, with a statistical difference between the two sexes (Fisher test, p-value = 0.001). Twenty-eight residents (25.69%) were smokers with a male predominance. Fourteen residents of both genders (12.84%) drank alcohol regularly (> 3 times a week) and 71 (65.14%) had a drink occasionally (once a month or less). Only 25 residents (23%) of the cohort had a complete and up-to-date immunization status. The immunization gap was basically against measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis (dT Polio). Ninety-nine residents (90.83%) had full immunization against hepatitis B with an adequate response in 78 residents (71.56%). CONCLUSION: This study showed that our residents did not always have a healthy lifestyle especially when it comes to physical activity and eating habits. They also lacked an adequate vaccination. Interventions should take place in order to promote healthy life style and to improve their vaccination status."]}
{"question": "Does vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia have the same evolution as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia is a little known disease which could be related to risk factors different from simple HPV infections. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain wheter vaginal lesions have a natural history similar to cervical lesions. MATERIALS & METHODS: A retrospective study to identify patients with vaginal lesions and synchronous cervical lesions through biopsy. The rate of mild cervical lesions (koilocytosis, warts, CIN I with and without koilocytosis) was compared with the rate of severe cervical lesions (CIN II and III, cervical carcinoma) in patients with mild vaginal lesions (warts and koilocytosis, and low-grade VAIN) and in patients with severe vaginal lesions (high-grade VAIN). Using koilocytosis as a marker, the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was compared with the rate of \"non active\" cervical lesions in patients with \"active\" versus \"non active\" vaginal lesions. Finally, the rates of mild and severe cervical lesions were compared among each group of VAIN (low-grade, high-grade, with or without koilocytosis). RESULTS: In patients with mild vaginal lesions, mild cervical lesions were significantly more frequent than severe cervical lesions. In patients with \"active\" vaginal lesions the rate of \"active\" cervical lesions was significantly higher than \"non active\" cervical lesions. The differences in rates of mild cervical lesions and severe cervical lesions among patients with high-grade VAIN and low-grade VAIN (with and without koilocytosis) were not significant.

Moreover, in cervical and vaginal biopsies from 265 patients, we compared the severity of intraepithelial neoplasia of the vagina and cervix. In our series, vaginal lesions accounted for over half (52.6%) of the alterations attributable to HPV infection, while VAIN accounted for 46.5%; in 84.8% of cases, VAIN was associated with HPV. In 49.8% of cases, biopsies were from the upper third of the vagina and in 74.8% the pathological areas involved both the cervix and the vagina. The DES-like zone accounted for 7.9% of cases, vaginal wall involvement being limited to the upper third. Finally, the comparison of histological findings, in the 265 patients, confirmed that in 69.8% cases vaginal and cervical lesions were of the same grade; in 18.8% vaginal lesions were more severe than cervical lesions. In our study a higher number of vaginal biopsies were taken than in previous years, and it is difficult to establish whether this depends on improved diagnostic methods or on changes in epithemiological factors, such as the reported increase in the incidence of HPV lesions. A systemic search for lesions and a study on their evolution are therefore required to clarify this aspect.", "CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES: Cervical cancer is an important cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. There is some controversy about the factors that may be associated with infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV) that may favor or protect against evolution from a low-grade intraepithelial lesion to a high-grade intraepithelial lesion or invasive neoplasia. The objective here was to evaluate the evolution of low-grade intraepithelial lesions and squamous or glandular lesions of undetermined significance, the associated factors and cytohistological correlations. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective study conducted in a public tertiary-level university hospital. METHODS: Information was obtained by reviewing patient records and/or colposcopy reports. A statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression, calculating the odds ratio and applying chi-square tests. RESULTS: Of the 3390 patients, 409 evolved to high-grade intraepithelial lesions, of which 354 had an initial diagnosis of HPV infection, 27 of squamous atypia of undetermined significance, 22 of low-grade intraepithelial lesions with or without cytological diagnosis of infection by associated HPV and six of glandular cell atypia of undetermined significance. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus sp and bacterial vaginosis on the smears, smoking and immunodepression were factors associated with evolution. A single partner, use of hormonal contraceptives, lower parity, age and a cytological diagnosis of cytolytic vaginosis, T. vaginalis, Candida sp or cocci were factors associated with protection.

Although it is classified as a probably high risk type, the association between HPV 53 and the development of neoplastic cervical disease is unclear, and HPV 53 is known to be genomically diverse. We investigated 15 cases of HPV 53 genital infection in women living in the state of Rio de Janeiro that were not associated with severe intraepithelial cervical neoplasia. To trace HPV 53 variants in this geographic area, we characterized the L1, E6 and E7 genes from these isolates, and undertook a phylogenetic analysis based on multiple alignment of their L1 sequences. After amplification and sequence analysis, we identified seven different L1-E6-E7 variants and a L1 co-infected isolate, which taken together had base pair changes at 29 different positions. The co-infected sample presented overlapped peaks at two positions. We also detected two new E6 genomic variants. Several base pair changes in the E6 region resulted in amino acid changes, three of which were non-conservative. The E7 gene was the most conserved sequence among those studied; in contrast, the E6 sequence reached a maximum difference of 2.79%. None of the HPV 53 isolates corresponded to the reference type. Dichotomical branching characteristic of HPV 53 was observed in all of the trees constructed, as well as in the concatenated phylogenetic tree. Probably, these variants pointing to evolutionary process, but they not appear to keep an increasing of pathogenesis Despite the limited number of samples analyzed in our work, we noticed that the same variant was found in more than one woman. Therefore, it is possible that such variants have been circulating in the female population in the state of Rio de Janeiro for a longer time or that due to host or genetic viral factors, these variants can spread more rapidly than others.", "This paper reports the results of cervico-vaginal examinations performed on the women (7,098) resident in the municipality of Bollate (mass screening) and the women (1,416) hospitalized in the Gynecologic ward in the same period (in-patients).

{"question": "Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients: are marginally acceptable hearts suitable for transplantation?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The brain-dead donor supply has become one of the criteria limiting the performance of heart transplantation. Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible. METHODS: Fifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%. RESULTS: Of the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died: 2 from hemorrhage (FAC > 50% in donors); 1 from right and one from left ventricular dysfunction (FAC < 50% in donors). The FAC increased significantly from 51 +/- 15% to 57 +/- 11% in 18 hearts that underwent TEE in donors and afterwards in recipients. Overall actuarial survival was 86.2% versus 64.6% at 1 and 2 years in group H1 and group H2, respectively (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation."]}

METHODS: We examined the placebo arm of the NINDS t-PA stroke trial to test the hypothesis that the total volume of cerebral infarction in patients with right hemisphere strokes would be greater than the volume of cerebral infarction in patients with left hemisphere strokes who have similar NIHSS scores. The volume of stroke was determined by computerized image analysis of CT films and CT images stored on computer tape and optical disks. Cube-root transformation of lesion volume was performed for each CT. Transformed lesion volume was analyzed in a logistic regression model to predict volume of stroke by NIHSS score for each hemisphere. Spearman rank correlation was used to determine the relation between the NIHSS score and lesion volume. RESULTS: The volume for right hemisphere stroke was statistically greater than the volume for left hemisphere strokes, adjusting for the baseline NIHSS (P<0. 001). For each 5-point category of the NIHSS score <20, the median volume of right hemisphere strokes was approximately double the median volume of left hemisphere strokes. For example, for patients with a left hemisphere stroke and a 24-hour NIHSS score of 16 to 20, the median volume of cerebral infarction was 48 mL (interquartile range 14 to 111 mL) as compared with 133 mL (interquartile range 81 to 208 mL) for patients with a right hemisphere stroke (P<0.001). The median volume of a right hemisphere stroke was roughly equal to the median volume of a left hemisphere stroke in the next highest 5-point category of the NIHSS. The Spearman rank correlation between the 24-hour NIHSS score and 3-month lesion volume was 0.72 for patients with left hemisphere stroke and 0.71 for patients with right hemisphere stroke. CONCLUSIONS: For a given NIHSS score, the median volume of right hemisphere strokes is consistently larger than the median volume of left hemisphere strokes. The clinical implications of our finding need further exploration.", "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The term \"minor stroke\" is often used; however a consensus definition is lacking. We explored the relationship of 6 \"minor stroke\" definitions and outcome and tested their validity in subgroups of patients. METHODS: A total of 760 consecutive patients with acute ischemic strokes were classified according to the following definitions: A, score < or = 1 on every National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) item and normal consciousness; B, lacunar-like syndrome; C, motor deficits with or without sensory deficits; D, NIHSS < or = 9 excluding those with aphasia, neglect, or decreased consciousness; E, NIHSS < or = 9; and F, NIHSS < or = 3. Short-term outcome was considered favorable when patients were discharged home, and favorable medium-term outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of < or = 2 at 3 months. The following subgroup analyses were performed by definition: sex, age, anterior versus posterior and right versus left hemispheric stroke, and early (0 to 6 hours) versus late admission (6 to 24 hours) to the hospital. RESULTS: Short-term and medium-term outcomes were most favorable in patients with definition A (74% and 90%, respectively) and F (71% and 90%, respectively). Patients with definition C and anterior circulation strokes were more likely to be discharged home than patients with posterior circulation strokes (P=0.021). The medium-term outcome of older patients with definition E was less favorable compared with the outcome of younger ones (P=0.001), whereas patients with definition A, D, and F did not show different outcomes in any subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Patients fulfilling definition A and F had best short-term and medium-term outcomes. They would be best suited to the definition of \"minor stroke.\"", "Background and Purpose- Physiological effects of stroke are best assessed over entire brain networks rather than just focally at the site of structural damage. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can map functional-anatomic networks by analyzing spontaneously correlated low-frequency activity fluctuations across the brain, but its potential usefulness in predicting functional outcome after acute stroke remains unknown. We assessed the ability of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to predict functional outcome after acute stroke. Methods- We scanned 37 consecutive reperfused stroke patients (age, 69+/-14 years; 14 females; 3-day National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 6+/-5) on day 3 after symptom onset. After imaging preprocessing, we used a whole-brain mask to calculate the correlation coefficient matrices for every paired region using the Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlas. To evaluate functional outcome, we applied the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. We used region of interest analyses to explore the functional connectivity between regions and graph-computation analysis to detect differences in functional connectivity between patients with good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score </=2) and those with poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score >2). Results- Patients with good outcome had greater functional connectivity than patients with poor outcome. Although 3-day National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was the most accurate independent predictor of 90-day modified Rankin Scale (84.2%), adding functional connectivity increased accuracy to 94.7%. Preserved bilateral interhemispheric connectivity between the anterior inferior temporal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus and decreased connectivity between the caudate and anterior inferior temporal gyrus in the left hemisphere had the greatest impact in favoring good prognosis. Conclusions- These data suggest that information about functional connectivity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging may help predict 90-day stroke outcome.", "Older patients with stroke have poor functional prognosis compared to younger patients. Patients with stroke who have severe white matter (WM) lesions have been reported to have poor functional prognosis such as cognitive dysfunction, increased propensity for falling, and gait and balance problems. The aim of this study was to determine whether WM lesions exert negative effects on swallowing function in older patients with mild stroke. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 63 patients aged >65 years who had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score </=5 and who underwent videofluoroscopic swallowing examination after their first stroke. Linear regression analysis showed that oral transit time tended to increase as Fazekas grade increased (p = 0.003). In addition, inadequate mastication was related to the presence of lesions in the left hemisphere (p = 0.039). The presence of penetration could also be predicted by Fazekas grade (p = 0.015). Our findings suggest that WM lesions observed in brain magnetic resonance imaging scans can impact swallowing problems in older patients with mild stroke, regardless of initial stroke severity or other factors associated with lesion location. Accordingly, our data indicate that WM lesions are a predictive factor by which patients can be stratified into favorable or unfavorable outcomes with respect to dysphagia.", "BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic therapy is frequently withheld in patients with minor stroke symptoms. However, recent studies demonstrate that a substantial proportion of these patients dies or remains permanently disabled because of underestimation of symptom severity at baseline or secondary deterioration. We aimed to assess the safety and outcome of thrombolysis therapy in patients with minor but disabling stroke symptoms. METHODS: 32 patients presenting with mild symptoms were treated with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator between April 2006 and April 2008. Data were extracted from a prospectively collected database. Baseline demographic data, and clinical, laboratory and imaging findings were analyzed. Outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 3 months and was dichotomized into favorable (mRS 0-1) versus unfavorable (mRS 2-6). RESULTS: In the majority of patients, the left hemisphere was affected, with aphasia representing the most common symptom leading to treatment decision. The frequency of perfusion lesion (46%) and vessel occlusion (35%) at baseline was high but had no effect on the outcome at 3 months in our series of treated patients. Outcome was favorable in 94% of patients, and 47% recovered without any persisting symptom. Only one asymptomatic and no symptomatic hemorrhage was observed. CONCLUSION: Our data support current guidelines and international licenses which give no lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) limit for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Considering the accumulating evidence that the natural course in patients with mild symptoms is not as favorable as often assumed and taking the low risk of bleeding in those patients into account, patients with mild but disabling symptoms should be treated with IVT regardless of their baseline NIHSS score."]}
{"question": "Can a Novel Surgical Approach to the Temporomandibular Joint Improve Access and Reduce Complications?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: This clinical study investigated whether the vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) could improve access and decrease complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective evaluation consisted of a consecutive series of patients who underwent TMJ surgeries through the VMPA from January through December 2013. Patients with a history of TMJ surgery were excluded. Clinical data, including operating times, subjective complaints of incision scars, functional conditions of the auriculotemporal nerve and facial nerve, and other complications, were recorded and analyzed. All patients in this study were followed for at least 6 months. RESULTS: All patients (606 joints) had successful TMJ surgeries through the VMPA. All incisions healed favorably with an uneventful recovery. No patient developed permanent weakness of the facial nerve or other severe complications. CONCLUSION: The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of protecting the facial nerve with a modified endaural approach with a peripheral dissection of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system to access the temporomandibular joint which allows an excellent operative field of visualization, multiple surgical procedures of the temporomandibular joint, and general care which improves the immediate postoperative period, making this a less morbid surgery. This study included 33 patients (39 sides) who underwent surgical treatment for disorders of the temporomandibular joint from the years 2021 to 2023 at the maxillofacial department of the clinic \"Colsanitas\" located in Bogota, Colombia. Therapeutic results were evaluated by postoperative facial nerve injury, with the House-Brackman scale; every patient was examined for adequate facial musculature function immediately after surgery. Notably, zero patients presented facial nerve injury. These results imply that the modified endaural approach with a peripheral dissection of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system to access the temporomandibular joint reduces the incidence of facial nerve injuries, improves operative site exposure, and lowers the frequency of complications.", "AIM: While functionally stable osteosynthesis is a generally accepted method to treat all dislocated fractures of the skull, open reduction and rigid fixation of fractures of the mandibular condyle are still controversial. The risks involved in the surgical approaches and the difficulties during reposition are the main controversies. Improvements made in surgical access and osteosynthesis materials as well as the development of special instruments were the reasons for re-evaluating the surgical results. METHODS: Forty patients with displaced or dislocated fractures of the mandibular condyle were re-examined. In 20 patients (21 fractures) an intraoral approach, in 20 more patients (24 fractures) an extraoral perimandibular approach was applied. The results were compared by means of axiography and radiology as well as clinically with regard to function 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: While almost all fractures were correctly reduced following application of an extraoral access, reduction was correct in only 50% of the patients treated with an intraoral approach. Re-displacement and complications during osteosynthesis were the reasons. The group of patients treated via the intraoral approach showed less favourable results radiologically, clinically, and as judged by the patients' subjective feelings. Especially axiographical examination of the latter fractures revealed a restricted translation indicating that the fractures had not healed primarily. CONCLUSION: In order to avoid complications, the only fractures which should be treated intraorally are those which allow exact reduction even under the conditions of a limited view and reduced possibilities of surgical manipulation during reduction. This applies in general to fractures of the mandibular condyle with a laterally displaced condyle and a shortened ascending ramus. For all other dislocated or displaced fractures, extraoral reduction and osteosynthesis are the methods of choice.", "BACKGROUND: Anterior mandibular osteotomy gives excellent access to the oropharynx for oncologic resections. Although rigid internal fixation has improved results in stability and bone healing, side effects and complications of the surgical procedure must be considered. METHODS: Between 1991 and 1997, 64 patients underwent a transmandibular approach for benign or malignant tumors of the head and neck. Sixty-one of them were included in a 6-month follow-up study. Final results and major and minor complications were recorded. RESULTS: Three (5%) cases of non-union and infection of the osteotomy site required plate removal, curettage, and reosteosynthesis. Occlusal disturbances and local periodontal disease occurred in 2 (3%) patients. Thirty-two (52%) patients complained of sensitivity disturbances, 18 (30%) of temporomandibular joint pain, and 44 (72%) of a limitation in opening the mouth. Six patients (10%) had a cosmetic complaint. CONCLUSION: Dental condition and periodontal care in the vicinity of the osteotomy are important factors in reducing the risk of major complications. Trismus, limitation of joint motion, and pain cannot be directly related to the technique; they depend on the extent of tumor resection and postoperative radiotherapy.", "BACKGROUND: Computer-assisted navigated piezoelectric surgery (CANPS) is a surgical technique that combines the surgical navigation with a piezoelectric device. This association multiplies the advantages of both technologies, taking the best of each one providing a synergistic association. OBJECTIVE: To describe and assess the indications, advantages, disadvantages, and complications of this association of surgical techniques. METHODS: CANPS was used in 32 patients. The clinical diagnosis was facial trauma, tumors, orthognathic surgeries, temporomandibular joint ankylosis, pathology of the frontal sinus, and alveolar distraction. Nineteen patients were men and 13 were women. Planning software iPlan 3.05 of Brainlab, and Elements of Brainlab were used for planning and the Kolibri and Kurve of Brainlab for surgical navigation. The piezoelectric device used was a \"Vercelotti\" type in all patients. RESULTS: CAPNS could be performed successfully in all cases without complications and reduced the surgeon's uncertainty during the osteotomies. There is continuous control of the position of the surgical instrument. The use of the navigated piezoelectric device allowed the surgeon's uncertainty to be reduced during the performance of the osteotomies in depth, in poorly visible areas, with little access or reduced visibility. It also increases the safety of bone resections near important anatomical structures. CONCLUSIONS: CANPS combines the advantages of piezoelectric surgery and navigation. CANPS affords real-time control of the position of the cutting tip and allows semiburied approaches. CANPS allows surgery to be precise, safer, and minimally invasive."]}
{"question": "Is vitamin D deficiency a feature of pediatric celiac disease?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy characterized by villus atrophy and malabsorption of essential nutrients. Vitamin D deficiency has been described in autoimmune diseases, but its status in prepubertal children with CD has not been adequately studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine the vitamin D status of prepubertal children with CD. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of prepubertal children aged 3-12 years with CD (n=24) who were compared to prepubertal, non-CD children of the same age (n=50). Children were included in the study if they had a diagnosis of CD by intestinal biopsy, and were not on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients were excluded if they had diseases of calcium or vitamin D metabolism, or were receiving calcium or vitamin D supplementation or had other autoimmune diseases. All subjects had their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level measured. RESULTS: There was no difference in 25(OH)D level between the CD and non-CD children (27.58 +/- 9.91 versus 26.20 +/- 10.45, p = 0.59). However, when the patients were subdivided into obese and non-obese groups, the non-obese CD patients had a significantly higher 25(OH)D level than the obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 21.58 +/- 5.67, p = 0.009). In contrast, there was no difference in 25(OH)D level between non-obese CD patients and non-obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 30.64 +/-12.08, p = 0.52). The season of 25(OH)D measurement was not a significant confounder (p =0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) causes deficiency of various micronutrients including vitamin D, and there are no specific guidelines for treatment. AIMS: To determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in children newly diagnosed with CD and the role of oral high-dose vitamin D in its treatment. METHODS: Calcium intake, sun exposure and biochemical and radiological parameters related to vitamin D deficiency were compared between 60 children aged 0-18 years diagnosed with CD and 60 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. The cases with serum 25(OH)D (<20 ng/ml) were given oral vitamin D (60,000 IU/week) and calcium (500 mg/day) for 12 weeks, along with a gluten-free diet (GFD); they were re-evaluated within a week of completion. The primary outcome measure was the serum 25(OH)D level, and secondary measures included serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathormone and clinical and/or radiological rickets. RESULTS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <20 ng/ml) was significantly greater in the cases (n=38, 63.3%) than in the controls (n=27, 45.0%). Upon treatment, all 38 cases with vitamin D deficiency showed a significant rise in 25(OH)D levels along with normalisation of other biochemical abnormalities. Two children had 25(OH)D levels >100 ng/ml with no other feature suggestive of vitamin D toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in children with CD. Administration of oral high-dose vitamin D for 12 weeks along with a GFD leads to a robust response, indicating rapid mucosal recovery. The vitamin D dosage recommended for malabsorption states may be excessive in CD.Abbreviations: ALP: alkaline phosphatase; CaBP: calcium-binding proteins; CD: coeliac disease; GFD: gluten-free diet; PTH: parathormone; RU: reproducibility units; 25(OH)D: 25 hydroxy vitamin D.", "OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical features and relevant laboratory investigations of patient with celiac disease (CD) and comparing classical celiac disease (CCD) with Non-diarrheal celiac disease (NDCD). METHODS: This is a five years retrospective study conducted at The Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, Pakistan from January 2010 to December 2015, enrolling children from one year to 15 years of either gender diagnosed as celiac disease in accordance with revised ESPGHAN criteria. Biopsy samples with grade 2 or more on Modified Marsh Classification were considered as consistent with celiac disease. Celiac patients were categorized into Classical celiac disease (with Chronic Diarrhea) and non-diarrheal celiac disease (Atypical celiac) and their clinical features and relevant laboratory investigations were documented. RESULTS: Total 66 patients were selected with celiac disease according to inclusion criteria, 39 (59.09%) patients were labeled as CCD and 27 (40.91%) patients were labeled as NDCD. Marsh grading 3a and above were more marked in CCD as compared to NDCD. Mean titer for Tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TTG) were higher in CCD group in comparison to NDCD group. In CCD, the most common clinical presentations were abdominal distension whereas in NDCD, the most remarkable features were recurrent abdominal pain (62.9%). Frequency of failure to thrive is significantly high in CCD (82.05%) but patients merely with short stature were more common in NDCD (33.3%). Refractory anemia was present in 66.6% patients in NDCD group and 41.1% patients in CCD group. 74.3% patients in CCD group were vitamin D deficient whereas 85% patient had vitamin D deficiency in NDCD group (p= 0.03). CONCLUSION: NDCD is not uncommon in our population. Recurrent abdominal pain, failure to thrive or patients only with short stature and refractory anemia are prominent features in NCDC group whereas abdominal distension, failure to thrive and recurrent abdominal pain were noticeable features in CCD. High grade histopathology and raised antibodies titer is hallmark of CCD.

Its diagnosis might be masked by clinical, biochemical, and radiological features of rickets. CASE PRESENTATION: A 12-year-old Sudanese boy presented with progressive lower limbs deformity and difficulty in walking for six months. It was associated with fatigability, poor appetite, and generalized bone pain. On examination, he was thin, disproportionately short and pubertal, and had bilateral genu valgum deformity. X-rays showed osteopenia and signs of rickets. Biochemical workup revealed mildly elevated serum calcium, low phosphate, high alkaline phosphatase, and high parathyroid hormone with low 25-hydroxy vitamin D(3). Celiac screening, liver function test and renal profile were normal. Serum calcium rose dramatically after vitamin D therapy. Genetic testing was negative for CYP2R1 and MEN1 genes. Ultrasound neck showed left inferior parathyroid adenoma which was surgically excised. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma. Postoperatively, he had hypocalcemia which was treated with calcium and alfacalcidol. Corrective surgery is planned for the genu valgum deformity which markedly improved after parathyroidectomy. CONCLUSION: Although PHPT is extremely rare in the young population, it should be considered in patients with rickets and elevated serum calcium at baseline or after initiating vitamin D therapy."]}
{"question": "Are financial incentives cost-effective to support smoking cessation during pregnancy?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIMS: To evaluate whether adding financial incentives to usual care is cost-effective in encouraging pregnant women to quit tobacco smoking, compared with usual care alone. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) from a health-care provider's perspective, embedded in the Smoking Cessation in Pregnancy Incentives Trial (CPIT III). Long-term analyses were conducted from the same perspective, using an existing Markov model over a life-time horizon. SETTING: Seven maternity smoking cessation sites in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: In the short-term analysis, CPIT III participants were assessed: women 16 years or older, self-reporting as smokers, fewer than 24 weeks pregnant and English-speaking (n = 944). The same population was used for the life-time analysis, plus their infants. MEASUREMENTS: Costs included financial incentive vouchers and postage, cessation support and nicotine replacement therapy and neonatal stays. The outcome measure was a biochemically verified quit rate for the CEA and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for CUA. Costs are presented in 2020 GBP sterling ( pound). Data for the life-time analysis came from the trial and were combined with data from published literature embedded in the model, reporting incremental cost per quitter and QALY. A 3.5% discount rate was applied. FINDINGS: The short-term incremental cost per quitter was  pound4400 and cost per QALY was  pound150 000. Results of sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. The long-term analysis combined costs and outcomes for mother and infants; results showed a cost saving of  pound37 [95% confidence interval (CI]) =  pound35-106] and increase in QALYs of 0.171 (95% CI = 0.124-0.229). These findings indicate that, over a life-time, financial incentives are cost-saving and improve health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In the United Kingdom, offering up to  pound400 financial incentives, in addition to usual care, to support pregnant women to stop smoking appears to be highly cost-effective over a life-time for mother and infants.", "AIMS: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of up to  pound400 worth of financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy as an adjunct to routine health care. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on a Phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a cost-utility analysis using a life-time Markov model. SETTING: The RCT was undertaken in Glasgow, Scotland. The economic analysis was undertaken from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 612 pregnant women randomized to receive usual cessation support plus or minus financial incentives of up to  pound400 vouchers (US $609), contingent upon smoking cessation. MEASUREMENTS: Comparison of usual support and incentive interventions in terms of cotinine-validated quitters, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct costs to the NHS. FINDINGS: The incremental cost per quitter at 34-38 weeks pregnant was  pound1127 ($1716).This is similar to the standard look-up value derived from Stapleton & West's published ICER tables,  pound1390 per quitter, by looking up the Cessation in Pregnancy Incentives Trial (CIPT) incremental cost ( pound157) and incremental 6-month quit outcome (0.14). The life-time model resulted in an incremental cost of  pound17 [95% confidence interval (CI) = - pound93,  pound107] and a gain of 0.04 QALYs (95% CI = -0.058, 0.145), giving an ICER of  pound482/QALY ($734/QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates uncertainty in these results, particularly regarding relapse after birth. The expected value of perfect information was  pound30 million (at a willingness to pay of  pound30 000/QALY), so given current uncertainty, additional research is potentially worthwhile.

Developing more effective smoking-cessation interventions for pregnant women has been a public-health priority for more than thirty years. We review developments over the past three years (2012-15) on the use of financial incentives to promote smoking cessation among pregnant women. We searched the literature for reports on primary and secondary analyses and reviews of controlled trials on this topic published in peer-reviewed journals using the search engine PubMed, reviewed bibliographies of published articles, and consulted expert colleagues. The search revealed several important developments, with the following three being especially noteworthy. First, the review identified four new randomized controlled trials, three of which further supported the efficacy of this treatment approach. One of the three trials supporting efficacy also included the first econometric analysis of this treatment approach showing financial incentives with pregnant smokers to be highly cost-effective. Second, two Cochrane reviews were published during this 3-year period covering the more recent and earlier efficacy trials. Meta-analyses in both reviews supported the efficacy of the approach. Lastly, the first effectiveness trial was reported demonstrating that financial incentives increased abstinence rates above control levels when implemented by obstetrical clinic staff in a large urban hospital working with community tobacco interventionists. Overall, there is a growing and compelling body of evidence supporting the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of financial incentives for smoking cessation among pregnant women.", "Higgins and colleagues' recently-completed randomized controlled trial and pooled data with 4 related trials of smoking cessation in pregnant women in Vermont (USA) showed that abstinence-contingent financial incentives (FI) increased abstinence over control conditions from early pregnancy through 24-weeks postpartum. Control conditions were best practices (BP) alone in the recent trial and payments provided independent of smoking status (noncontingently) in the others. This paper reports economic analyses of abstinence-contingent FI. Merging trial results with maternal and infant healthcare costs from all Vermont Medicaid deliveries in 2019, we computed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and compared them to established thresholds. The healthcare sector cost (+/-standard error) of adding FI to BP averaged $634.76 +/- $531.61 per participant. Based on this trial, the increased probability per BP + FI participant of smoking abstinence at 24-weeks postpartum was 3.17%, the cost per additional abstinent woman was $20,043, the incremental health gain was 0.0270 +/- 0.0412 QALYs, the ICER was $23,511/QALY gained, and the probabilities that BP + FI was very cost-effective (ICER</=$65,910) and cost-effective (ICER</=$100,000) were 67.9% and 71.0%, respectively. Based on the pooled trials, the corresponding values were even more favorable-8.89%, $7138, 0.0758 +/- 0.0178 QALYs, $8371/QALY, 98.6% and 99.3%, respectively. Each dollar invested in abstinence-contingent FI over control smoking-cessation programs yielded $4.20 in economic benefits in the recent trial and $11.90 in the pooled trials (very favorable benefit-cost ratios).

The incentive group (n = 505) could receive $460 for completing pre-birth visits ($25 each), post-birth home visits ($40, $25, $25, $40 for 1-week, 2-month, 4-month and 6-month visits), monthly smoking cessation phone calls post-birth ($20 each), and biochemically-verified tobacco abstinence at 1-week ($40) and 6-months ($40) post-birth. The control group (n = 509) received up to $80 for 1-week ($40) and 6-month ($40) post-birth assessments. Intervention costs included incentive payments to participants, counselor and administrative staff time, and smoking cessation medications. Cost-effectiveness analysis calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per one additional smoker who quit. The incentive group had higher 6-month post-birth biochemically-confirmed tobacco abstinence than the control group (14.7% vs. 9.2%). Incremental costs averaged $184 per participant for the incentive group compared to controls ($317 vs $133). The ICER of financial incentives was $3399 (95% CI $2228 to $8509) per additional woman who was tobacco abstinent at 6 months post-birth. The ICER was lower ($2518 vs $4760) for women who did not live with another smoker. This study shows use of financial incentives for stop smoking treatment is a cost-effective option for low-income pregnant women who smoke."]}
{"question": "Can bone thickness and inter-radicular space affect miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: The proper angle of miniscrew insertion is important for cortical anchorage, patient safety, and biomechanical control. The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45 degrees , 60 degrees , and 90 degrees  in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 +/- 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships. The inter-radicular space ranged from 2.46 to 3.31 mm, and alveolar bone thickness ranged from 8.01 to 13.77 mm. The thickness tended to decrease with the increase in insertion angle from 45 degrees  to 90 degrees . No significant differences between the genders or types of malocclusion were found. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the safest areas for the placement of miniscrews are between the first and second premolars and between the first and second molars, regardless of the angle of insertion."]}

METHOD: Consenting eligible adults (N=238) from 18-100 years of age consecutively admitted to inpatient psychiatry units were assessed using the SCID I and II, the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced Scale (COPE), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), the 12 Item Short-Form Heath Survey (SF12), the Sarason Social Support Questionnaire, and the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) (cognitively impaired, and non-English speaking patients were excluded). RESULTS: Older adults reported less symptomatology than younger patients and younger patients described more personality dysfunction than older patients. As assessed by the COPE, older adults reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies than younger adults. Personality traits, social supports, gender, and age predicted coping strategies, while Axis I diagnosis, education, personality disorder, and symptom severity were not significant predictors of coping strategies. CONCLUSION: This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies."]}
{"question": "Can 'high-risk' human papillomaviruses (HPVs) be detected in human breast milk?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: Human papillomavirus (HPV) transmission via nonsexual modes in childhood has been proposed by several researchers. The aim of our study was to determine the presence of 'high-risk' HPV DNA in human breast milk. METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction techniques, we evaluated the presence of HPV infection in human breast milk collected from 21 HPV-positive and 11 HPV-negative mothers. RESULTS: Of the 32 studied human milk specimens, no 'high-risk' HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 or 58 DNA was detected. CONCLUSION: This preliminary case-control study indicates the absence of mucosal 'high-risk' HPV types in human breast milk.", "Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA has been detected in the oral cavity of infants and breast cancer tissue, suggesting its vertical transmission through maternal milk. We determined whether HPV is detected in maternal milk and is vertically transmitted by breast-feeding. Informed consent was obtained, and maternal milk samples (n=80) were analysed for high-risk HPV DNA. In 43 women, this DNA was measured in the uterine cervix. In women with positive samples, this DNA was measured in the oral cavities of their children. The domain including HPV E6 and E7 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using consensus primers, and HPV serotype determined by electrophoresis after restriction enzyme digestion. High-risk HPV-16 was detected in two of 80 samples (2.5%), and in these two cases, high-risk HPV was not detected in the uterine cervix or oral cavity of the child. It was concluded that the infection of HPV in maternal milk is rare (2/80); vertical transmission through maternal milk was not detected in this study (0/80). HPV infection through maternal milk may occur, but its likelihood is low."]}

METHODS: We systematically evaluated all consecutive patients undergoing QC in our institution over a 12-year period (October 2000-January 2012). All relevant surgical and clinical outcome parameters were systematically assessed. RESULTS: Forty-nine EOC patients (median age: 57; range: 28-76) underwent QC; in a median of 16 months (range:2-142) after previous chemotherapy. The majority of the patients had an initial FIGO stage III (67.3%), peritoneal carcinomatosis (77.6%) and no ascites (67.3%). At QC, patients presented following tumour pattern: lower abdomen 85.7%; middle abdomen 79.6% and upper abdomen 42.9%. Median duration of surgery was 292 min (range: a total macroscopic tumour clearance could be achieved. Rates of major operative morbidity and 30-day mortality were 28.6% and 2%, respectively.Mean follow-up from QC was 18.41 months (95% confidence interval (CI):12.64-24.18) and mean overall survival (OS) 23.05 months (95% CI: 15.5-30.6). Mean OS for patients without vs any tumour residuals was 43 months (95% CI: 26.4-59.5) vs 13.4 months (95% CI: 7.42-19.4); P=0.001. Mean OS for patients who received postoperative chemotherapy (n=18; 36.7%) vs those who did not was 40.5 months (95% CI: 27.4-53.6) vs 12.03 months (95% CI: 5.9-18.18); P<0.001.Multivariate analysis indentified multifocal tumour dissemination to be of predictive significance for incomplete tumour resection, higher operative morbidity and lower survival, while systemic chemotherapy subsequent to QC had a protective significant impact on OS. No prognostic impact had ascites, platinum resistance, high grading and advanced age. CONCLUSION: Even in this highly advanced setting of the third EOC relapse, maximal therapeutic effort combining optimal surgery and chemotherapy appear to significantly prolong survival in a selected patients 'group'."]}
{"question": "Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified."]}
{"question": "Does topical ropivacaine reduce the post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: To determine whether post-operative administration of topical ropivacaine hydrochloride decreases morbidity following adenotonsillectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: University referral center; ENT Department. PARTICIPANTS: Fourty one children, aged 4-16 years, undergoing tonsillectomy. METHODS: Patients received 1.0% ropivacaine hydrochloride soaked swabs packed in their tonsillar fossae while the control group received saline-soaked swabs. Mc Grath's face scale was used to compare the two groups in respect of pain control. Chi-square and two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney-U-tests were used to compare the two independent groups. As 10 we made 11 comparison between groups, for Bonferroni correction, p<0.005 was accepted as statistically significant. RESULTS: Only first hour there was no significant pain-relieving effect seen in the ropivacaine group (p>0.05). The other hours and days there were statistically significance between the two groups (p<0.001). Also, the other post-operative parameters such as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia and trismus were not statistically different between the two groups. There were no complications associated with ropivacaine hydrochloride. No patients in this study suffered systemic side effects related to the use of this medication. CONCLUSION: Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour."]}
{"question": "Is pain a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital. METHODS: Using a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored. RESULTS: The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609). CONCLUSION: We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "BACKGROUND: Childhood trauma is considered to be a risk factor for developing anxiety as well as chronic pain. The aim of this study was to assess the association between childhood trauma and reporting anxiety and long-term pain conditions in the general and clinical populations.

RESULTS: Reporting emotional abuse (Odds ratio OR from 2.14 to 14.71), emotional neglect (OR from 2.42 to 10.99), or physical neglect (OR from 2.24 to 3.30) was associated with reporting anxiety and long-term pain both in the general and clinical populations and reporting physical abuse moreover with reporting anxiety or adjustment disorder with concurrent long-term pain (OR from 4.04 to 6.39). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the relevance of childhood trauma as a possible factor contributing to anxiety with concurrent pain conditions in adulthood in both the general and clinical populations.", "OBJECTIVE: Pain is a frequent long-term consequence of stroke, but its relation to emotional and social well-being is poorly studied in stroke populations. We aimed to identify the prevalence of substantial pain among institutionalized stroke patients and to explore its relation to emotional distress (ED) and low social engagement (SE). METHODS: In a cross-sectional design, we collected data of 274 chronic stroke patients in Dutch nursing homes. Observation lists were filled out in structured interviews with qualified nurse assistants who knew the residents well. Pain and SE were measured with the Resident Assessment Instrument for Long-term Care Facilities, and ED was measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPIQ). RESULTS: Substantial pain was present in 28% of the residents, mostly located in the affected body side (68%). Multilevel regression analyses revealed that this pain was independently related to a 60% increase in NPIQ score (beta 3.18 [1.84-4.53]) and to clinically relevant symptoms of delusions (odds ratio [OR] 8.45 [1.82-39.05]), agitation/aggression (OR 3.82 [1.76-8.29]), depression (OR 3.49 [1.75-6.98]), and anxiety (OR 2.32 [1.08-4.97]). Substantial pain was associated with low SE when adjusted for clinical covariates (OR 4.25 [1.72-10.53]), but only in residents with no/mild or severe cognitive impairment. This relation disappeared when additionally corrected for NPIQ score (OR 1.95 [0.71-5.39]). CONCLUSIONS: Pain is a serious and multidimensional problem among institutionalized stroke patients. It is related to increased ED, which in turn can be a pathway to low SE as an indicator of social vulnerability. Future research should reveal how pain management in nursing homes can be tailored to the needs of this patient group.", "IMPORTANCE: In primary chronic back pain (CBP), the belief that pain indicates tissue damage is both inaccurate and unhelpful. Reattributing pain to mind or brain processes may support recovery. OBJECTIVES: To test whether the reattribution of pain to mind or brain processes was associated with pain relief in pain reprocessing therapy (PRT) and to validate natural language-based tools for measuring patients' symptom attributions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This secondary analysis of clinical trial data analyzed natural language data from patients with primary CBP randomized to PRT, placebo injection control, or usual care control groups and treated in a US university research setting. Eligible participants were adults aged 21 to 70 years with CBP recruited from the community. Enrollment extended from 2017 to 2018, with the current analyses conducted from 2020 to 2022. INTERVENTIONS: PRT included cognitive, behavioral, and somatic techniques to support reattributing pain to nondangerous, reversible mind or brain causes. Subcutaneous placebo injection and usual care were hypothesized not to affect pain attributions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: At pretreatment and posttreatment, participants listed their top 3 perceived causes of pain in their own words (eg, football injury, bad posture, stress); pain intensity was measured as last-week average pain (0 to 10 rating, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating greatest pain). The number of attributions categorized by masked coders as reflecting mind or brain processes were summed to yield mind-brain attribution scores (range, 0-3). An automated scoring algorithm was developed and benchmarked against human coder-derived scores. A data-driven natural language processing (NLP) algorithm identified the dimensional structure of pain attributions. RESULTS: We enrolled 151 adults (81 female [54%], 134 White [89%], mean [SD] age, 41.1 [15.6] years) reporting moderate severity CBP (mean [SD] intensity, 4.10 [1.26]; mean [SD] duration, 10.0 [8.9] years). At pretreatment, 41 attributions (10%) were categorized as mind- or brain-related across intervention conditions. PRT led to significant increases in mind- or brain-related attributions, with 71 posttreatment attributions (51%) in the PRT condition categorized as mind- or brain-related, as compared with 22 (8%) in control conditions (mind-brain attribution scores: PRT vs placebo, g = 1.95 [95% CI, 1.45-2.47]; PRT vs usual care, g = 2.06 [95% CI, 1.57-2.60]). Consistent with hypothesized PRT mechanisms, increases in mind-brain attribution score were associated with reductions in pain intensity at posttreatment (standardized beta = -0.25; t127 = -2.06; P = .04) and mediated the effects of PRT vs control on 1-year follow-up pain intensity (beta = -0.35 [95% CI, -0.07 to -0.63]; P = .05). The automated word-counting algorithm and human coder-derived scores achieved moderate and substantial agreement at pretreatment and posttreatment (Cohen kappa = 0.42 and 0.68, respectively). The data-driven NLP algorithm identified a principal dimension of mind and brain vs biomechanical attributions, converging with hypothesis-driven analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of a randomized trial, PRT increased attribution of primary CBP to mind- or brain-related causes. Increased mind-brain attribution was associated with reductions in pain intensity.", "INTRODUCTION: Pain, depression, and anxiety are prominent symptoms that frequently co-occur, causing significant debilitation and frequent primary care visits. This paper examines the acceptability of telecare and self-management modules in managing these conditions in a randomized trial. METHODS: The Comprehensive Management of Mood and Physical Symptoms (CAMMPS) trial compared an automated symptom management (ASM) plus self-management intervention with a comprehensive symptom management (CSM) intervention that added telecare facilitation of enhanced services. Data from the CAMMPS trial were analysed to compare the acceptability of these two interventions as indicated by utilization and patient satisfaction surveys. RESULTS: The mean number of automated reports completed was similar between the CSM and ASM groups (14.5 vs 14.0). Responses designated with clinically relevant \"red alerts\" (i.e. patient reports warranting an expedited nurse contact) were more frequent in the CSM group (10.2 vs 8.3). The CSM and ASM groups completed a similar number of the nine self-management modules (6.3 vs 5.8). The mean helpfulness score across all modules was higher in the CSM group than in the ASM group (1.8 vs 1.5; p = .003). The most common feedback suggestion from the ASM group was to have more personal interaction, while participants from both groups commonly suggested technical improvements or requests for more flexible timing of calls. DISCUSSION: Participants generally found both interventions satisfactory, with a trend in satisfaction data suggesting that patients tended to find the CSM intervention more helpful."]}
{"question": "Does concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling improve the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Midurethral sling (MUS) can improve overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. It is unclear if anterior/apical prolapse (AA) repair provides additional benefit. We hypothesized that women with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) experience greater improvement in the OAB component of their symptoms after concomitant MUS and AA repair compared with MUS alone. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of women with bothersome MUI (defined by objective stress test and validated questionnaire) undergoing MUS alone (\"MUS-only\") or concomitant MUS and AA repair (\"MUS + AA\"). Our primary outcome was the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Severity (OAB-q SS) change score 6 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: Of 151 women, 67 (44 %) underwent MUS-only and 84 (56 %) underwent MUS + AA. The MUS-only cohort was younger and had less severe baseline prolapse (p < 0.05 for both). Postoperative complications (predominantly UTI) occurred in 35 (23 %) patients and were similar between cohorts. For all subjects mean OAB-q SS scores significantly improved postoperatively (p < 0.05). Our primary outcome, OAB-q SS change score, showed no significant differences between cohorts (30 +/- 26 MUS-only vs 25 +/- 25 MUS + AA, p = 0.20), indicating similar improvements in OAB symptoms. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed no difference in OAB-q SS change score between cohorts; however, OAB-q SS change scores were lower for women with a postoperative complication (beta = -19, 95 % CI -31 to -6; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms."]}
{"question": "Can patients be anticoagulated after intracerebral hemorrhage?", "retrieved_passages": ["Management of patients with an indication for long-term oral antithrombotic therapy who have an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) presents a therapeutic dilemma. Should antithrombotic therapy be resumed, and if so, when, using what agent, and for whom? There is no consensus for answers to these questions. In the absence of randomized trials, management of antithrombotic therapy after ICH is based on a combination of observational data, pathophysiologic concepts, and decision analysis. At the heart of the decision is an assessment of the individual patient's risk of thromboembolism off antithrombotic therapy versus risk of ICH recurrence on antithrombotic therapy.", "Oral anticoagulation in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a therapeutic challenge. The association of cerebral amyloid angiopathy with intracerebral hemorrhage, a high mortality of intracerebral hemorrhage especially under oral anticoagulation and the high risk of recurrent bleeding require a multidisciplinary approach and a thorough risk-benefit analysis. Vitamin K antagonists increase the risk of intracerebral bleeding and the accompanying mortality by 60% and should be avoided if possible or reserved for special clinical situations (e.g. mechanical aortic valve replacement). Treatment with novel oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs also increases the risk of cerebral bleeding and therefore needs a thorough risk-benefit evaluation. An interventional left atrial appendage closure is a promising therapeutic option especially in patients with an absolute arrythmia with atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, other clinical implications in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the subject of this review of the literature, such as special characteristics after acute ischemic stroke and the necessary secondary prophylaxis, with previous intracerebral hemorrhage and in patients with cognitive deficits.", "The incidence of oral anticoagulation-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (OAC-ICH) is growing due to the increasing use of warfarin and the older age of treated patients. Recent population studies reveal that OAC-ICH currently occurs at a frequency comparable to that of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Most frequently, OAC-ICH are located in deep or lobar regions of the brain, although it may also occur in the brainstem. These hemorrhages are larger than spontaneous hematomas and may be fatal in at least 50% of cases. The primary cause of brain injury in patients with OAC-ICH is the direct mechanical disruption of the brain tissue but secondary damage may occur through the intervention of matrix metalloproteinases, glutamate, cytokines, heme, iron, and the chemical toxicity of products such as thrombin, which are released from the clot. The pathogenesis of OAC-ICH also includes the effects of aging, the level of anticoagulation, genetic factors, and a high prevalence of concurrent cerebrovascular conditions, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, leukoaraiosis or previous strokes. The treatment of OAC-ICH is challenging and involves rapid reversal of anticoagulation with hemostatic drug therapies such as vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa. These therapies may not always be sufficient to stabilize the patient's clinical condition and lacking randomized controlled trials, the best hematological approach to reverse oral anticoagulation is debated. Other difficult decisions reviewed in this article are whether anticoagulation should be restarted after OAC-ICH, and when anticoagulant treatment should be resumed. The newer oral anticoagulants, which are increasingly being introduced for thromboembolism prevention, may confer a lower risk of intracranial bleeding than warfarin, although they do not have an antidote and their anticoagulant effect is difficult to monitor.", "INTRODUCTION: The management of antithrombotic therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in anticoagulated patients is not well defined. We analyzed the risks and benefits of antiplatelet therapy (AG) against the resumption of anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (AVK) in a series of patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of ICH in anticoagulated patients. We registered demographic data, history of hypertension (HT), time of follow-up and new cerebral vascular events (ICH, stroke [IC]). RESULTS: We evaluated 88 patients, mean age 69+/-9 years, 50% men, 73% hypertensive. During the acute phase 18 patients died and the follow-up was lost in 31. Of the remaining (n=39), AVKs were resumed in 25 and changed to AG in 14. Comparing the characteristics of both groups, the anticoagulated group was younger (P=.005) and the embolic sources were more often of higher risk (P=.003). After an average follow-up of 54+/-31 months, the distribution of events was: IC (AVKs 8%, AG 14.3%, P=.6), ICH (AVKs 24%, AG 7.1%, P=.38), IC or ICH (AVKs 32%, AG 21.4%, P=.48) and death (AVKs 29%, AG 7.1%, P=.21). This trend of increased risk of new events in patients with AVKs was confirmed by Kaplan-Meier curves, although without statistical differences. CONCLUSIONS: Restarting AVK treatment after ICH in anticoagulated patients could increase the risk of new bleeding events and mortality. Prospective studies are needed to define a better and appropriate antithrombotic therapy after ICH related with anticoagulation.", "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there are modifiable risk factors for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in patients receiving oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review between January 2002 and December 2004. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 315 consecutive patients presenting with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall mortality rates and surgical mortality rates, and discharge home compared with discharge to a long-term care facility. RESULTS: Of the 315 patients reviewed, 65 (20.6%) were receiving OAC therapy. Age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and size of hematoma at presentation were similar in the 65 patients taking OAC and the 250 patients not taking it. Mean arterial pressure at presentation was significantly higher in the OAC group than in the control group (132 mm Hg vs 107 mm Hg, P = .01) as was the number of hematomas that progressed (52% vs 14%, P = .01). Overall mortality rates were higher in the OAC group than in the control group (52% vs 41%, P = .03) as were surgical mortality rates (62% vs 41%, P = .04). There were no significant differences in morbidity between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Mortality rates were higher among patients taking OAC therapy despite their having similarly sized hematomas at presentation. The higher initial mean arterial pressure among such patients has not been described previously in this setting. This higher mean arterial pressure correlates with the propensity of these patients' hematomas to expand after initial imaging and might partially mediate the mortality effect. In patients taking OAC, hypertension appears to be a modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality from intracerebral hemorrhage."]}
{"question": "Does managed care enable more low income persons to identify a usual source of care?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: By requiring or encouraging enrollees to obtain a usual source of care, managed care programs hope to improve access to care without incurring higher costs. OBJECTIVES: (1) To examine the effects of managed care on the likelihood of low-income persons having a usual source of care and a usual physician, and; (2) To examine the association between usual source of care and access. RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of households conducted during 1996 and 1997. SUBJECTS: A nationally representative sample of 14,271 low-income persons. MEASURES: Usual source of care, usual physician, managed care enrollment, managed care penetration. RESULTS: High managed care penetration in the community is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured persons (54.8% vs. 62.2% in low penetration areas) as well as a lower likelihood of having a usual physician (60% vs. 72.8%). Managed care has only marginal effects on the likelihood of having a usual source of care for privately insured and Medicaid beneficiaries. Having a usual physician substantially reduces unmet medical needs for the insured but less so for the uninsured. CONCLUSIONS: Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons."]}
{"question": "Is distance to provider a barrier to care for medicaid patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Distance to provider might be an important barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment for cancer patients who qualify for Medicaid coverage. Whether driving time or driving distance is a better indicator of travel burden is also of interest. METHODS: Driving distances and times from patient residence to primary care provider were calculated for 3,917 breast, colorectal (CRC) and lung cancer Medicaid patients in Washington State from 1997 to 2003 using MapQuest.com. We fitted regression models of stage at diagnosis and time-to-treatment (number of days between diagnosis and surgery) to test the hypothesis that travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment of cancer. FINDINGS: Later stage at diagnosis for breast cancer Medicaid patients is associated with travel burden (OR = 1.488 per 100 driving miles, P= .037 and OR = 1.270 per driving hour, P= .016). Time-to-treatment after diagnosis of CRC is also associated with travel burden (14.57 days per 100 driving miles, P= .002 and 5.86 days per driving hour, P= .018). CONCLUSIONS: Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.", "BACKGROUND: In the United States, most lung cancer cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, limiting treatment options and impacting survival. This study presents patients' perspectives on the complexity of factors influencing a lung cancer diagnosis. Lung cancer awareness regarding risks, symptoms, smoking behaviors, family history, and environmental factors can lead to preventative and early detection measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore lung cancer patient perspectives on lung cancer awareness within the context of an earlier study to understand sleep-wake disturbances in adults with non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: A content analysis was used to analyze the original deidentified longitudinal interview data collected from 26 patients diagnosed with lung cancer. RESULTS: Of the original 26 participants, 16 were included in this secondary data analysis. The participants were primarily females (n = 10) and Whites (n = 13), with ages ranging between 49 and 83 years. Half of the sample was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer and most of the sample was on chemotherapy (n = 10). Two key themes were identified: the lung cancer discovery and the patient-physician relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Unspecific initial symptoms, lack of knowledge and screening, as well as fear of the diagnosis delayed seeking medical care. Patient-physician relationships were hindered by smoking-associated stigma, inadequate sharing of information, and lack of coordinated, holistic care. Positive communication strategies are critical between patients and providers to meet patients' specific needs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Educational interventions that enhance lung cancer awareness may improve prevention and screening actions, improve timely healthcare intervention, and reduce incidence and mortality.", "The public health imperative to reduce the burden of lung cancer has seen unprecedented progress in recent years. Fully realizing the advances in lung cancer treatment and control requires attention to potential barriers in their momentum and implementation. In this analysis, we present and evaluate the argument that stigma is a highly significant barrier to fulfilling the clinical promise of advanced care and reduced lung cancer burden. This evaluation of the stigma of lung cancer is based on a multilevel perspective that incorporates the individual, persons in the individual's immediate environment, the health care system, and the larger societal structure that shapes perceptions and decisions. We also consider current interventions and interventional needs within and across aspects of the lung cancer continuum, including prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. Current evidence suggests that stigma detrimentally affects psychosocial, communication, and behavioral outcomes over the entire lung cancer control continuum and across multiple levels. Interventional efforts to alleviate stigma in the context of lung cancer show promise, yet more work is needed to evaluate their impact. Understanding and addressing the multilevel role of stigma is a crucial area for future study to realize the full benefits offered by lung cancer prevention, control, and treatment. Coordinated, interdisciplinary, and well-conceptualized efforts have the potential to reduce the barrier of stigma in the context of lung cancer and facilitate demonstrable improvements in clinical care and quality of life.", "As a nursing student my knowledge of caring for patients with lung cancer had been rather limited. The article provided information on the risk factors for lung cancer, diagnostic investigations, treatment options and the nurse's role in improving quality of life and experience of care for patients.", "Lung cancer is the world's leading cause of cancer death. Screening for lung cancer by low-dose computed tomography improves mortality. Various modalities exist for diagnosis and staging. Treatment is determined by subtype and stage of cancer; there are several personalized therapies that did not exist just a few years ago. Caring for the patient with lung cancer is a complex task. This review provides a broad outline of this disease, helping clinicians identify such patients and familiarizing them with lung cancer care options, so they are better equipped to guide their patients along this challenging journey."]}
{"question": "Can folic acid protect against congenital heart defects in Down syndrome?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested a protective effect of folic acid (FA) on congenital heart anomalies. Down syndrome (DS) infants are known to have a high frequency of heart anomalies. Not all children with DS suffer from heart anomalies, which raises the question whether maternal factors might affect the risk of these anomalies. Our objectives were to investigate whether first-trimester FA use protects against heart anomalies among DS children. METHODS: Women with liveborn DS children participating in the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study between 1976 and 1997 were included. We performed case-control analyses using DS, with heart anomalies as cases and DS, without heart anomalies as controls. Subanalyses were performed for defects that have been associated with FA in non-DS populations (conotruncal, ventricular septal [VSD]) and for those that are associated with DS (ostium secundum type atrial septal defects [ASD] and endocardial cushion defects [ECD]). Exposure was defined as the use of any FA-containing product for an average of at least 4 days per week during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, whereas no exposure was defined as no use of FA in these 12 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 223 cases, 110 (49%) were exposed versus 84 (46%) of the 184 controls. After adjustment for possible confounders, no protective effect of FA was found on heart anomalies overall (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.61-1.47) nor separately for conotruncal defects, VSDs, ASDs, or ECDs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not show a protective effect of FA on heart anomalies among infants with DS."]}
{"question": "Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations in manitoba?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Francophones may experience poorer health due to social status, cultural differences in lifestyle and attitudes, and language barriers to health care. Our study sought to compare mental health indicators between Francophones and non-Francophones living in the province of Manitoba. METHODS: Two populations were used: one from administrative datasets housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy and the other from representative survey samples. The administrative datasets contained data from physician billings, hospitalizations, prescription drug use, education, and social services use, and surveys included indicators on language variables and on self-rated health. RESULTS: Outside urban areas, Francophones had lower rates of diagnosed substance use disorder (rate ratio [RR] = 0.80; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95) and of suicide and suicide attempts (RR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79), compared with non-Francophones, but no differences were found between the groups across the province in rates of diagnosed mood disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia, or any mental disorders after adjusting for age, sex, and geographic area. When surveyed, Francophones were less likely than non-Francophones to report that their mental health was excellent, very good, or good (66.9%, compared with 74.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The discrepancy in how Francophones view their mental health and their rates of diagnosed mental disorders may be related to health seeking behaviours in the Francophone population. Community and government agencies should try to improve the mental health of this population through mental health promotion and by addressing language and cultural barriers to health services."]}
{"question": "Does type 1 diabetes mellitus affect Achilles tendon response to a 10\u00a0km run?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Achilles tendon structure deteriorates 2-days after maximal loading in elite athletes. The load-response behaviour of tendons may be altered in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) as hyperglycaemia accelerates collagen cross-linking. This study compared Achilles tendon load-response in participants with T1DM and controls. METHODS: Achilles tendon structure was quantified at day-0, day-2 and day-4 after a 10 km run. Ultrasound tissue characterisation (UTC) measures tendon structural integrity by classifying pixels as echo-type I, II, III or IV. Echo-type I has the most aligned collagen fibrils and IV has the least. RESULTS: Participants were 7 individuals with T1DM and 10 controls. All regularly ran distances greater than 5 km and VISA-A scores indicated good tendon function (T1DM = 94 +/- 11, control = 94 +/- 10). There were no diabetic complications and HbA1c was 8.7 +/- 2.6 mmol/mol for T1DM and 5.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/mol for control groups. Baseline tendon structure was similar in T1DM and control groups - UTC echo-types (I-IV) and anterior-posterior thickness were all p > 0.05. No response to load was seen in either T1DM or control group over the 4-days post exercise. CONCLUSION: Active individuals with T1DM do not have a heightened Achilles tendon response to load, which suggests no increased risk of tendon injury. We cannot extrapolate these findings to sedentary individuals with T1DM."]}
{"question": "Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot: are we operating too late?", "retrieved_passages": ["Residual severe pulmonary insufficiency or stenosis may result in significant myocardial dysfunction late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Although pulmonary valve replacement has been advocated for selected patients, objective improvement in right ventricular function has been difficult to demonstrate. We undertook pulmonary valve replacement in 11 patients to treat residual insufficiency (n = 8) or stenosis (n = 3) and evaluated them before and after operation by radionuclide ventriculography and M-mode echocardiography. Patients' age at the original repair was 6.6 +/- 0.6 years (range 2 to 8 years) and at subsequent valve replacement was 14.6 +/- 1.5 years (range 5 to 20 years). Indications for pulmonary valve replacement were conduit stenosis indicated by a gradient greater than or equal to 75 mm Hg (n = 3), symptoms (n = 2), progressive cardiomegaly (n = 3), and new onset of tricuspid insufficiency (n = 3). Prior to pulmonary valve replacement, right ventricular ejection fraction was 0.29 +/- 0.12 (range 0.12 to 0.48) and rose to 0.35 +/- 0.10 (range 0.19 to 0.48) at a mean of 10.5 +/- 2.3 months after operation (p less than 0.05). Improvement (defined as an increase in ejection fraction greater than 0.05) was noted in seven patients whereas four demonstrated no change. Left ventricular ejection fraction before operation (0.55 +/- 0.12) was unchanged after pulmonary valve replacement (0.54 +/- 0.06). M-mode echocardiography demonstrated significant reduction in right ventricular dilatation. Right ventricular/left ventricular end-diastolic dimension fell from 1.03 +/- 0.30 to 0.73 +/- 0.13 after operation (p less than 0.01). Cardiothoracic ratio fell from 0.59 +/- 0.02 to 0.55 +/- 0.02 at a mean of 12 months after pulmonary valve replacement (p less than 0.01). Subjective improvement in exercise tolerance was noted in all seven patients who showed an increase in right ventricular ejection fraction. Of the remaining four patients, two had no improvement, one felt symptomatically improved, and one was too young for evaluation. These data demonstrate objective improvement in right ventricular function following pulmonary valve replacement and confirm the usefulness of this procedure in patients with significant right ventricular dysfunction secondary to residual pulmonary insufficiency and stenosis.", "A minority of patients with Tetralogy of Fallot (TF) survive into adulthood. These patients have been subjected to a prolong period of cyanosis and hypoxia. The aim of this study is to assess the benefits of total correction of TF in this adult population. From August 1995 to March 2005, fifty one patients underwent total correction of TF. The mean age was 22.2 years (range 16 to 38 years). There were 31 males and 20 females. Twenty two percent of patients were in NYHA functional class III prior to the operation. The mean gradient across the right ventricular outflow tract was 81.7 mmHg (range 30 to 130 mmHg). The operation was performed through the right ventricle in the majority of patients. Transannular patch was used in 33 patients. The mean follow-up period was 42 months ranging from 1 to 116 months. Hospital mortality was 1.9% (1 patient), and one patient died three months after the operation. Post-operatively 87.3% of patients were in NYHA functional class I. During the follow-up period four patients required re-operation; two for residual ventricular septal defect, one for residual pulmonary stenosis and one had pulmonary valve replacement for severe pulmonary regurgitation. Complete repair of TF in adults is feasible with acceptable mortality and morbidity. The main benefit of the operation is functional improvement in this patient population.", "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate right ventricular (RV) volume and function after pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) and to address the issue of optimal surgical timing in these patients. BACKGROUND: Chronic pulmonary regurgitation (PR) following repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) leads to RV dilation and an increased incidence of sudden cardiac death in adult patients. METHODS: We studied 25 consecutive adult patients who underwent PVR for significant PR late after repair of TOF. Radionuclide angiography was performed in all at a mean of 8.2 months (+/- 8 months) before PVR and repeated at a mean of 28.0 months (+/- 22.8 months) after the operation. Right ventricular (RV) end-systolic volume (RVESV), RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) were measured. RESULTS: Mean RVEDV, RVESV and RVEF remained unchanged after PVR (227.1 ml versus 214.9 ml, p = 0.74; 157.4 ml versus 155.4 ml, p = 0.94; 35.6% versus 34.7%, p = 0.78, respectively). Of the 10 patients with RVEF > or = 0.40 before PVR, 5 patients (50%) maintained a RVEF > or = 0.40 following PVR, whereas only 2 out of 15 patients (13%) with pre-operative values <0.40 reached an RVEF > or = 0.40 postoperatively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates."]}
{"question": "Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a premalignant condition?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is an uncommon variant of chronic cholecystitis, characterized by marked thickening of the gallbladder wall and dense local adhesions. It often mimics a gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), and may coexist with GBC, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. Furthermore, the premalignant nature of this entity is not known. This study was undertaken to assess the p53, PCNA and beta-catenin expression in XGC in comparison to GBC and chronic inflammation. METHODS: Sections from paraffin-embedded blocks of surgically resected specimens of GBC (69 cases), XGC (65), chronic cholecystitis (18) and control gallbladder (10) were stained with the monoclonal antibodies to p53 and PCNA, and a polyclonal antibody to beta-catenin. p53 expression was scored as the percentage of nuclei stained. PCNA expression was scored as the product of the percentage of nuclei stained and the intensity of the staining (1-3). A cut-off value of 80 for this score was taken as a positive result. Beta-catenin expression was scored as type of expression-membranous, cytoplasmic or nuclear staining. RESULTS: p53 mutation was positive in 52% of GBC cases and 3% of XGC, but was not expressed in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. p53 expression was lower in XGC than in GBC (P<0.0001). PCNA expression was seen in 65% of GBC cases and 11% of XGC, but not in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. PCNA expression was higher in GBC than XGC (P=0.0001), but there was no significant difference between the XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups. Beta-catenin expression was positive in the GBC, XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups. But the expression pattern in XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders was homogenously membranous, whereas in GBC the membranous expression pattern was altered to cytoplasmic and nuclear. CONCLUSION: The expression of p53, PCNA and beta-catenin in XGC was significantly different from GBC and similar to chronic cholecystitis, thus indicating the inflammatory nature of XGC and may not support a premalignant nature of the lesion.", "Xanthogranulomatous Cholecystitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gallbladder, a variant of the chronic cholecystitis. As xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is occasionally seen with carcinoma of the gallbladder, the association with cancer is a controversial issue. A focal type of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is found simultaneously with gastric cancer diagnosed preoperatively. The resected specimen was genetically studied. Polymerase chain reaction amplification, single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis for mutation of p53 showed no abnormality indicating that less association with cancer in which the mutation of p53 is often seen. Etiopathologic factors of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis might have relation with cancer, but xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis itself may not be the direct cause for cancer.", "BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the commonest gastrointestinal cancer in women of north India. Precursor epithelial lesions in GBC are known; however, the role of xanthogranulomatous (XG) inflammation in the pathogenesis of GBC is unknown. AIMS: To analyze the role of precursor lesions in the pathogenesis of GBC we studied the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of p53, carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA-19.9) in GBC, chronic cholecystitis (CC), XG cholecystitis (XGC) and precursor lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 51 GBC, 68 CC, 42 XGC and 10 normal gallbladders. All cases were evaluated for presence of precursor lesions and IHC was performed. RESULTS: p53 immunoreactivity was found in 55% GBC, 32% of dysplasia with malignancy and in 14% of dysplasia with CC. Sixteen percent GBC had associated XG inflammation. Normal and metaplastic epithelium in CC and in XGC did not express p53. CEA expression was apical in normal and inflammatory GBs (CC, XGC), while cytoplasmic focal to diffuse positivity was seen in 82% GBC. CA-19.9 expression was seen in all cases of normal and inflammatory GBs; however, foci of antral metaplasia were negative. Seventy-five percent of GBC expressed CA-19.9; all negative cases were high-grade on histology. CONCLUSIONS: Altered CEA expression is seen in GBC as compared to normal and inflammatory gallbladders. Loss of expression of CA19.9 in antral metaplasia and poorly differentiated GBC may indicate that it is a marker of biliary differentiation. p53 over-expression seen in GBC and in dysplasia associated with malignancy and with CC suggests that p53 mutation and dysplasia are early events in the evolution of GBC. Epithelial metaplasia and XG inflammation are often associated with GBC but do not appear to play a role in its pathogenesis through the p53 pathway.", "INTRODUCTION: Gallbladder cancer, which is characterized by rapid progression and a poor prognosis, is a complex disease to treat. Unfortunately, little is known currently about its etiology or pathogenesis. A better understanding of its carcinogenesis and determining risk factors that lead to its development could help improve the available treatment options. METHOD: Based on this better understanding, the histological alterations (such as acute cholecystitis, adenomyomatosis, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, polyps, pyloric metaplasia, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, cancer and others) in gallbladders from 1,689 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystolithiasis were analyzed. The association of these gallbladder histological alterations with clinical data was studied. RESULTS: Gender analysis revealed a greater incidence of inflammatory changes in males, while dysplasia and cancer were only found in women. The incidence of cholesterolosis was greater in the patients 60 years of age and under, and the incidence of adenomyomatosis and gangrene was greater in the elderly patients. A progressive increase in the average age was observed as alterations progressed through pyloric metaplasia, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and then cancer, suggesting that the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence may occur in gallbladder cancer. Gallbladder histological alterations were also observed in asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that there could be an association between some histological alterations of gallbladder and cancer, and they also suggest that the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence could in fact be true in the case of gallbladder cancer. Nevertheless, further studies directed towards a perfect understanding of gallbladder carcinogenesis are required.", "BACKGROUND: A strong association has been reported between gallbladder carcinoma, premalignant epithelial or metaplasic inflammatory lesions and cholelithiasis, varying the incidence among different ethnic groups. PURPOSE: To determine the frequency of association between such lesions and gallbladder lithiasis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined histopathologic changes in 1,367 cholecystectomy specimens with (1,096) or without (271) lithiasis and established its frequency of association, correlating with main clinical data. RESULTS: Overall, 80% had lithiasis. In this group, pseudopyloric metaplasia (50%), intestinal metaplasia (16%), low grade dysplasia (40%), high grade dysplasia (16%), carcinoma in situ (1.5%) and invasive carcinoma (2.6%) were observed compared to 25%, 2%, 17%, 2%, 0%, and 0% in the control group. The findings of 80% with lithiasis, 65% with carcinoma in situ and 90% of invasive carcinoma, all were in women. Median age of patients with low and high grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma was 42, 48, 53 and 61 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Acute and xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, adenomyomatosis, pseudopyloric and intestinal metaplasia, hyperplastic polyps, low and high grade dysplasia, tubular adenomas, carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma were more frequent when cholelithiasis was present (p < .05) than in cases without lithiasis."]}
{"question": "Does rugby headgear prevent concussion?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: To examine the attitudes of players and coaches to the use of protective headgear, particularly with respect to the prevention of concussion. METHODS: A questionnaire designed to assess attitudes to headgear was administered to 63 players from four different Canadian teams, each representing a different level of play (high school, university, community club, national). In addition, coaches from all four levels were questioned about team policies and their personal opinions about the use of headgear to prevent concussion. RESULTS: Although the players tended to believe that the headgear could prevent concussion (62%), the coaches were less convinced (33%). Despite the players' belief that headgear offers protection against concussion, only a minority reported wearing headgear (27%) and few (24%) felt that its use should be made mandatory. Common reasons for not wearing headgear were \"its use is not mandatory\", \"it is uncomfortable\", and \"it costs too much\". CONCLUSION: Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.", "Concussion is the most common match injury in rugby union. Some players wear padded headgear, but whether this protects against concussion is unclear. In professional male rugby union players, we examined: (i) the association between the use of headgear and match concussion injury incidence, and (ii) whether wearing headgear influenced time to return to play following concussion. Using a nested case-control within a cohort study, four seasons (2013-2017) of injury data from 1117 players at the highest level of rugby union in England were included. Cases were physician-diagnosed concussion injuries. Controls were other contact injuries (excluding all head injuries). We determined headgear use by viewing video footage. Sixteen percent of cases and controls wore headgear. Headgear use had no significant effect on concussion injury incidence (adjusted odds ratio=1.05, 95% CI: 0.71-1.56). Median number of days absent for concussion whilst wearing headgear was 8 days, compared with 7 days without headgear. Having sustained a concussion in the current or previous season increased the odds of concussion more than four-fold (odds ratio=4.55, 95% CI: 3.77-5.49). Wearing headgear was not associated with lower odds of concussions or a reduced number of days' absence following a concussion.", "The perceived effectiveness of rugby union headgear in reducing concussions in American male collegiate rugby union athletes was assessed. Data collection was conducted by survey method distributed using electronic mail. One hundred and thirty-one men's club rugby union participants from eight university teams in the United States were surveyed. Demographic data were assessed using frequencies, means, and standard deviations. An ANOVA was used to assess differences in the frequencies of responses between players with concussions and their perception of headgear, with an increase in positive perception of headgear with increased concussions. Player position and years of experience played a role in the number of concussions and use of protective headgear. Seventy-six different athletes reported a concussion while playing, with the majority (51%) not wearing headgear. Athletes who wore headgear experienced 24% of the concussions, compared to 76% of those who did not wear headgear. The incidence of concussions and severity of concussions were perceived as less severe among the group wearing headgear. The general perception of those individuals polled as to the effectiveness of headgear in reducing head injuries was positive.", "OBJECTIVE Multiple studies have illustrated that rugby headgear offers no statistically significant protection against concussions. However, there remains concern that many players believe rugby headgear in fact does prevent concussions. Further investigation was undertaken to illustrate that misconceptions about concussion prevention and rugby headgear may lead to an increase in aggressive play. METHODS Data were constructed by Internet survey solicitation among United States collegiate rugby players across 19 teams. Initial information given was related to club, age, experience, use of headgear, playing time, whether the rugger played football or wrestling in high school, and whether the player believed headgear prevented concussion. Data were then constructed as to whether wearing headgear would increase aggressive playing style secondary to a false sense of protection. RESULTS A total of 122 players responded. All players were male. The average player was 19.5 years old and had 2.7 years of experience. Twenty-three of 122 players (18.9%) wore protective headgear; 55.4% of players listed forward as their primary position. Overall, 45.8% (55/120) of players played 70-80 minutes per game, 44.6% (54/121) played football or wrestled in high school, 38.1% (45/118) believed headgear prevented concussions, and 42.2% (51/121) stated that if they were using headgear they would be more aggressive with their play in terms of running or tackling. Regression analysis illustrated that those who believed headgear prevented concussions were or would be more likely to engage in aggressive play (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Nearly 40% of collegiate rugby players surveyed believed headgear helped to prevent concussions despite no scientific evidence that it does. This misconception about rugby headgear could increase aggressive play. Those who believed headgear prevented concussion were, on average, 4 times more likely to play with increased aggressive form than those who believed headgear did not prevent concussions (p = 0.001). This can place all players at increased risk without providing additional protection. Further investigation is warranted to determine if headgear increases the actual measured incidence of concussion among rugby players in the United States.", "BACKGROUND: Concussion is a serious problem in many contact sports, including rugby union football. The study's primary aim was to measure the efficacy of padded headgear in reducing the rates of head injury or concussion. METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial with three arms was conducted with rugby union football teams as the unit of randomization. Teams consisted of males participating in under 13-, 15-, 18-, and 20-yr age group competitions. The interventions were \"standard\" and \"modified\" padded headgear. Headgear wearing and injury were measured for each study team at each game over two seasons. RESULTS: Eighty-two teams participated in year 1 and 87 in year 2. A total of 1493 participants (10,040 player hours) were in the control group, 1128 participants (8170 player hours) were assigned to the standard headgear group, and 1474 participants (10,650 player hours) were assigned to the modified headgear group. The compliance rates were low in all groups, but 46% of participants wore standard headgear. An intention-to-treat analysis showed no differences in the rates of head injury or concussion between controls and headgear arms. Incidence rate ratios for standard headgear wearers referenced to controls were 0.95 and 1.02 for game and missed game injuries. Analyses of injury rates based on observed wearing patterns also showed no significant differences. Incidence rate ratios for standard headgear wearers referenced to nonwearers were 1.11 and 1.10 for game and missed game injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Padded headgear does not reduce the rate of head injury or concussion. The low compliance rates are a limitation. Although individuals may choose to wear padded headgear, the routine or mandatory use of protective headgear cannot be recommended."]}
{"question": "Spinal subdural hematoma: a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Ruptured intracranial aneurysms are often associated with subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. However, the prevalence of subdural hemorrhage post aneurysmal rupture is low and rarely reported in scientific studies. Here, we report an unusual case of a ruptured posterior communicating artery aneurysm resulting in an isolated subdural hematoma located in the tentorial and spinal canal without subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case, a 34-year-old woman with no history of trauma or coagulopathy was diagnosed with a subdural hematoma in the tentorium cerebellum tracing to the subdural space of the spinal column. Computed tomography angiography was used to identify the source of the bleeding, which revealed a ruptured left-sided posterior communicating artery saccular aneurysm. The aneurysm was clipped, and the hematoma was evacuated. The patient recovered without any neurological complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a diagnosis of ruptured intracranial aneurysm should be considered in patients with nontraumatic subdural hematoma. Prompt diagnostic imaging and interventional diagnostic procedures are required to ensure proper management of these patients and to avoid unnecessary complications.", "BACKGROUND: Spinal subdural hematoma (SDH) secondary to intracranial aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) occurs rarely and can cause neurologic deficits. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 52-year-old man was diagnosed with SAH caused by rupture of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was treated by coil embolization on the day of admission. After embolization, the patient's left lower extremity strength had decreased and a spinal magnetic resonance imaging showed subarachnoid hematoma and SDH with severe thecal sac compression at L4-S2. On postbleed day 6, L4-S1 laminectomy was performed, and the strength in all muscle of the left leg improved. CONCLUSIONS: Rupture of an intracranial aneurysm may cause symptomatic SDH in the lumbosacral spine as well as subarachnoid hematoma.", "BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: We describe an unusual presentation of a ruptured aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery with an acute intracranial hematoma between the dural layers associated with an acute spinal epidural hematoma descending to L1. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old woman presented 3 hours after ictus with a postcoital headache, neck stiffness, and bilateral abducens cranial nerve palsy. No other neurological deficits were present. Clinically, she had a subarachnoid hemorrhage World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade 1. CT scan demonstrates an acute subdural hematoma, extending from the right parasellar region, around the clivus, tentorium, and falx. Angio-CT showed a posterior communicating artery aneurysm and an anterior communicating artery aneurysm and an extension of the hematoma to the cervical spine. This justified a spinal and cerebral MRI that confirmed an extension of the hematoma to the epidural space at the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar levels. Three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography confirmed aneurysms on the right posterior communicating artery and on the anterior communicating artery. Both aneurysms were completely occluded by coiling. With reference to the concept of the cranial subdural compartment described in studies conducted using an electron microscope, this group of hematomas was classified as interdural. CONCLUSION: Ruptured aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery may cause cranial acute interdural hematoma with a typical subarachnoid hemorrhage clinical presentation, and it rarely can extend to spinal epidural space.", "BACKGROUND: A case of spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) because of a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm is described. Such a case has never been reported. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 52-year-old woman underwent a craniotomy for a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm. A computed tomography scan showed that SAH existed predominantly in the posterior fossa and subdural hematoma beneath the cerebellar tentorium. Intrathecal administration of urokinase, IV administration of fasudil hydrochloride, and continuous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evacuation via cisternal drainage were performed as prophylactic treatments for vasospasm. On the sixth postoperative day, the patient complained of severe lower back and buttock pain. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a subdural hematoma in the lumbosacral region. Although the mass effect was extensive, the patient showed no neurologic symptoms other than the sciatica. She was treated conservatively. The hematoma dissolved gradually and had diminished completely 15 weeks later. Her pain gradually subsided, and she was discharged 7 weeks later without any neurologic deficit. CONCLUSION: Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "Acute spontaneous subdural hematoma without the presence of a subarachnoid hemorrhage as a result of a ruptured aneurysm is rare. We present the case of a patient with an aneurysm of the intrasellar anterior communicating artery that caused hemorrhage solely into the subdural space. The hemorrhage then migrated down the spinal canal. Our case is unique because all these 3 rare processes occurred in a single patient. Identification of the cause of this type of hemorrhage in a timely fashion is crucial to the management of such a patient."]}
{"question": "Can shape analysis differentiate free-floating internal carotid artery thrombus from atherosclerotic plaque in patients evaluated with CTA for stroke or transient ischemic attack?", "retrieved_passages": ["RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Patients presenting with transient ischemic attack or stroke may have symptom-related lesions on acute computed tomography angiography (CTA) such as free-floating intraluminal thrombus (FFT). It is difficult to distinguish FFT from carotid plaque, but the distinction is critical as management differs. By contouring the shape of these vascular lesions (\"virtual endarterectomy\"), advanced morphometric analysis can be performed. The objective of our study is to determine whether quantitative shape analysis can accurately differentiate FFT from atherosclerotic plaque. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 23 consecutive cases of suspected carotid FFT seen on CTA (13 men, 65 +/- 10 years; 10 women, 65.5 +/- 8.8 years). True-positive FFT cases (FFT+) were defined as filling defects resolving with anticoagulant therapy versus false-positives (FFT-), which remained unchanged. Lesion volumes were extracted from CTA images and quantitative shape descriptors were computed. The five most discriminative features were used to construct receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and to generate three machine-learning classifiers. Average classification accuracy was determined by cross-validation. RESULTS: Follow-up imaging confirmed sixteen FFT+ and seven FFT- cases. Five shape descriptors delineated FFT+ from FFT- cases. The logistic regression model produced from combining all five shape features demonstrated a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 71.4% with an area under the ROC curve = 0.85 +/- 0.09. Average accuracy for each classifier ranged from 65.2%-76.4%. CONCLUSIONS: We identified five quantitative shape descriptors of carotid FFT. This shape \"signature\" shows potential for supplementing conventional lesion characterization in cases of suspected FFT.", "BACKGROUND: Carotid free-floating thrombi (FFT) in patients with acute transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/stroke have a high risk of early recurrent stroke. Management depends on aetiology, which can include local plaque rupture, dissection, coagulopathy, malignancy and cardioembolism. Our objectives were to classify the underlying aetiology of FFT and to estimate the proportion of patients with underlying stenosis requiring revascularisation. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients presenting to three comprehensive stroke centres with acute TIA/stroke and ipsilateral internal carotid artery FFT. The aetiology of FFT was classified as: carotid atherosclerotic disease, carotid dissection, cardioembolism, both carotid atherosclerosis and cardioembolism, or embolic stroke of uncertain source (ESUS). Patients with carotid atherosclerosis were further subclassified as having >/=50% or <50% stenosis. RESULTS: We enrolled 83 patients with confirmed FFT. Aetiological assessments revealed 66/83 (79.5%) had carotid atherosclerotic plaque, 4/83 (4.8%) had a carotid dissection, 10/83 (12%) had both atrial fibrillation and carotid atherosclerotic plaque and 3/83 (3.6%) were classified as ESUS. Of the 76 patients with atherosclerotic plaque (including those with atrial fibrillation), 40 (52.6%) had >/=50% ipsilateral stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of symptomatic carotid artery FFT are likely caused by local plaque rupture, more than half of which are associated with moderate to severe carotid stenosis requiring revascularisation. However, a significant number of FFTs are caused by non-atherosclerotic mechanisms warranting additional investigations.", "A fifth of all strokes and transient ischaemic attacks occur in the posterior circulation arterial territory. Diagnosis can be challenging, in part because of substantial overlap in symptoms and signs with ischaemia in the anterior circulation. Improved methods of non-invasive imaging of the vertebrobasilar arterial tree have been used in recent prospective follow-up studies, which have shown a high risk of early recurrent stroke, particularly when there is associated vertebrobasilar stenosis. This finding emphasises the importance of urgent secondary prevention, and the role of stenting for vertebral stenosis is being investigated.", "Ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack are of particular interest to the vascular surgeon as over one-third of all strokes are caused by thromboembolism from a stenotic carotid artery, making carotid artery stenosis the leading cause of stroke. If detected early, stenosis can be managed medically, surgically or endovascularly. However, treatment decisions depend on the timing of the transient ischaemic attack and the degree of stenosis, and must be balanced against procedural risk. This article discusses the evidence outlining the epidemiology, measurement and surgical management of carotid artery stenosis that inform national guidelines. Vascular and non-vascular trainees should understand these guidelines because of the potentially debilitating or fatal consequences of untreated carotid stenosis.", "OBJECTIVE: The present study was performed to identify the individual clinical features and risk factors most strongly associated with the diagnosis of transient neurological symptoms with a cerebrovascular cause (transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke), as compared to common TIA mimics (including retinal ischaemia, migraine and seizure). METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, consecutive patients presenting with transient neurological symptoms to TIA clinic in Royal Adelaide Hospital were included. Clinical features and risk factors were recorded in a standardised form, categorised into subgroups, and analysed using descriptive statistics and diagnostic performance indicators, such as sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios. RESULTS: For 218/1273 individuals diagnosed with stroke, the three features with the highest positive likelihood ratio were the presence of diffusion weighted imaging positive lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (23.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.35-51.08), extracranial carotid atherosclerosis (3.98, 95% CI 1.19-6.87) and a history of peripheral vascular disease (3.33, 95% CI 1.64-6.27). For TIA, the three features with the highest positive likelihood ratio were extracranial carotid atherosclerosis (3.98, 95% CI 1.19-8.27), presence of atrial fibrillation (2.43, 95% CI 1.54-3.46) and pre-existing anticoagulant therapy (2.39, 95% CI 1.61-3.29). For stroke and TIA, the respective features with the lowest negative likelihood ratios were limb weakness (0.71, 95% CI 0.65-0.77) and hypertension (0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.84). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that specific clinical features and risk factors were associated with the final diagnosis at TIA clinic. These clinical features may assist with diagnosis of TIA in centres without access to a vascular neurologist."]}
{"question": "Is there a role for endothelin-1 in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The hemodynamic significance of elevated endothelin-1 (ET) plasma levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients is unknown. Therefore, we studied the role of ET in the regulation of vascular tone in normotensive HD patients and matched healthy controls (C). METHODS: The forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to adenosine, norepinephrine, the ET-A receptor antagonist BQ-123 (40 nmol/min), the ET-B receptor antagonist BQ-788 (1 and 50 nmol/min), and ET (5 pmol/min) were measured. Results are percent of baseline change +/- SEM (baseline = 100%). RESULTS: Responses to adenosine and norepinephrine were both unchanged in HD. In HD, BQ-123 increased FBF less than in C (133 +/- 9 vs. 178 +/- 27%; P = 0.02). BQ-788 failed to change FBF in C but decreased FBF to 83 +/- 4% in HD. Compared to BQ-123 alone, BQ-123 plus BQ-788 (50 nmol/min) caused an additional increase of FBF (234 +/- 32%, P < 0.001) in C, but not in HD (139 +/- 14%). This additional increase was absent when BQ-788 was co-infused at 1 nmol/min. ET reduced FBF comparably in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance vessels of HD patients have unremarkable contractile properties, as shown by responses to adenosine and norepinephrine. In HD, the basal vascular ET-mediated tone is reduced. The main action of the ET-B receptor in C is vasoconstrictive, which also is blunted in HD. The intact response to exogenous ET indicates the normal function of ET receptors in HD. Our results could be explained by a reduced generation or reduced metabolic clearance rate of ET in normotensive HD patients. Controversy remains concerning the role of the ET-B receptor when comparing the present data with previously published literature."]}
{"question": "Do risk factors for suicidal behavior differ by affective disorder polarity?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Suicide is a leading cause of death and has been strongly associated with affective disorders. The influence of affective disorder polarity on subsequent suicide attempts or completions and any differential effect of suicide risk factors by polarity were assessed in a prospective cohort. METHOD: Participants with major affective disorders in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study (CDS) were followed prospectively for up to 25 years. A total of 909 participants meeting prospective diagnostic criteria for major depressive and bipolar disorders were followed through 4204 mood cycles. Suicidal behavior was defined as suicide attempts or completions. Mixed-effects, grouped-time survival analysis assessed risk of suicidal behavior and differential effects of risk factors for suicidal behavior by polarity. In addition to polarity, the main effects of age, gender, hopelessness, married status, prior suicide attempts and active substance abuse were modeled, with mood cycle as the unit of analysis. RESULTS: After controlling for age of onset, there were no differences in prior suicide attempts by polarity although bipolar participants had more prior severe attempts. During follow-up, 40 cycles ended in suicide and 384 cycles contained at least one suicide attempt. Age, hopelessness and active substance abuse but not polarity predicted suicidal behavior. The effects of risk factors did not differ by polarity. CONCLUSIONS: Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that patients with bipolar disorder (BPD) differ demographically and clinically within subgroups based on the predominant-polarity of major recurrences. METHOD: We tested factors for association with predominantly (>/=2 : 1) depressive vs. mania-like episodes with 928 DSM-IV type-I BPD subjects from five international sites. RESULTS: Factors preliminarily associated with predominant-depression included: electroconvulsive treatment, longer latency-to-BPD diagnosis, first episode depressive or mixed, more suicide attempts, more Axis-II comorbidity, ever having mixed-states, ever married, and female sex. Predominant-mania was associated with: initial manic or psychotic episodes, more drug abuse, more education, and more family psychiatric history. Of the 47.3% of subjects without polarity-predominance, risks for all factors considered were intermediate. Expanding the definition of polarity-predominance to >/=51% added little, but shifting mixed-states to 'predominant-depression' increased risk of suicidal acts from 2.4- to 4.5-fold excess over predominant-mania-hypomania, and suicidal risk was associated continuously with increasing proportions of depressive or mixed episodes. CONCLUSION: Subtyping by predominant-polarity yielded predictive associations, including the polarity of first episodes and risk of suicide attempts. Such subtyping may contribute to improve planning of clinical care and to biological studies of BPD.", "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the polarity of the first mood episode may be a marker for suicidal behavior, particularly the violent subtype. METHOD: One hundred and sixty-eight patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder (DSM-IV) were grouped according to type of first episode: depression or manic/hypomanic. Groups were compared for demographic and clinical variables. We performed logistic regression in order to test the association between first episode polarity and suicidal behavior. RESULTS: We found that depressed patients have a lifetime history of more suicide attempts. However, univariate analysis of number of suicide attempts showed that the best model fits the bipolar II subtype (mean square = 15.022; p = 0.010) and lifetime history of psychotic episodes (mean square = 17.359; p = 0.021). Subgrouping the suicide attempts by subtype (violent or non-violent) revealed that manic/hypomanic patients had a greater tendency toward attempting violent suicide (21.2 vs. 14.7%, X(2) = 7.028, p = 0.03). Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed this result. CONCLUSION: Depressed patients had more suicide attempts over time, which could be explained by the higher prevalence of bipolar II subtype in this group, whereas manic/hypomanic patients had a lifelong history of more frequent violent suicide attempts, not explained by any of the variables studied. Our results support the evidence that non-violent suicide attempters and violent suicide attempters tend to belong to different phenotypic groups.", "Bipolar disorders are linked to a high suicidal risk. Many risk factors are identified but it seems relevant to highlight the relationship between suicidal behavior and the different subtypes of bipolar disorder, or the different kinds of outcomes, or the clinical characteristics of a recurrence. A high frequency of depressive episodes in the story of the illness, like in predominant depressive polarity forms, or mixed features during symptomatic recurrences seem to be linked to a higher suicidal risk in the course of the disorder. Underlying mechanisms are yet to be identified. The investigation of these specifics lead into considering specific therapeutic actions based upon the clinical identification of mixed symptomatology during a recurrence for a tailored treatment or a thorough screening and assessment of depressive states during the course of the bipolar illness in order to try to prevent them.", "The present study was designed to shed light on a topic rarely explored and to suggest possible ways to detect risk factors for the presence of suicidal ideation and behaviors in a sample of adult patients with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This study also explored the association between ADHD, affective temperaments, the presence of hypomania symptoms, and suicide risk. We hypothesized that (compared to healthy controls) (1) patients with adult ADHD would report more negative affective temperaments and more hypomania symptoms and (2) that they would have a higher suicide risk. The participants included 63 consecutive adult inpatients (18 women, 45 men) with ADHD and 69 healthy controls (42 women, 22 men). All participants were administered the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS), the Hypomania Check-List-32 (HCL-32), the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), the Temperament Evaluation for Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego (TEMPS-A), and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Forty-six percent of the ADHD patients had an Axis 1 comorbid disorder. ADHD patients (compared to controls) more often reported suicidal ideation (46.0% vs. 5.9%, one-way Fisher exact test p < 0.001; phi = 0.46). ADHD patients and the controls also significantly differed in all the scales administered (with Cohen's d between 0.92-4.70), except for the TEMPS-A Hyperthymia scale. A regression model indicated that ADHD was independently associated with higher scores of a negative temperaments/hypomania factor (Odd Ratio = 14.60) but not with suicidal ideation. A high incidence of suicidal ideation, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and negative affective temperaments was reported in adult ADHD patients, and clinicians should routinely assess risk factors for suicide among these patients."]}
{"question": "PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels can show wide fluctuations when repeatedly measured. Here we investigatewd if: (a) biopsy timing influences the prostate cancer (PC) detection rate in patients with fluctuating PSA (flu-PSA) in comparison with patients with steadily increasing PSA (si-PSA); (b) PSA slope estimated in patients with flu-PSA predicts a different risk of cancer detection; (c) flu-PSA and si-PSA patients develop PC in topographically different sites; (d) the behaviour of pre-operative PSA is an expression of a disease with defferent characteristics to the following radical prostatectomy. METHODS: The study involved 211 patients who underwent at least a second biopsy after a first negative prostate biopsy. PSA Slope, PSA velocity (PSAV) and PSA doubling time (PSADT) were estimated. Flu-PSA level was defined as a PSA series with at least one PSA value lower than the one immediately preceding it. RESULTS: 82 patients had flu-PSA levels and 129 si-PSA levels. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of cancer detection, clinical or pathological stage, but the si-PSA group with cancer had a higher Gleason score. No difference was found for PSA Slope between flu-PSA patients with cancer and those without. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates no difference in PC detection rate at repeat biopsy between patients with flu or si-PSA levels. PSA Slope, PSAV and PSADT were not found helpful tools in cancer detection."]}

The project took place during a 15-month period between January 1, 2016 and March 30, 2017, in 4 critical care units in a university medical center in Lebanon. The results revealed a reduction in CLABSI rates from a maximum rate of more than 17 per 1000 catheter days to zero per 1000 catheter days, which was sustained for 10 months.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether this rate reduction is sustainable for at least 1 year and to identify key determinants of this sustainability at the NICU of the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center. METHODS: We reviewed the incidence of CLABSIs in the NICU temporally to the implementation of new practice policies and procedures, from July 2008 to December 2013. RESULTS: Adoption of standardized care practices, including bundles and checklists, was associated with a significant reduction of the CLABSI rate to zero for >370 consecutive days in our NICU in 2012. Overall, our CLABSI rates decreased from 4.1 per 1000 line days in 2009 (13 infections; 3163 line days) to 0.94 in 2013 (2 infections; 2115 line days), which represents a 77% reduction over a 5-year period. In the first quarter of 2013, there was a brief increase in CLABSI rate to 3.3 per 1000 line days; after a series of interventions, the CLABSI rate was maintained at zero for >600 days. Ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance with catheter insertion and maintenance practices and improved documentation were identified as key drivers for success.

However, the use of these catheters can result in serious bloodstream infections. The rate of Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infection (CLABSI) in Adult Intensive Care Units (ICUs) at King Abdulaziz Medical City Jeddah (KAMC-J) at the start of the project was 2.0/1000 line days in 2008. The Central Line (CL) Bundle by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI) was implemented at the same time with monitoring of compliance to the CL Bundle. The compliance to CL Bundle was very low at 37% in the same period. A multidisciplinary team was created to improve the compliance to the CL bundle which was expected to have an impact on the rate of CLABSI to achieve zero CLABSI events. The team continued to monitor and evaluate the progress on the compliance to the bundle as well as monitoring the CLABSI events using National Healthcare Safety Network diagnostic criteria. The real reduction in the rate of CLABSI was achieved in 2010 with 0.7/1,000 device days when the compliance to CL Bundle reached up to 98% in that year and 100% in the next two subsequent years. The project still continued and the rate continued to drop and the ultimate target of zero CLABSI was achieved in the year 2014 and maintained in the year 2015 with a sustained compliance of 100% to the CL Bundle. Successful implementation of CL Bundle can help in reducing the rates of CLABSI and achieving zero CLABSI events for a sustained period."]}
{"question": "Is breast cancer prognosis inherited?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: A genetic component is well established in the etiology of breast cancer. It is not well known, however, whether genetic traits also influence prognostic features of the malignant phenotype. METHODS: We carried out a population-based cohort study in Sweden based on the nationwide Multi-Generation Register. Among all women with breast cancer diagnosed from 1961 to 2001, 2,787 mother-daughter pairs and 831 sister pairs with breast cancer were identified; we achieved complete follow-up and classified 5-year breast cancer-specific prognosis among proband (mother or oldest sister) into tertiles as poor, intermediary, or good. We used Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival proportions and Cox models to calculate relative risks of dying from breast cancer within 5 years depending on the proband's outcome. RESULTS: The 5-year survival proportion among daughters whose mothers died within 5 years was 87% compared to 91% if the mother was alive (p = 0.03). Among sisters, the corresponding proportions were 70% and 88%, respectively (p = 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, daughters and sisters of a proband with poor prognosis had a 60% higher 5-year breast cancer mortality compared to those of a proband with good prognosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 2.2; p for trend 0.002). This association was slightly stronger among sisters (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.4) than among daughters (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.3). CONCLUSION: Breast cancer prognosis of a woman predicts the survival in her first-degree relatives with breast cancer. Our novel findings suggest that breast cancer prognosis might be inherited.", "Hereditary breast cancer syndromes affect a small (10-15% of cases) but significant group of patients. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most familiar and well-studied genes associated with inherited breast cancer. However, mutations in the high-penetrance genes, TP53, PTEN, CDH1, MSH1, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2, PALB2, and STK11, and in the moderate-penetrance genes, CHEK2, ATM, and BRIP1, also correlate with high lifetime risks of breast cancer and other malignancies as well. Advances in breast cancer genetics have led to an improved perception of diagnosis and screening strategies. The specific considerations and challenges involved in treating this unique population have become a fertile ground for research. Indeed, these genes and downstream molecular pathways have now become potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer patients, including those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This review describes the variety of hereditary breast cancer genes, from their molecular origins to the prognosis and multidisciplinary clinical decision-making processes. Key publications and other reported recent clinical trials and guidelines are provided.", "Large proportions of hereditary breast cancers are due to mutations in the two breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Considerable effort has gone into studying the function(s) of these tumor suppressor genes, both in attempts to better understand why individuals with these inherited mutations acquire breast (and ovarian) cancer and to potentially develop better treatment strategies. The advent of tools such as cDNA microarrays has enabled researchers to study global gene expression patterns in, for example, primary tumors, thus providing more comprehensive overviews of tumor development and progression. Our recent study (Hedenfalk et al., 2001) strongly supports the principle that genomic approaches to classification of hereditary breast cancers are possible, and that further studies will likely identify the most significant genes that discriminate between subgroups and may influence prognosis and treatment. A large number of hereditary breast cancer cases cannot be accounted for by mutations in these two genes and are believed to be due to as yet unidentified breast cancer predisposition genes (BRCAx). Subclassification of these non-BRCA1/2 breast cancers using cDNA microarray-based gene expression profiling, followed by linkage analysis and/or investigation of genomic alterations, may help in the recognition of novel breast cancer predisposition loci. To summarize, gene expression-based analysis of hereditary breast cancer can potentially be used for classification purposes, as well as to expand upon our knowledge of differences between different forms of hereditary breast cancer. Initial studies indicate that a patient's genotype does in fact leave an identifiable trace on her/his cancer's gene expression profile.", "Hereditary breast cancer is known for its strong tendency of inheritance. Most hereditary breast cancers are related to BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variants. The lifelong risk of breast cancer in pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant carriers is approximately 65% and 45%, respectively, whereas that of ovarian cancer is estimated to be 39% and 11%, respectively. Therefore, understanding these variants and clinical knowledge on their occurrence in breast cancers and carriers are important. BRCA1 pathogenic variant breast cancer shows more aggressive clinicopathological features than the BRCA2 pathogenic variant breast cancer. Compared with sporadic breast cancer, their prognosis is still debated. Treatments of BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variant breast cancer are similar to those for BRCA-negative breast cancer, mainly including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Recently, various clinical trials have investigated poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor treatment for advanced-stage BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variant breast cancer. Among the various PARP inhibitors, olaparib and talazoparib, which reached phase III clinical trials, showed improvement of median progression-free survival around three months. Preventive and surveillance strategies for BRCA pathogenic variant breast cancer to reduce cancer recurrence and improve treatment outcomes have recently received increasing attention. In this review, we provide an information on the clinical features of BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variant breast cancer and clinical recommendations for BRCA pathogenic variant carriers, with a focus on treatment and prevention strategies. With this knowledge, clinicians could manage the BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variant breast cancer patients more effectively.", "BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that prognosis in familial breast cancer could be influenced by the parent of origin, with a worse prognosis when inherited paternally. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the parent of origin on prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Index patients were divided into two study groups depending on the parent of origin. Tumour characteristics and survival data for index patients were collected. RESULTS: In total, 319 families fulfilled the inclusion criteria. No significant difference in overall or recurrence-free survival between those with maternal and those with paternal inheritance was observed, with hazard ratios (HR) of 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.54 to 1.80, p=0.97) and 1.22 (95% CI=0.78 to 1.92, p=0.38), respectively. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence for a worse prognosis in patients with paternally inherited breast cancer. However, only large differences in prognosis were excluded and the tendency for worse recurrence-free survival in the group with paternal inheritance therefore merits further study."]}

Preferential transmission of the number of AVPR1A microsatellite repeats to hypersexual and uninhibited people-seeking probands was hypothesized, based on reports from preclinical work in the literature. METHODS: Probands were 83 participants in an ongoing controlled study of PEA-BP. The PEA-BP phenotype was defined by DSM-IV mania with at least one of the cardinal symptoms of mania (elation and/or grandiosity) to avoid diagnosing mania only by symptoms that overlapped with those for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Comprehensive assessment of the probands included separate Washington University in St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (WASH-U-KSADS) interviews of parents about their children and of children about themselves. Hypersexuality and uninhibited people-seeking were assessed from the corresponding WASH-U-KSADS items. Microsatellite genotyping of the AVPR1A repeats was conducted using fluorescently labeled primers and detected by laser-induced fluorescence. Alleles were determined with the assistance of semi-automated allele-calling software. There were 32 complete, biological trios (28 informative families) for the GATA repeat and 34 complete, biological trios (30 informative families) for the complex repeat. Data were analyzed using case-control and family-based association methods. RESULTS: Preferential transmission of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats was not significant for hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking, using the transmission disequilibrium test. Similarly, case-control analyses found no significant associations between hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking and the number of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats. For p < 0.05, there was about 80% power to detect odds ratios of 5.0 and 4.0 (in the family-based analyses) and 3.5 and 2.6 (in the case-control analyses), for allele frequencies of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively. CONCLUSION: Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported."]}
{"question": "Does Residency Selection Criteria Predict Performance in Orthopaedic Surgery Residency?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: More than 1000 candidates applied for orthopaedic residency positions in 2014, and the competition is intense; approximately one-third of the candidates failed to secure a position in the match. However, the criteria used in the selection process often are subjective and studies have differed in terms of which criteria predict either objective measures or subjective ratings of resident performance by faculty. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Do preresidency selection factors serve as predictors of success in residency? Specifically, we asked which preresidency selection factors are associated or correlated with (1) objective measures of resident knowledge and performance; and (2) subjective ratings by faculty. METHODS: Charts of 60 orthopaedic residents from our institution were reviewed. Preresidency selection criteria examined included United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 scores, Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores, number of clinical clerkship honors, number of letters of recommendation, number of away rotations, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical society membership, fourth-year subinternship at our institution, and number of publications. Resident performance was assessed using objective measures including American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I scores and Orthopaedics In-Training Exam (OITE) scores and subjective ratings by faculty including global evaluation scores and faculty rankings of residents. We tested associations between preresidency criteria and the subsequent objective and subjective metrics using linear correlation analysis and Mann-Whitney tests when appropriate. RESULTS: Objective measures of resident performance namely, ABOS Part I scores, had a moderate linear correlation with the USMLE Step 2 scores (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and number of clinical honors received in medical school (r = 0.45, p < 0.001). OITE scores had a weak linear correlation with the number of clinical honors (r = 0.35, p = 0.009) and USMLE Step 2 scores (r = 0.29, p = 0.02). With regards to subjective outcomes, AOA membership was associated with higher scores on the global evaluation (p = 0.005). AOA membership also correlated with higher global evaluation scores (r = 0.60, p = 0.005) with the strongest correlation existing between AOA membership and the \"interpersonal and communication skills\" subsection of the global evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "The objective of this study was to determine which criteria in the residency application had the highest correlation with subsequent performance of orthopaedic residents. Data collected from the application files of 58 residents included scores on standardized tests, number of honors grades in the basic and clinical years of medical school, election to Alpha Omega Alpha, numbers of research projects and publications, and numbers of extracurricular activities. Measures of performance included scores on the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination and American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery Part I Examination, and faculty evaluations of overall, cognitive, affective, and psychomotor performance. The number of honors grades on clinical rotations was the strongest predictor of performance, whereas election to Alpha Omega Alpha was second. The only other significant correlation was between the number of fine motor activities and psychomotor performance. None of the predictor variables had a significant correlation with Orthopaedic In-Training Examination or American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery Examination scores. Consistency between faculty rankings in each of the four categories was supported by regression analysis. From the results of this study, it appears that academic performance in clinical clerkships in medical school is the most predictive of resident performance. Range restriction in the data available for orthopaedic residency applicants, however, likely precludes the development of a reliable model to assist in the selection of orthopaedic residents.", "The ability to accurately screen and select orthopaedic resident applicants with eventual successful outcomes has been historically difficult. Many preresidency selection variables are subjective in nature and a more standardized objective scoring method seems desirable. A quantitative composite scoring tool (QCST) to be used in a standardized manner to help predict orthopaedic residency performance from application materials was developed. In 64 orthopaedic residents, four predictors (United States Medical Licensing Examination [USMLE] Part I scores, Alpha Omega Alpha status, junior year clinical clerkship honors grades, and the QCST score) were analyzed with respect to four residency outcomes assessments. The outcomes included three standardized assessments, the orthopaedic in-training examination scores (OITE), the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) written and oral examinations, and an internal outcomes assessment, attainment of satisfactory chief resident associate (CRA) status. Collectively, the QCST score had the strongest association as a predictor for all three standardized outcomes assessments (p < 0.001). Honors grades during junior years clinical clerkships was most strongly associated with satisfactory CRA status (p < 0.001). A composite scoring tool that is an effective predictor of orthopaedic resident outcomes can be developed. Additional work is still required to refine this scoring tool for orthopaedic residency screening and selection.", "Selection of orthopaedic residents can be a difficult process; we have endeavored to make it more objective by developing a scoring methodology for screening applications. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if an academic score, using objective elements only, will discriminate among applicants and will correlate with outcomes. Applications to our orthopaedic residency program for 2004 and 2005 were assigned an academic score as a screening tool in the residency selection process. Data was analyzed for the entire group both by gender and whether the applicant had interviewed for the program. Additionally, the applications of program graduates over the past 5 years were retrospectively assigned academic scores, which were compared with outcomes of the training program. Academic scores for applicants formed a generally normal distribution, and residents training in the program generally had higher scores. The distribution of scores for female applicants was similar to male applicants; however, a greater percentage of female applicants interviewed for the program. Scores on the OITE and ABOS examinations tended to parallel academic scores, but faculty ratings of performance in the program showed no difference between those with high and low academic scores. Calculating academic scores makes the application screening process more objective but does not appear to correlate with outcomes of the training program.", "BACKGROUND: The US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE) are commonly used to select medical students or residents, respectively. Knowing how well these examinations predict performance on the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I certifying examination is important to provide evaluations for medical students and residents. Previous studies comparing the OITE scores with the ABOS Part 1 scores have been limited to one program. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Therefore, we compared the scores on the USMLE Step 1 and OITE examinations with those on the ABOS Part I certifying examination using data from four ACGME approved residency programs. METHODS: We reviewed 202 resident files from 1996 to 2008 from four programs in the same geographic region. Of those, 181 (90%) had complete records. De-identified data were used to compare USMLE Step 1 scores, OITE percentile rank scores, and ABOS Part I percentile rank scores. Pearson coefficients and receiver operator curves were calculated to assess the relationships between tests. RESULTS: We found a correlation of 0.53 between the USMLE Step 1 and ABOS Part I, and an average correlation of 0.50 for postgraduate years (PGY) 2 through 5 OITE scores and ABOS Part I. There was a stepwise increase in correlation from PGY 2 through PGY 5 between the OITE scores and ABOS scores. Those who averaged in the 27th percentile or lower on the OITE had a 57% chance of failing the ABOS Part I examination. CONCLUSION: USMLE Step 1 scores correlated with ABOS Part I certifying examination scores, and we therefore believe it may be used as one factor in resident selection. Use of the OITE scores in guiding education and feedback appears to be justified."]}
{"question": "Optimism and survival: does an optimistic outlook predict better survival at advanced ages?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies examining predictors of survival among the oldest-old have primarily focused on objective measures, such as physical function and health status. Only a few studies have examined the effect of personality traits on survival, such as optimism. The aim of this study was to examine whether an optimistic outlook predicts survival among the oldest-old. METHODS: The Danish 1905 Cohort Survey is a nationwide, longitudinal survey comprising all individuals born in Denmark in 1905. At baseline in 1998, a total of 2,262 persons aged 92 or 93 agreed to participate in the intake survey. The baseline in-person interview consisted of a comprehensive questionnaire including physical functioning and health, and a question about whether the respondent had an optimistic, neutral or pessimistic outlook on his or her own future. RESULTS: During the follow-up period of 12 years (1998-2010) there were 2,239 deaths (99 %) in the 1905 Cohort Survey. Univariable analyses revealed that optimistic women and men were at lower risk of death compared to their neutral counterparts [HR 0.82, 95 % CI (0.73-0.93) and 0.81, 95 % CI (0.66-0.99), respectively]. When confounding factors such as baseline physical and cognitive functioning and disease were taken into account the association between optimism and survival weakened in both sexes, but the general pattern persisted. Optimistic women were still at lower risk of death compared to neutral women [HR 0.85, 95 % CI (0.74-0.97)]. The risk of death was also decreased for optimistic men compared to their neutral counterparts, but the effect was non-significant [HR 0.91, 95 % CI (0.73-1.13)]. CONCLUSION: An optimistic outlook appears to be a significant predictor of survival among the oldest-old women. It may also be a significant predictor for men but the sample size is small."]}
{"question": "Is it better to be big?", "retrieved_passages": ["An important cultural question is, \"What is a 'good'--desirable, beautiful, impressive--body?\" The answers are legion; here I examine why bigger bodies represent survival skill, and how this power symbolism is embodied by behaviors that guide larger persons toward the top of the social hierarchy. bigness is a complex concept comprising tallness, boniness, muscularity and fattiness. Data show that most people worldwide want to be big--both tall and fat. Those who achieve the ideal are disproportionately among the society's most socially powerful. In the food-secure West, fascination with power and the body has not waned, but has been redefined such that thinness is desired. This apparent anomaly is resolved by realizing that thinness in the midst of abundance--as long as one is also tall and muscular--still projects the traditional message of power, and brings such social boons as upward mobility.", "With the increasingly widespread collection and processing of \"big data,\" there is natural interest in using these data assets to improve decision making. One of the best understood ways to use data to improve decision making is via predictive analytics. An important, open question is: to what extent do larger data actually lead to better predictive models? In this article we empirically demonstrate that when predictive models are built from sparse, fine-grained data-such as data on low-level human behavior-we continue to see marginal increases in predictive performance even to very large scale. The empirical results are based on data drawn from nine different predictive modeling applications, from book reviews to banking transactions. This study provides a clear illustration that larger data indeed can be more valuable assets for predictive analytics. This implies that institutions with larger data assets-plus the skill to take advantage of them-potentially can obtain substantial competitive advantage over institutions without such access or skill. Moreover, the results suggest that it is worthwhile for companies with access to such fine-grained data, in the context of a key predictive task, to gather both more data instances and more possible data features. As an additional contribution, we introduce an implementation of the multivariate Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm that can scale to massive, sparse data.", "BACKGROUND: The current approaches to assess growth are limited to anthropometry, are insensitive and nonspecific, and do not enable an improved understanding of how nutrition might impact growth. Consequently, new tools to develop better standards of care and programs to address ongoing concerns about nutrition and health are needed. METHODS: The Biomarkers of Nutrition for Development (BOND) project is designed to support the discovery, development, and use of current and new biomarkers of nutritional exposure, status, function, and effect. The Biomarkers in Growth (BIG) project was initiated as a BOND program to develop a roadmap for moving the nutrition and growth agenda forward. The first step in this project was a session jointly organized by the BOND Secretariat and Sight and Life at the 20th International Congress on Nutrition in Granada, Spain. RESULTS: The BIG session outlined current approaches to evaluating growth and understanding of the role of nutrition in linear growth, body composition, and long-term health outcomes and the potential role of systems biology in the assessment of the nutrition-growth relationship. CONCLUSION: The session presentations and deliberations highlighted the need for a concerted effort to address the critical gaps in our understanding of the biology and assessment of growth.", "The amount of available data is continuously growing. This phenomenon promotes a new concept, named big data. The highlight technologies related to big data are cloud computing (infrastructure) and Not Only SQL (NoSQL; data storage). In addition, for data analysis, machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and clustering techniques present promising results. In a biological context, big data has many applications due to the large number of biological databases available. Some limitations of biological big data are related to the inherent features of these data, such as high degrees of complexity and heterogeneity, since biological systems provide information from an atomic level to interactions between organisms or their environment. Such characteristics make most bioinformatic-based applications difficult to build, configure, and maintain. Although the rise of big data is relatively recent, it has contributed to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of life. The main goal of this article is to provide a concise and reliable survey of the application of big data-related technologies in biology. As such, some fundamental concepts of information technology, including storage resources, analysis, and data sharing, are described along with their relation to biological data.", "Numerous studies and meta-analyses have now confirmed that personality traits tend to correlate such that a general factor of personality (GFP) emerges. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate about what these correlations, and therefore the GFP, represents. One interpretation is that the GFP reflects a substantive factor that indicates general social effectiveness or emotional intelligence. Another interpretation is that the GFP merely is an artifact based on measurement or response bias. In the present paper, we elaborate on a selection of topics that are central to the debate about this construct. Specifically, we discuss (a) the GFP in relation to more specific personality dimensions (e.g., Big Five, facets), (b) the validity of the GFP and under what circumstances it seems to 'disappear', and (c) the theoretical and practical relevance of the general factor. Overall, the review should provide insight into the nature of the GFP and whether or not it represents a meaningful factor that can contribute to a better understanding of personality."]}
{"question": "Is arch form influenced by sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Orthodontic patients show high prevalence of tooth-size discrepancy. This study investigates the possible association between arch form, clinically significant tooth-size discrepancy, and sagittal molar relationship. METHODS: Pretreatment orthodontic casts of 230 Saudi patients were classified into one of three arch form types (tapered, ovoid, and square) using digitally scanned images of the mandibular arches. Bolton ratio was calculated, sagittal molar relationship was defined according to Angle classification, and correlations were analyzed using ANOVA, chi-square, and t-tests. RESULTS: No single arch form was significantly more common than the others. Furthermore, no association was observed between the presence of significant Bolton discrepancy and the sagittal molar relationship or arch form. Overall Bolton discrepancy is significantly more prevalent in males. CONCLUSIONS: Arch form in a Saudi patient group is independent of gender, sagittal molar relationship, and Bolton discrepancy.", "BACKGROUND: To determine the relationship between clinically significant tooth size discrepancies (TSD) and archform classification in orthodontic patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty teeth with artificial white spot lesions were randomly divided into four groups: (A) distilled and deionized water, (B) Nd:YAG laser, (C) CPP-ACP creme, & (D) CPP-ACP plus laser. SMH was measured using Vickers diamond indenter in Vickers Hardness Number (VHN). Two samples of each group were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results were analyzed with the SPSS 17/win. RESULTS: Reproducibility of the classification of archform was very good (unweighted Kappa statistic of 0.83 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.73, 0.93). There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of archform type between group 1 and group 2 for the upper (p=0.3305) or lower (p=0.6310) arches.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data source was CBCT high volumetric data from the archives. Tooth size, arch widths, arch length and arch perimeter were measured in maxilla and mandibular arches. The independent t-test and ANOVA were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: The female Bolton anterior ratio (BAR) (78.373) and Bolton overall ratio (BOR) (93.231) show a greater tooth size ratio in comparison to male BAR (77.162) and BOR (93.124), respectively. However, no significant difference was found in the sexual comparison of all the measurements. Tooth size ratio in arch width groups also showed no significant difference. Significant discrepancies in the arch length (p < 0.05) groups and overall ratio and in the arch perimeter groups (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) and anterior ratio were revealed.

Methods: This study is a biometric analysis of dental casts of 149 young adults recruited from different orthodontic centers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The dental arch dimensions were measured. The measured parameters were arch length, arch width, Bolton's ratio, and arch form. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS software version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, New York, USA); this cross-sectional study was conducted between April 2015 and May 2016. Results: Dental arch measurements, including inter-canine and inter-molar distance, were found to be significantly greater in males than females (p less than 0.05). The most prevalent dental arch forms were narrow tapered (50.3%) and narrow ovoid (34.2%), respectively. The prevalence of tooth size discrepancy in all cases was 43.6% for anterior ratio and 24.8% for overall ratio. The mean Bolton's anterior ratio in all malocclusion classes was 79.81%, whereas the mean Bolton's overall ratio was 92.21%. There was no significant difference between males and females regarding Bolton's ratio. Conclusion: The most prevalent arch form was narrow tapered, followed by narrow ovoid. Males generally had larger dental arch measurements than females, and the prevalence of tooth size discrepancy was more in Bolton's anterior teeth ratio than in overall ratio.", "BACKGROUND: For proper intercuspation, the teeth must be proportional in size. If teeth are mismatched, with unusually large teeth in one arch compared to the other, then an ideal occlusion cannot be attained. This study has been done to determine the prevalence of tooth size discrepancies among orthodontic patients in general and also between different malocclusion groups, sex, and to analyze the change in the degree of severity in Bolton discrepancy before and after the hypothetical premolar extraction. METHODS: The study was carried out on randomly collected 100 pre-treatment dental casts. Tooth size analyses were performed on these pre-treatment models and Mesio distal tooth size ratios were measured as described by Bolton before and after various patterns of hypothetical extraction. RESULT: The results were statistically evaluated using ANOVA and paired samples t-test. 5 out of 100 patients are seen with severe Bolton discrepancy with Bolton values (BV) ranging above and below 2 standard deviation. Statistically insignificant difference is seen between males and females and also between various groups of malocclusion. The difference between the pre-treatment and post extraction BV was found statistically significant for the first premolar extraction and insignificant for others. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate a new point of view to the question of which teeth to extract when evaluated for tooth size aspect only."]}
{"question": "Are pectins involved in cold acclimation and de-acclimation of winter oil-seed rape plants?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The hypothesis was tested that pectin content and methylation degree participate in regulation of cell wall mechanical properties and in this way may affect tissue growth and freezing resistance over the course of plant cold acclimation and de-acclimation. METHODS: Experiments were carried on the leaves of two double-haploid lines of winter oil-seed rape (Brassica napus subsp. oleifera), differing in winter survival and resistance to blackleg fungus (Leptosphaeria maculans). KEY RESULTS: Plant acclimation in the cold (2 degrees C) brought about retardation of leaf expansion, concomitant with development of freezing resistance. These effects were associated with the increases in leaf tensile stiffness, cell wall and pectin contents, pectin methylesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) activity and the low-methylated pectin content, independently of the genotype studied. However, the cold-induced modifications in the cell wall properties were more pronounced in the leaves of the more pathogen-resistant genotype. De-acclimation promoted leaf expansion and reversed most of the cold-induced effects, with the exception of pectin methylesterase activity. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the temperature-dependent modifications in pectin content and their methyl esterification degree correlate with changes in tensile strength of a leaf tissue, and in this way affect leaf expansion ability and its resistance to freezing and to fungus pathogens."]}
{"question": "Does ultrasound imaging before puncture facilitate internal jugular vein cannulation?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether prepuncture ultrasound evaluation of vascular anatomy facilitates internal jugular vein cannulation compared with landmark-guided puncture. DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. SETTING: Single community hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients undergoing general anesthesia (n = 240). INTERVENTIONS: The right internal jugular vein was cannulated using either anatomic landmarks or prepuncture ultrasound (3.75/7.5 MHz) guidance. In the landmark group, respiratory jugular venodilation was used as the primary landmark for locating the vein. Results of cannulation and the incidence of complications were compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to the ultrasound or landmark group. Respiratory jugular venodilation was identified in 188 patients (78.3%), in whom results of cannulation did not differ between the 2 techniques with respect to the venous access rate (cannulated at the first attempt: 83.5% in the landmark v 85.7% in the ultrasound group), the success rate (cannulated within 3 attempts: 96.9% v 95.6%), and the incidence of arterial puncture (1.0% v 3.3%). In the remaining 52 respiratory jugular venodilation-unidentified patients, the access rate (30.4% v 86.2%, p < 0.001) and the success rate (78.3 v 100%, p < 0.05) were significantly better in the ultrasound group, and no arterial puncture was recorded in the ultrasound group, whereas the incidence was 13.0% in the landmark group. The results were similar regardless of the ultrasound frequency used. CONCLUSION: Prepuncture ultrasound evaluation did not improve the result of right internal jugular vein cannulation compared with the respiratory jugular venodilation-guided approach. When the landmark was not observed, however, the prepuncture ultrasound guidance was helpful in facilitating the cannulation.", "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate needle-guided ultrasound for internal jugular venous cannulation in a large university anesthesia department, to determine cumulative cannulation success by method, to determine first-pass cannulation success by method and operator, and to determine arterial puncture by method and operator. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational, and randomized. Blinding was not possible. Cohort size was calculated for 80% power to detect a technique difference, with significance defined as p < 0.05. SETTING: Operating rooms of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS: Elective surgical patients requiring internal jugular venous cannulation. INTERVENTIONS: Cannulation of the internal jugular vein occurred by needle-guided ultrasound (NGU) or by ultrasound without a needle guide. MAIN RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-four procedures were studied in 429 patients. NGU significantly enhances cannulation success after first (68.9%-80.9%, p = 0.0054) and second (80.0%-93.1%, p = 0.0001) needle passes. Cumulative cannulation success by the seventh needle pass is 100%, regardless of technique. The needle-guide specifically improves first-pass success in the junior operator (65.6%-79.8%, p = 0.0144). Arterial puncture averages 4.2%, regardless of technique (p > 0.05) or operator (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although the needle guide facilitates prompt cannulation with ultrasound in the novice operator, it offers no additional protection against arterial puncture. This may be because of a lack of control of needle depth rather than needle direction. A possible solution may be biplanar ultrasound for central venous cannulation.", "OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of an audio-guided Doppler ultrasound device in improving success and decreasing complications in cannulation of the internal jugular vein in high-risk patients. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, crossover clinical study. SETTING: Two major university medical centers in critical care environments. PATIENTS: Seventy-six consecutive, consenting adult patients with preexisting obesity or coagulopathy requiring central venous access. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects enrolled in the study were randomized to receive either the traditional \"blind\" (control) technique or the ultrasonic technique. A maximum of three cannulation attempts were allowed before crossover to three attempts with the alternative technique. All cannulations were attempted via the internal jugular vein through a high/central approach. RESULTS: Patient and operator characteristics were similar between groups. The initial use of an audio-guided ultrasound device was associated with increased success of cannulation (84.4% vs. 61.4%; p < .05) and decreased need to crossover to the alternative technique. Success on the first needle pass was more likely with the ultrasound technique (56.3% vs. 29.5%; p < .05). Significant complications were greater with the control technique (carotid artery puncture 16.3% vs. 2.0% [p < .02]; any significant complication 26.5% vs. 6.1% [p < .01]). CONCLUSIONS: The use of an audio-guided Doppler ultrasound vascular access device was associated with increased success of cannulation and a decreased frequency of significant complications in a population of high-risk patients with obesity or coagulopathy.", "OBJECTIVE: To compare the conventional method for cannulation of the internal jugular vein with the ultrasound-aided technique. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized trial. SETTING: Medical and surgical patients requiring central cannulation in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive medical and surgical patients in whom central venous cannulation was indicated. INTERVENTIONS: Cannulation of the internal jugular vein was performed by one anesthesiologist. During the first 6 months, the ultrasound-aided technique (n = 29) was used, and during the second 6 months, the conventional technique (n = 27) was applied. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The venous lumen was reached with fewer punctures (1.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.3 +/- 3.0 punctures per patient) and the cannulation time was shorter (35 +/- 19 vs. 198 +/- 211 secs) while using the ultrasound-aided technique. The ultrasound-aided method showed that the large-bore (diameter greater than 2.0 mm) needles invariably perforated the medial wall of the internal jugular vein, increasing the risk of perforating the adjacent carotid artery. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound guidance reduces both the duration of time and the number of punctures required to cannulate the internal jugular vein. The Seldinger technique appears safer for catheterization of the internal jugular vein.", "BACKGROUND: The right internal jugular vein as a route for right heart catheterization and continuous infusion of drugs is increasingly used in patients with heart failure. Although this approach has several advantages, a small but definite number of unsuccessful vein punctures and/or of complications have been reported. This prospective study was designed to evaluate the usefulness of ultrasound techniques for cannulating internal jugular vein in a series of 310 consecutive patients with chronic heart failure. METHODS: In all patients a duplex scanning of internal jugular veins was performed before the cannulation. A subgroup of 62 patients was selected for having a \"difficult\" cannulation according to the following criteria: previous failure of cannulating the vein (3 unsuccessful needle advances); neck abnormalities; severe emphysema and respiratory insufficiency. In these patients a Doppler-guidance system, which consisted of a miniature ultrasound Doppler transducer inserted in a standard 19 gauge needle, was used. The needle was advanced under the skin following the maximal audio signal of the venous flow. The following variables were considered: success rate, number of needle advances to cannulate the vein, time elapsed from local anesthesia and the insertion of the catheter, minor and major complications. RESULTS: Duplex scanning showed that in 14 patients (4.5%) the right internal jugular vein was occluded or severely narrowed. In all patients the left internal jugular vein, which showed a compensatory dilatation, was successfully cannulated. In 294 of the remaining 296 patients the position of the vein was anterior to the carotid artery at a depth of 4-27 mm below the skin. With respect of the triangle formed by the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the vein was central in 35%, medial in 15% and lateral in 60% of cases. Based on duplex scanning ultrasound data, 285 patients underwent internal jugular vein cannulation, which was achieved at the first attempt in 74% and within 3 attempts in 87% of cases. Minor and major complications occurred in 4 (1.4%) and in 1 (0.3%) respectively. By the Doppler guidance system, the cannulation was successfully achieved in 79% of patients at the first attempt and in 98% of patients (61/62) within 3 attempts. In one patient an uneventful puncture of the carotid artery occurred. The time to perform the cannulation was not significantly different using the two approaches (conventional approach: 4.4 +/- 3 minutes; Doppler guidance system: 4.2 +/- 2). Overall the internal jugular vein was successfully cannulated in 307/310 patients (99%). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound techniques provide useful information which facilitates the cannulation of the internal jugular vein in patients with heart failure. The Doppler guidance method allows a rapid and safe cannulation of the vein even in cases that are difficult using the conventional approach."]}
{"question": "Should prostate specific antigen be adjusted for body mass index?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Obesity may be associated with lower prostate specific antigen through hemodilution. We examined the relationship between body mass index and prostate specific antigen by age in men without prostate cancer in a longitudinal aging study to determine whether prostate specific antigen must be adjusted for body mass index. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included 994 men (4,937 observations) without prostate cancer in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Mixed effects models were used to examine the relationship between prostate specific antigen and body mass index in kg/m(2) by age. Separate models were explored in men with prostate cancer censored at diagnosis, for percent body fat measurements, for weight changes with time and adjusting for initial prostate size in 483 men (2,523 observations) with pelvic magnetic resonance imaging measurements. RESULTS: In men without prostate cancer body mass index was not significantly associated with prostate specific antigen after adjusting for age (p = 0.06). A 10-point body mass index increase was associated with a prostate specific antigen difference of -0.03 ng/ml (95% CI -0.40-0.49). Results were similar when men with prostate cancer were included, when percent body fat was substituted for body mass index, and after adjusting for prostate volume. Longitudinal weight changes also had no significant association with prostate specific antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "OBJECTIVES: The prostate cancer prevention trial (PCPT) prostate cancer risk calculator was developed to aid physicians in counseling men for consideration of prostate biopsy based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and other clinical risk factors. This study investigated the role of body mass index (BMI) in this assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BMI category was defined as < 25 (under/normal weight), 25.0-29.9 (overweight), 30.0-34.9 (obese [OB] I), 35.0-39.9 (OB II), and >/= 40 (OB III). BMI-adjusted PSA for a man was determined by multiplying his PSA to the ratio of the geometrical mean of PSA for BMI < 25 to the geometrical mean of PSA for his BMI category. Operating characteristics of PSA and BMI-adjusted PSA were compared with PCPT risks using area underneath the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Statistical tests of differences between AUCs for different diagnostic tests were performed with the nonparametric U-statistic method. RESULTS: BMI-adjusted PSA equaled to unadjusted PSA multiplying 1.09, 1.20, 1.50, and 1.71 for men in overweight, OBI, OBII, and OBIII categories, respectively. The AUC for BMI-adjusted PSA values (0.84) did not differ from PSA; that of the PCPT calculator with BMI-adjusted PSA (0.87) did not differ from the calculator with PSA. Of 2816 men with a PSA less than or equal to 2.5 ng/mL who did not undergo biopsy, 126 (4.5%) would have a BMI-adjusted PSA exceeding 2.5 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Because of lower levels of PSA, overweight and obese men may have diminished cancer detection opportunities when undergoing PSA-based screening.", "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in Jamaican men. METHODS: Men, 40-79 years old, attending public and private urology clinics in Kingston, Jamaica were recruited to a case-control study on the role of dietary and lifestyle factors on prostate cancer. Trained interviewers administered questionnaires and measured weight and height using standardized techniques. Blood samples for PSA were measured at a central laboratory using a micro-particle enzyme immunoassay method. Prostate biopsy was used to confirm prostate cancer. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the relationship between BMI and PSA separately in the cases and controls. RESULTS: Data from 501 men (233 cases and 263 controls) were assessed. Thirty-five per cent of subjects were overweight and 13% were obese. Among cases, the median PSA was 35.3 ng/dL in normal weight, 26.1 ng/dL in overweight and 14.5 ng/dL in obese men (p = 0.02). For controls, median PSA was 2.0 ng/dL in normal weight, 1.3 ng/dL in overweight and 1.1ng/dl in obese men (p = 0.01). Among cases, BMI was negatively associated with PSA (B(SE) per 5 kg/m2 (BMI difference = -0.51 (0.13); p < 0.01) and remained significant after adjustment for age, sexual activity, smoking, use of statins and tumour grade. For controls, the BMI was also inversely related to the PSA (B(SE) per 5 kg/m2 difference -0.17 (0.07)) but the effect became of borderline significance after adjusting for age. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate specific antigen was inversely related to body mass index in Jamaican men with prostate cancer. Clinicians should consider this association when interpreting PSA results.", "The possible relationship between body mass index (BMI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations is controversial. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between BMI and PSA concentrations in Chinese men. A total of 81,122 men who had undergone annual medical examinations at the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2018 were included. Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between BMI and PSA concentrations. The nonlinear relationship was analyzed using a generalized additive model with a spline smoothing function. Subsequently, a stratified linear regression model was used for subgroup analysis. The mean age and BMI of the participants were 45.91 +/- 12.21 years and 24.79 +/- 3.11 kg/m(2), respectively. After adjustment for age, waist circumference-hip circumference ratio, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, BMI was negatively related to PSA level (p < .001). A nonlinear relationship was detected, and different relationships between BMI and PSA concentrations were observed on each side of the inflection point (BMI = 23.11 kg/m(2)). Our study revealed an inverse, nonlinear relationship between BMI and PSA concentrations. Thus, this relationship may be a concern when establishing reference intervals or decision limits for PSA concentrations.", "PURPOSE: Previous studies indicate a possible inverse relationship between prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and body mass index (BMI), and a positive relationship between PSA and age. We investigated the associations between age, BMI, PSA, and screen-detected prostate cancer to determine whether an age-BMI-adjusted PSA model would be clinically useful for detecting prostate cancer. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis nested within the UK ProtecT trial of treatments for localized cancer. Of 18,238 men aged 50-69 years, 9,457 men without screen-detected prostate cancer (controls) and 1,836 men with prostate cancer (cases) met inclusion criteria: no history of prostate cancer or diabetes; PSA < 10 ng/ml; BMI between 15 and 50 kg/m(2). Multivariable linear regression models were used to investigate the relationship between log-PSA, age, and BMI in all men, controlling for prostate cancer status. RESULTS: In the 11,293 included men, the median PSA was 1.2 ng/ml (IQR: 0.7-2.6); mean age 61.7 years (SD 4.9); and mean BMI 26.8 kg/m(2) (SD 3.7). There were a 5.1% decrease in PSA per 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI (95% CI 3.4-6.8) and a 13.6% increase in PSA per 5-year increase in age (95% CI 12.0-15.1). Interaction tests showed no evidence for different associations between age, BMI, and PSA in men above and below 3.0 ng/ml (all p for interaction >0.2). The age-BMI-adjusted PSA model performed as well as an age-adjusted model based on National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines at detecting prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Age and BMI were associated with small changes in PSA. An age-BMI-adjusted PSA model is no more clinically useful for detecting prostate cancer than current NICE guidelines. Future studies looking at the effect of different variables on PSA, independent of their effect on prostate cancer, may improve the discrimination of PSA for prostate cancer."]}
{"question": "Does obstructive sleep apnea affect aerobic fitness?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) had an objective change in aerobic fitness during cycle ergometry compared to a normal population. The most accurate test of aerobic fitness is measurement of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) with cycle ergometry. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis (247 patients with OSA) of VO2max from annual cycle ergometry tests compared to a large control group (normative data from 1.4 million US Air Force tests) in a tertiary care setting. RESULTS: Overall, individuals with OSA had increased VO2max when compared to the normalized US Air Force data (p < .001). Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 demonstrated a decreased VO2max as compared to normalized values (p < .001). No differences in VO2max were observed after either medical or surgical therapy for OSA. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "BACKGROUND: Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an important prognostic marker in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) also negatively affects exercise tolerance. However, the impact of their association on CRF has not been evaluated. We hypothesized that patients with overlap syndrome would demonstrate a greater impairment in CRF, particularly those with severe COPD. METHODS: Individuals with COPD were recruited. First, subjects underwent clinical and spirometry evaluation. Next, home-based sleep evaluation was performed. Subjects with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) < 15 episodes/h were allocated to the COPD group and those with an AHI >/= 15 episodes/h to the overlap group. On the second visit, subjects underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Subsequently, they were divided into four groups according to the severity of COPD and coexistence of OSA: COPDI/II; overlap I/II; COPDIII/IV; and overlap III/IV. RESULTS: Of the 268 subjects screened, 31 were included. The overlap group exhibited higher values for peak carbon dioxide (COPD: 830 [678-1157]; overlap: 1127 [938-1305] mm Hg; p < 0.05), minute ventilation (COPD: 31 [27-45]; overlap: 48 [37-55] L; p < 0.05), and peak systolic blood pressure (COPD: 180 [169-191]; overlap: 220 [203-227] mm Hg; p <; 0.001) and peak diastolic blood pressure COPD: 100 [93-103]; overlap: 110 [96-106] mm Hg; p < 0.001). COPD severity associated with OSA produced a negative impact on exercise time (COPDIII/IV: 487 +/- 102; overlap III/IV: 421 +/- 94 s), peak oxygen uptake (COPDIII/IV: 12 +/- 2; overlap III/IV: 9 +/- 1 ml.Kg.min(-1) ; p < 0.05) and circulatory power (COPDIII/IV: 2306 +/- 439; overlap III/IV: 2162 +/-  340 ml/kg/min.mmHg; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Overlap syndrome causes greater hemodynamic and ventilatory demand at the peak of dynamic exercise. In addition, OSA overlap in individuals with more severe COPD impairs CRF.", "PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a widespread comorbidity of obesity. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been demonstrated very effective in treating patients with OSA. The aims of this study were to investigate whether or not cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can characterize patients with OSA and to evaluate the effect of nasal CPAP therapy. METHODS: An observational study was conducted on patients with moderate to severe obesity and suspected OSA. All patients underwent cardiorespiratory sleep study, spirometry, and functional evaluation with ECG-monitored, incremental, maximal CPET. RESULTS: Of the 147 patients, 94 presented with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >/= 15 events/h and were thus considered to have OSA (52 receiving nasal CPAP treatment; 42 untreated) while 53 formed a control group (AHI < 15 events/h). Patients with untreated OSA showed significantly lower oxygen uptake (VO(2)), heart rate, minute ventilation (VE), and end tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO(2)) at peak exercise compared to controls. Patients receiving nasal CPAP showed higher VE and VO(2) at peak exercise compared to untreated patients. A difference in PETCO(2) between the maximum value reached during test and peak exercise (DeltaPETCO(2) max-peak) of 1.71 mmHg was identified as a predictor of OSA. CONCLUSION: Patients with moderate to severe obesity and untreated OSA presented a distinctive CPET-pattern characterized by lower aerobic and exercise capacity, higher PETCO(2) at peak exercise associated with a lower ventilatory response. Nasal CPAP treatment was shown to positively affect these cardiorespiratory adaptations during exercise. DeltaPETCO(2) max-peak may be used to suggest OSA in patients with obesity.", "BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder that affects approximately 1 billion people worldwide. Advanced age is a significant risk factor. Various treatment options have been explored to reduce the severity of OSA symptoms and physical exercise has emerged as a potential alternative therapy. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of a combined exercise program with sleep education on sleep quality and on the severity of OSA in older adults. METHODS: This is a randomized clinical trial with two parallel groups that will involve individuals of both genders aged between 60 and 79 years who have an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of more than 15 events per hour and who have not received or are currently undergoing treatment for OSA. Older adults who have engaged in regular exercise in the last six months and individuals with contraindications to exercise will be excluded. The study will assess outcomes related to OSA, including AHI, oxygen desaturation index, minimum and mean oxyhemoglobin saturation, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and the type of respiratory events. Additionally, sleep quality-related outcomes, daytime sleepiness, physical activity, physical fitness, aerobic capacity, cognitive status, anthropometric measures, and health-related quality of life will be analyzed. Participants will be randomized to two groups: a combined exercise group (involving both resistance and aerobic training) with sleep education, and a control group that will receive only educational recommendations for managing OSA. The intervention will last 12 weeks and will consist of three sessions per week, totaling 36 exercise sessions. Sample size calculation indicates a minimum number of 36 participants. DISCUSSION: If the hypothesis is confirmed, this clinical trial will indicate an effective non-pharmacological intervention for treating OSA in older adults. This intervention could be used as an adjunct to existing approaches designed to improve OSA management. CLINICAL TRAIL REGISTRATION: Brazil Clinical Trials Registry (ReBEC), identifier RBR-9hk6pgz.", "This review presents and addresses the conflicting results on cardiorespiratory fitness among adults with fibromyalgia. The heterogeneity in study designs, symptom severity and the assessment protocols might partly explain these conflicting results. It also presents the possible relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise prescription, attrition from exercise/rehabilitation programmes and independence with activities of daily living. Cardiorespiratory fitness might impact aerobic exercise and independence in daily activities of patients with fibromyalgia, which is often concomitantly diagnosed in patients with sleep disordered breathing, including patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. Therefore, cardiorespiratory fitness evaluation should be considered by general and respiratory physicians as well as physiotherapists who treat patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia for more accurate diagnosis, exercise prescription and monitoring of patients' status. KEY POINTS: Adults with fibromyalgia often present with reduced cardiorespiratory fitness.Reduced cardiorespiratory fitness might have an important impact on functional capacity and quality of life.Adults with fibromyalgia who have a secondary condition affecting their ventilatory anaerobic threshold and/or V'(O(2))(peak), for example chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, might present with a greater reduction of their cardiorespiratory fitness which may not be entirely related to their lung disease. EDUCATIONAL AIMS: To better understand the cardiorespiratory fitness results among adults with fibromyalgia in general, and when taking into account differences in assessment protocol (maximal versus submaximal testing protocol; cycle ergometer versus treadmill testing protocol) and symptom severity (fibromyalgia severity level).To better understand how cardiorespiratory fitness among adults with fibromyalgia could: 1) assist in exercise prescription; 2) minimise dropout rates from exercise/rehabilitation programmes; and 3) promote independence with activities of daily living.To learn why fibromyalgia might be important to consider in adults who have concurrent fibromyalgia and lung disease."]}
{"question": "Characterization of the gender dimorphism after injury and hemorrhagic shock: are hormonal differences responsible?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To characterize the gender dimorphism after injury with specific reference to the reproductive age of the women (young, <48 yrs of age, vs. old, >52 yrs of age) in a cohort of severely injured trauma patients for which significant variation in postinjury care is minimized. DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of an ongoing prospective multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Academic, level I trauma and intensive care unit centers. PATIENTS: Blunt-injured adults with hemorrhagic shock. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Separate Cox proportional hazard regression models were formulated based on all patients to evaluate the effects of gender on mortality, multiple organ failure, and nosocomial infection, after controlling for all important confounders. These models were then used to characterize the effect of gender in young and old age groups. Overall mortality, multiple organ failure, and nosocomial infection rates for the entire cohort (n = 1,036) were 20%, 40%, and 45%, respectively. Mean Injury Severity Score was 32 +/- 14 (mean +/- SD). Men (n = 680) and women (n = 356) were clinically similar except that men required higher crystalloid volumes, more often had a history of alcoholism and liver disease, and had greater ventilatory and intensive care unit requirements. Female gender was independently associated with a 43% and 23% lower risk of multiple organ failure and nosocomial infection, respectively. Gender remained an independent risk factor in young and old subgroup analysis, with the protection afforded by female gender remaining unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The independent protective effect of female gender on multiple organ failure and nosocomial infection rates remains significant in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women when compared with similarly aged men. This is contrary to previous experimental studies and the known physiologic sex hormone changes that occur after menopause in women. These results suggest that factors other than sex hormones may be responsible for gender-based differences after injury."]}
{"question": "Can communication with terminally ill patients be taught?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Communication with terminally ill patients is a main responsibility of physicians. However, many physicians feel insufficiently prepared for this task. Models of courses resulting in improvements of communicative skills of participants have been published mainly in the Anglo-American literature. This study describes the realization of a 2-day course model based on the experiences of the first three courses of this kind in Rhineland-Palatinate, and analyzes changes of participants' communication behavior. METHODS: After each seminary, an evaluation form concerning participants' satisfaction with the course was filled in. Furthermore, all course participants received a questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the course, as well as 3 months afterwards. The participants were asked to assess their own sense of security in seven different communication settings on a visual analog scale, and to specify perceived changes in their communication behavior 3 months after the course. RESULTS: The first three courses were attended by 31 participants. Course evaluation revealed high satisfaction scores with methods as well as with clarity and relevance of the contents. Self-assessment of participants showed a growing sense of security in different communication settings. Important increases could be demonstrated for communicating a diagnosis of cancer with good or less good prognosis, recurrence of cancer or a far progressive cancer disease without curative approach. 3 months after the course, participants described multiple changes indicating increased sensibility and professionalism in communication behavior. CONCLUSION: The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "BACKGROUND: Communicating with patients about goals of care is an important skill for internal medicine residents. However, many trainees are not competent to perform a code status discussion (CSD). A multimodality intervention improved skills in a group of first-year residents in 2011. How long these acquired CSD skills are retained is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To study CSD skill retention one year after a multimodality intervention. DESIGN: This was a longitudinal cohort study. SETTING/SUBJECTS: Thirty-eight second-year internal medicine residents in a university-affiliated internal medicine residency program participated in the study. Nineteen completed the intervention and 19 served as controls. MEASUREMENTS: Mean CSD clinical skills examination (CSE) scores using an 18-item checklist were compared after the intervention (2011) and one year later (2012). RESULTS: Intervention group residents performed significantly better than residents in the control group (71.9% (standard deviation [SD]=16.0%) versus 54.7% (SD=17.1%; p<0.001) at one-year follow-up. Intervention group residents retained their CSD skills at one year as performance was 75.1% in 2011 and 71.9% in 2012 (p=0.46). Control group residents did not develop additional CSD skills as 2011 checklist performance was 53.2% and 2012 performance was 54.7% (p=0.78). CONCLUSIONS: CSD skills taught in a rigorous curriculum are retained at one-year follow-up. Residents in the control group did not acquire new CSD skills despite an additional year of training and clinical experience. Further study is needed to link improved CSD skills to better patient care quality.", "OBJECTIVE: To identify the opportunities for and barriers to medical education about end-of-life (EOL) care in the pediatric setting. METHODS: A working group of pediatric specialists and ethicists was convened at the National Consensus Conference on Medical Education for Care Near the End-of-Life sponsored by the Open Society Institute's Project Death in America and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The charge to the working group was to consider the unique aspects of death in childhood, identify critical educational issues and effective instructional strategies, and recommend institutional changes needed to facilitate teaching about EOL care for children. CONCLUSIONS: Although providing EOL care can be challenging, the cognitive and psychologic skills needed can be taught effectively through well-planned and focused learning experiences. The ultimate goals of such instruction are to provide more humane care to very sick children, enhance bereavement outcomes for their survivors, and develop more confident clinicians. Six specific principles regarding EOL care in the pediatric setting emerged as essential curricular elements that should be taught to all medical care providers to ensure competent patient-centered care. 1) Cognitively and developmentally appropriate communication is most effective. 2) Sharing information with patients helps avoid feelings of isolation and abandonment. 3) The needs of the patient are served when the ethical principles of self-determination and best interests are central to the decision-making process. 4) Minimization of physical and emotional pain and other symptoms requires prompt recognition, careful assessment, and comprehensive treatment. 5) Developing partnerships with families supports them in their caregiving efforts. 6) The personal and professional challenges faced by providers of EOL care deserve to be addressed. These principles actually transcend patient age and can be used to inform medical education about the care of any terminally ill patient. Similarly, these principles of effective communication, ethical decision-making, and attention to the quality of life of patients, families, and providers apply to the care of all children regardless of diagnosis and prognosis. With this in mind, teaching about EOL care does not require a new and separate curriculum, but rather taking better advantage of the many teachable moments provided by caring for a dying patient.", "For patients at the end of life, it is crucial to address the psychological, existential, and spiritual distress of patients. Medical education research suggests trainees feel unprepared to provide the whole person, humanistic care held as the ideal. This study used an empirically based narrative intervention, the dignity interview, as an educational intervention with first year residents. The interview helps patients tell and make meaning of their life story. The intervention was aimed at addressing trainee perceived gaps in the non-physical aspects of end-of-life care. It was also intended to stimulate broader reflection on lessons learned in medical education about the value of narrative as part of humanistic care. Twelve first year residents administered a 1 h interview to dying patients. The resident returned to read the transcribed story back to the patient. Semi-structured interviews of the residents were transcribed and analyzed using the constant comparative method to identify emergent themes. This experience was seen as distinct from the 'traditional\" medical interview. Residents reflected on lessons learned from patients and on their own professional and personal lives. Residents felt conversations with dying patients, and more broadly the art of soliciting a patient's story are poorly taught and modeled. More concerning, the hidden curriculum seems to be sending messages that learning a patient's story is not the domain of a physician and that it is not valued like the curing and technical imperatives. These findings have implications for medical education's ongoing attempts to better produce humanistic physicians.", "CONTEXT: Palliative care (PC) education for medical students is important. Knowledge concerning drugs and services can be readily taught, and skills of communicating with terminally ill patients and their families are increasingly being addressed. Developing positive attitudes toward caring for patients near the end of life is more challenging. OBJECTIVES: To examine medical students' attitudes toward PC in each year of their course, investigate changes in these attitudes over time during their course, and identify gender differences in attitudes and attitudinal change. METHODS: Questionnaires administered to four cohorts of preclinical core science and clinical medical students at the University of Cambridge Medical School from 2007 to 2010, with annual longitudinal follow-up in subsequent years; 1027 participants in total. RESULTS: Students started their medical course with broadly positive attitudes toward PC, which largely persisted into the final years. During the core science component, some attitudes became more negative, whereas during the clinical component, some attitudes became more positive. Over the whole course, there was evidence of increasingly positive attitudes. No significant effect of gender on attitudes or attitudinal change was found. Although statistically significant, all these changes were small. CONCLUSION: Medical students' attitudes toward their future role in caring for people with PC needs were broadly positive. Core science was associated with increasingly negative attitudes and clinical studies with increasingly positive attitudes. For teaching faculty, the challenge remains to address negative and foster positive attitudes toward PC during medical school."]}
{"question": "Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To provide insight into the factors by which obesity in itself may directly lead to early arterial damage, we aimed to determine early sonographic markers of obesity-related vascular dysfunction in young obese males. METHODS: Thirty-five young obese males and 23 age-matched healthy male volunteers were recruited into the study. Common carotid artery pulsatility index and resistance index were calculated from blood flow velocities curves obtained by pulsed Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: The mean pulsatility index, resistance index, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, plasma fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were statistically higher in obese subjects than in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that depressed vessel compliance and increased vascular resistance are features of young, obese, normotensive subjects independently of and in addition to cardiovascular risk factors. As changes in arterial wall properties may be incipient in young obese subjects, future studies will be required to demonstrate whether early intervention such as diet and exercise in this population can improve vascular functions."]}
{"question": "Are acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit programme for older people socially imbalanced?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Preventive home visits are offered to community dwelling older people in Denmark aimed at maintaining their functional ability for as long as possible, but only two thirds of older people accept the offer from the municipalities. The purpose of this study is to investigate 1) whether socioeconomic status was associated with acceptance of preventive home visits among older people and 2) whether municipality invitational procedures for the preventive home visits modified the association. METHODS: The study population included 1,023 community dwelling 80-year-old individuals from the Danish intervention study on preventive home visits. Information on preventive home visit acceptance rates was obtained from questionnaires. Socioeconomic status was measured by financial assets obtained from national registry data, and invitational procedures were identified through the municipalities. Logistic regression analyses were used, adjusted by gender. RESULTS: Older persons with high financial assets accepted preventive home visits more frequently than persons with low assets (adjusted OR = 1.5 (CI95%: 1.1-2.0)). However, the association was attenuated when adjusted by the invitational procedures. The odds ratio for accepting preventive home visits was larger among persons with low financial assets invited by a letter with a proposed date than among persons with high financial assets invited by other procedures, though these estimates had wide confidence intervals. CONCLUSION: High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures."]}
{"question": "Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles?", "retrieved_passages": ["Open access (OA) to the research literature has the potential to accelerate recognition and dissemination of research findings, but its actual effects are controversial. This was a longitudinal bibliometric analysis of a cohort of OA and non-OA articles published between June 8, 2004, and December 20, 2004, in the same journal (PNAS: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). Article characteristics were extracted, and citation data were compared between the two groups at three different points in time: at \"quasi-baseline\" (December 2004, 0-6 mo after publication), in April 2005 (4-10 mo after publication), and in October 2005 (10-16 mo after publication). Potentially confounding variables, including number of authors, authors' lifetime publication count and impact, submission track, country of corresponding author, funding organization, and discipline, were adjusted for in logistic and linear multiple regression models. A total of 1,492 original research articles were analyzed: 212 (14.2% of all articles) were OA articles paid by the author, and 1,280 (85.8%) were non-OA articles. In April 2005 (mean 206 d after publication), 627 (49.0%) of the non-OA articles versus 78 (36.8%) of the OA articles were not cited (relative risk = 1.3 [95% Confidence Interval: 1.1-1.6]; p = 0.001). 6 mo later (mean 288 d after publication), non-OA articles were still more likely to be uncited (non-OA: 172 [13.6%], OA: 11 [5.2%]; relative risk = 2.6 [1.4-4.7]; p < 0.001). The average number of citations of OA articles was higher compared to non-OA articles (April 2005: 1.5 [SD = 2.5] versus 1.2 [SD = 2.0]; Z = 3.123; p = 0.002; October 2005: 6.4 [SD = 10.4] versus 4.5 [SD = 4.9]; Z = 4.058; p < 0.001). In a logistic regression model, controlling for potential confounders, OA articles compared to non-OA articles remained twice as likely to be cited (odds ratio = 2.1 [1.5-2.9]) in the first 4-10 mo after publication (April 2005), with the odds ratio increasing to 2.9 (1.5-5.5) 10-16 mo after publication (October 2005). Articles published as an immediate OA article on the journal site have higher impact than self-archived or otherwise openly accessible OA articles. We found strong evidence that, even in a journal that is widely available in research libraries, OA articles are more immediately recognized and cited by peers than non-OA articles published in the same journal. OA is likely to benefit science by accelerating dissemination and uptake of research findings.", "Barriers to accessing scientific findings contribute to knowledge inequalities based on financial resources and decrease the transparency and rigor of scientific research. Recent initiatives aim to improve access to research as well as methodological rigor via transparency and openness. We sought to determine the impact of such initiatives on open access publishing in the sub-area of human electrophysiology and the impact of open access on the attention articles received in the scholarly literature and other outlets. Data for 35,144 articles across 967 journals from the last 20 years were examined. Approximately 35% of articles were open access, and the rate of publication of open-access articles increased over time. Open access articles showed 9 to 21% more PubMed and CrossRef citations and 39% more Altmetric mentions than closed access articles. Green open access articles (i.e., author archived) did not differ from non-green open access articles (i.e., publisher archived) with respect to citations and were related to higher Altmetric mentions. These findings demonstrate that open-access publishing is increasing in popularity in the sub-area of human electrophysiology and that open-access articles enjoy the \"open access advantage\" in citations similar to the larger scientific literature. The benefit of the open access advantage may motivate researchers to make their publications open access and pursue publication outlets that support it. In consideration of the direct connection between citations and journal impact factor, journal editors may improve the accessibility and impact of published articles by encouraging authors to self-archive manuscripts on preprint servers.", "PURPOSE: This study examined the effect of open access (OA) status on scholarly and societal metrics of impact (citation counts and altmetric scores, respectively) across manuscripts published in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Journals. METHOD: Three thousand four hundred nineteen manuscripts published in four active ASHA Journals were grouped across three access statuses based on their availability to the public: Gold OA, Green OA, and Closed Access. Two linear mixed-effects models tested the effects of OA status on citation counts and altmetric scores of the manuscripts. RESULTS: Both Green OA and Gold OA significantly predicted a 2.70 and 5.21 respective increase in citation counts compared with Closed Access manuscripts (p < .001). Gold OA was estimated to predict a 25.7-point significant increase in altmetric scores (p < .001), but Green OA was only marginally significant (p = .68) in predicting a 1.44 increase in altmetric scores relative to Closed Access manuscripts. DISCUSSION: Communication sciences and disorders (CSD) research that is fully open receives more online attention and, overall, more scientific attention than research that is paywalled or available through Green OA methods. Additional research is needed to understand secondary variables affecting these and other scholarly and societal metrics of impact across studies in CSD. Ongoing support and incentives to reduce the inequities of OA publishing are critical for continued scientific advancement.

For non-open access (non-OA) journals, this influence may be due to the fact that high-IF journals are more often purchased by libraries, and are therefore more often available to researchers, than low-IF journals. This positive influence has not, however, been shown specifically for papers published in open access (OA) journals, which are universally accessible, and do not need library purchase. It is therefore important to ascertain if the IF influences citations in OA journals too. Methods 203 randomized controlled trials (102 OA and 101 non-OA) published in January 2011 were included in the study. Five-year citations for papers published in OA journals were compared to those for non-OA journals. Source papers were derived from PubMed. Citations were retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The Thompson-Reuter's IF was used. Results OA journals were found to have significantly more citations overall compared to non-OA journals (median 15.5 vs 12, p=0.039). The IF did not correlate with citations for OA journals (Spearman's rho =0.187, p=0.60). The increase in the citations with increasing IF was minimal for OA journals (beta coefficient = 3.346, 95% CI -0.464, 7.156, p=0.084). In contrast, the IF did show moderate correlation with citations for articles published in non-OA journals (Spearman's rho=0.514, p<0.001). The increase in the number of citations was also significant (beta coefficient = 4.347, 95% CI 2.42, 6.274, p<0.001). Conclusion It is better to publish in an OA journal for more citations. It may not be worth paying high publishing fees for higher IF journals, because there is minimal gain in terms of increased number of citations. On the other hand, if one wishes to publish in a non-OA journal, it is better to choose one with a high IF.", "Neuropsychopharmacology (NPP) offers the option to publish articles in different tiers of an open access (OA) publishing system: Green, Bronze, or Hybrid. Green articles follow a standard access (SA) subscription model, in which readers must pay a subscription fee to access article content on the publisher's website. Bronze articles are selected at the publisher's discretion and offer free availability to readers at the same article processing charge (APC) as Green articles. Hybrid articles are fully OA, but authors pay an increased APC to ensure public access. Here, we aimed to determine whether publishing tier affect the impact and reach of scientific articles in NPP. A sample of 6000 articles published between 2001-2021 were chosen for the analysis. Articles were separated by article type and publication year. Citation counts and Altmetric scores were compared between the three tiers. Bronze articles received significantly more citations than Green and Hybrid articles overall. However, when analyzed by year, Bronze and Hybrid articles received comparable citation counts within the past decade. Altmetric scores were comparable between all tiers, although this effect varied by year.

{"question": "Does the early adopter of drugs exist?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To analyse associations between indicators for adoption of new drugs and to test the hypothesis that physicians' early adoption of new drugs is a personal trait independent of drug groups. METHODS: In a population-based cohort study using register data, we analysed the prescribing of new drugs by Danish general practitioners. Angiotensin-II antagonists, triptans, selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 antagonists and esomeprazol were used in the assessment. As indicators of new drug uptake, we used adoption time, cumulative incidence, preference proportion, incidence rate and prescription cost and volume. For each measure, we ranked the general practices. Ranks were pair-wise plotted, and Pearson's correlation coefficient ( r) was calculated. Next, we analysed the correlation between ranks across different drug classes. RESULTS: For all indicators, the general practitioners' adoption of one group of drugs was poorly associated with adoption of others ( r</=0.49), indicating that early adoption of one type of drugs is not associated with early adoption of another. For all drug groups, adoption time adjusted for practice size was only weakly associated with other indicators ( r: -0.56 to -0.27). Indicators, based on cost and volume of drugs, were highly correlated ( r: 0.96-0.99), and the others correlated reasonably well ( r: 0.51-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Within drug groups, indicators of drug adoption, except for adoption time, correlate reasonably well. However, the theory that physicians' early adoption of new drugs is a personal trait independent of the type of drug could not be confirmed. The notion of the early-drug-adopting general practitioner may be mistaken.", "Computational modeling has been adopted in all aspects of drug research and development, from the early phases of target identification and drug discovery to the late-stage clinical trials. The different questions addressed during each stage of drug R&D has led to the emergence of different modeling methodologies. In the research phase, systems biology couples experimental data with elaborate computational modeling techniques to capture lifecycle and effector cellular functions (e.g. metabolism, signaling, transcription regulation, protein synthesis and interaction) and integrates them in quantitative models. These models are subsequently used in various ways, i.e. to identify new targets, generate testable hypotheses, gain insights on the drug's mode of action (MOA), translate preclinical findings, and assess the potential of clinical drug efficacy and toxicity. In the development phase, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling is the established way to determine safe and efficacious doses for testing at increasingly larger, and more pertinent to the target indication, cohorts of subjects. First, the relationship between drug input and its concentration in plasma is established. Second, the relationship between this concentration and desired or undesired PD responses is ascertained. Recognizing that the interface of systems biology with PK/PD will facilitate drug development, systems pharmacology came into existence, combining methods from PK/PD modeling and systems engineering explicitly to account for the implicated mechanisms of the target system in the study of drug-target interactions. Herein, a number of popular system biology methodologies are discussed, which could be leveraged within a systems pharmacology framework to address major issues in drug development.", "The past decade witnessed rapid development of novel drugs and therapeutic biological agents. The marketing authorization for novel therapies is often time consuming and distressing for patients. Earlier clinical trials were the only way to access new drugs under development. However, not every patient meets the enrolment criteria, and participation is difficult for patients with life-threatening, long-lasting or seriously debilitating diseases like rare diseases. Early access programs like \"Compassionate Use Program (CUP)\" have generated alternative channels for such patients. The European Medical Agency provides regulations and recommendations for compassionate use, upon which every European Union (EU) member state has developed its own rules and regulations. Despite previous reviews and studies, the available information is limited and gaps exist. This literature review explores CUP in 28 EU member states. Data was collected through literature review and use of country-specific search terms from the healthcare domain. Data sources were not limited to databases and articles published in journals, but also included grey literature. The results implied that CUP was present in 20 EU member states (71%). Of 28 EU states, 18 ( approximately 64%) had nationalized regulations and processes were well-defined. Overall, this review identified CUP and its current status and legislation in 28 EU member states. The established legislation for CUP in the EU member states suggest their willingness to adopt processes that facilitate earlier and better access to new medicines. Further research and periodic reviews are warranted to understand the contemporary and future regulatory trends in early access programs.", "Precision medicine in oncology involves identifying the 'right drug', at the 'right dose', for the right person. Currently, many orally administered anti-cancer drugs, particularly kinase inhibitors (KIs), are prescribed at a standard fixed dose. Identifying the right dose remains one of the biggest challenges to optimal patient care. Recently the Precision Dosing Group established the Accurate Dosing of Anti-cancer Patient-centred Therapies (ADAPT) Program to address individualised dosing; thus, use existing anti-cancer drugs more safely and efficiently. In this paper, we outline our framework, based on the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework, with a simple 6-step process and strategies which have led to the successful implementation of the ADAPT program in South Australia. Implementation strategies in our 6-step process involve: (1) Evaluate the evidence and identify the cancer drugs: Literature review, shadowing other experts, establishing academic partnerships, adaptability/flexibility; (2) Establishment of analytical equipment for drug assays for clinical purposes: assessment for readiness, accreditation, feasibility, obtaining formal commitments, quality assurance to all stakeholders; (3) Clinical preparation and education: educational material, conducted educational meetings, involve opinion leaders, use of mass media, promote network weaving, conduct ongoing training; (4) Blood collection, sample preparation and analyses: goods received procedures, critical control points (transport time); (5) Interpret and release results with recommendations: facilitate the relay of clinical data to providers; (6) Clinical application: providing ongoing consultation, identify early adopters, identify, and prepare champions. These strategies were selected from the 73 implementation strategies outlined in the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) study. The ADAPT program currently provides routine plasma concentrations for patients on several orally administered drugs in South Australia and is currently in its evaluation phase soon to be published. Our newly established framework could provide great potential and opportunities to advance individualised dosing of oral anti-cancer drugs in routine clinical care.", "The human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (hADME) study is the cornerstone of the clinical pharmacology package for small molecule drugs, providing comprehensive information on the rates and routes of disposition and elimination of drug-related material in humans through the use of (14) C-labeled drug. Significant changes have already been made in the design of the hADME study for many companies, but opportunity exists to continue to re-think both the design and timing of the hADME study in light of the potential offered by newer technologies, that enable flexibility in particular to reducing the magnitude of the radioactive dose used. This paper provides considerations on the variety of current strategies that exist across a number of pharmaceutical companies and on some of the ongoing debates around a potential move to the so called \"human first/human only\" approach, already adopted by at least one company. The paper also provides a framework for continuing the discussion in the application of further shifts in the paradigm."]}
{"question": "Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: There are three main service delivery channels: clinical services, outreach, and family and community. To determine which delivery channels are associated with the greatest reductions in under-5 mortality rates (U5MR), we used data from sequential population-based surveys to examine the correlation between changes in coverage of clinical, outreach, and family and community services and in U5MR for 27 high-burden countries. METHODS: Household survey data were abstracted from serial surveys in 27 countries. Average annual changes (AAC) between the most recent and penultimate survey were calculated for under-five mortality rates and for 22 variables in the domains of clinical, outreach, and family- and community-based services. For all 27 countries and a subset of 19 African countries, we conducted principal component analysis to reduce the variables into a few components in each domain and applied linear regression to assess the correlation between changes in the principal components and changes in under-five mortality rates after controlling for multiple potential confounding factors. RESULTS: AAC in under 5-mortality varied from 6.6% in Nepal to -0.9% in Kenya, with six of the 19 African countries all experiencing less than a 1% decline in mortality. The strongest correlation with reductions in U5MR was observed for access to clinical services (all countries: p = 0.02, r(2) = 0.58; 19 African countries p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.67). For outreach activities, AAC U5MR was significantly correlated with antenatal care and family planning services, while AAC in immunization services showed no association. In the family- and community services domain, improvements in breastfeeding were associated with significant changes in mortality in the 30 countries but not in the African subset; while in the African countries, nutritional status improvements were associated with a significant decline in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the importance of increasing access to clinical services, certain outreach services and breastfeeding and, in Africa, of improving nutritional status. Integrated programs that emphasize these services may lead to substantial mortality declines."]}
{"question": "Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is the functional renal failure associated with advanced cirrhosis and has also been described in fulminant hepatic failure. Without liver transplantation its prognosis is dismal. Our study included patients with type 1 HRS associated with cirrhosis, who were not liver transplant candidates. AIM: To identify variables associated with improved survival. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients fulfilled the revised Ascites Club Criteria for type 1 HRS. None of them was suitable for liver transplantation. All the patients were treated with combinations of: albumin, midodrine and octreotide, pressors, and hemodialysis. RESULTS: Median survival was 13 days for the whole group. Survival varied with the end-stage liver disease (ESLD) etiology: autoimmune, 49 days, cardiac cirrhosis, 22 days, idiopathic, 15.5 days, viral, 15 days, hepatitis C and alcohol, 14.5 days, alcohol 8 days, and neoplasia 4 days (p = 0.048). Survival of HRS associated with alcoholic liver disease versus other etiologies was not statistically significant (p = 0.1). Increased serum creatinine (p = 0.02) and urinary sodium 6-10 mEq/l (p = 0.027) at the initiation of therapy were prognostic factors for mortality. HRS treatment modalities (p = 0.73), use of dialysis (p = 0.56), dialysis modality (p = 0.35), use of vasopressors (p = 0.26), pre-existing renal disease (p = 0.49), gender (p = 0.90), and age (p = 0.57) were not associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time ESLD etiology as a prognostic factor for survival. The renal function (expressed as serum creatinine) and urinary Na (<5 mEq/l) at the time of diagnosis were found to be associated with survival, suggesting that early treatment might increase survival.", "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatorenal syndrome is a major complication in patients with cirrhosis and associated with high mortality. Predictive biomarkers for therapy response are largely missing. Cytokeratin18-based cell death markers are significantly elevated in patients with complications of chronic liver disease, but the role of these markers in patients with HRS treated with vasoconstrictors and albumin is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed a total of 138 patients with HRS, liver cirrhosis without HRS and acute kidney injury treated at the University Medical Center Mainz between April 2013 and July 2018. Serum levels of M30 and M65 were analyzed by ELISA and clinical data were collected. Predictive ability was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves, logistic regression and c-statistic. Primary endpoint was response to therapy. RESULTS: M30 and M65 were significantly increased in patients with HRS compared to non-HRS controls (M30: p < 0.0001; M65: p < 0.0001). Both serum markers showed predictive ability for dialysis- and LTX-free survival but not overall survival. Logistic regression confirmed M30 and M65 as independent prognostic factors for response to therapy. A novel predictive score comprising bilirubin and M65 showed highest predictive ability to predict therapy response. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of M30 and M65 can robustly discriminate patients into responders and non-responders to terlipressin therapy with a good predictive ability for dialysis- and LTX-free survival in cirrhotic patients. Cell death parameters might possess clinical relevance in patients with liver cirrhosis and HRS.", "Patients with cirrhosis of the liver are at high risk of a large variety of complications. Especially the development of portal hypertension, followed by gastroesophageal varicosis and ascites are potentially life threatening problems. In the treatment of gastroesophageal varicosis primary prophylaxis to prevent a first bleeding episode, acute therapy for bleeding varices, and secondary prophylaxis to prevent patients from rebleeding have to be considered. While treating patients with ascites the high frequency of side effects induced by diuretics has to be taken into account. In addition, the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis must not be missed. Hepatorenal syndrome, a typical complication of advanced cirrhosis is especially difficult to treat and is considered an indication for liver transplantation.", "IMPORTANCE: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is currently the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. It is important to develop noninvasive tests to assess the disease severity and prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To study the prognostic implications of baseline levels and dynamic changes of the vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE)-based scores developed for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis (Agile 3+) and cirrhosis (Agile 4) in patients with MASLD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included data from a natural history cohort of patients with MASLD who underwent VCTE examination at 16 tertiary referral centers in the US, Europe, and Asia from February 2004 to January 2023, of which the data were collected prospectively at 14 centers. Eligible patients were adults aged at least 18 years with hepatic steatosis diagnosed by histologic methods (steatosis in >/=5% of hepatocytes) or imaging studies (ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, or controlled attenuation parameter >/=248 dB/m by VCTE). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was liver-related events (LREs), defined as hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatic decompensation (ascites, variceal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, or hepatorenal syndrome), liver transplant, and liver-related deaths. The Agile scores were compared with histologic and 8 other noninvasive tests. RESULTS: A total of 16\u202f603 patients underwent VCTE examination at baseline (mean [SD] age, 52.5 [13.7] years; 9600 [57.8%] were male). At a median follow-up of 51.7 (IQR, 25.2-85.2) months, 316 patients (1.9%) developed LREs. Both Agile 3+ and Agile 4 scores classified fewer patients between the low and high cutoffs than most fibrosis scores and achieved the highest discriminatory power in predicting LREs (integrated area under the time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.89). A total of 10\u202f920 patients (65.8%) had repeated VCTE examination at a median interval of 15 (IQR, 11.3-27.7) months and were included in the serial analysis. A total of 81.9% of patients (7208 of 8810) had stable Agile 3+ scores and 92.6% of patients (8163 of 8810) had stable Agile 4 scores (same risk categories at both assessments). The incidence of LREs was 0.6 per 1000 person-years in patients with persistently low Agile 3+ scores and 30.1 per 1000 person-years in patients with persistently high Agile 3+ scores. In patients with high Agile 3+ score at baseline, a decrease in the score by more than 20% was associated with substantial reduction in the risk of LREs. A similar trend was observed for the Agile 4 score, although it missed more LREs in the low-risk group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings of this study suggest that single or serial Agile scores are highly accurate in predicting LREs in patients with MASLD, making them suitable alternatives to liver biopsy in routine clinical practice and in phase 2b and 3 clinical trials for steatohepatitis.", "For 30 years the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is successfully used for the treatment of portal hypertension. Indication for TIPS in relation to variceal bleeding and refractory ascites is scientifically documented and defined by national and international guidelines. For rare indications such as hepatorenal syndrome, portal vein thrombosis or the neodjuvant TIPS larger evidence-based studies are missing. An important contraindication and the leading clinical complication after TIPS is the development of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Reduction of post-TIPS HE is therefore aimed through development of further technical enhancements of the TIPS-stents."]}
{"question": "Vaginal dose assessment in image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer: Can we really rely on dose-point evaluation?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Although dose-volume parameters in image-guided brachytherapy have become a standard, the use of posterior-inferior border of the pubic symphysis (PIBS) points has been recently proposed in the reporting of vaginal doses. The aim was to evaluate their pertinence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nineteen patients who received image-guided brachytherapy after concurrent radiochemotherapy were included. Per treatment, CT scans were performed at Days 2 and 3, with reporting of the initial dwell positions and times. Doses delivered to the PIBS points were evaluated on each plan, considering that they were representative of one-third of the treatment. The movements of the applicator according to the PIBS point were analysed. RESULTS: Mean prescribed doses at PIBS -2, PIBS, PIBS +2 were, respectively, 2.23 +/- 1.4, 6.39 +/- 6.6, and 31.85 +/- 36.06 Gy. Significant differences were observed between the 5 patients with vaginal involvement and the remaining 14 at the level of PIBS +2 and PIBS: +47.60 Gy and +7.46 Gy, respectively (p = 0.023 and 0.03). The variations between delivered and prescribed doses at PIBS points were not significant. However, at International commission on radiation units and measurements rectovaginal point, the delivered dose was decreased by 1.43 +/- 2.49 Gy from the planned dose (p = 0.019). The delivered doses at the four points were strongly correlated with the prescribed doses with R(2) ranging from 0.93 to 0.95. The movements of the applicator in regard of the PIBS point assessed with the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine coordinates were insignificant. CONCLUSION: The doses evaluated at PIBS points are not impacted by intrafractional movements. PIBS and PIBS +2 dose points allow distinguishing the plans of patients with vaginal infiltration. Further studies are needed to correlate these parameters with vaginal morbidity."]}
{"question": "Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children: a good choice?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Stock et al. (Eur Respir J 25:47-53, 2005) recently estimated asthma prevalence in Germany using claims data on prescriptions and hospital diagnoses and found high prevalence peaks in infants. Our objective was to critically assess and discuss various aspects of identifying children with asthma using prescription data. METHODS: We replicated the selection procedure of Stock et al. using data on 290,919 children aged 0-17 years insured in the Gmunder ErsatzKasse (GEK) in 2005. Asthma prevalence was also estimated in a sample of 17,641 children aged 0-17 years participating in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) from 2003 to 2006. RESULTS: In children aged 0-4 years insured in the GEK, prevalences were found to range from 11.7 to 17.7% for boys and from 7.2 to 11.1% for girls when the criteria of Stock et al. were applied. A steady decline in prevalences was observed in older age groups. Asthma prevalence estimated in the KiGGS data showed a quite different distribution. In the age group 0-4 years, prevalences were found to range from 0 to 2.6% in boys and from 0 to 1.0% in girls; in children >4 years, prevalences were found to increase with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: When additional validation studies were taken into account, asthma medications were found to be prescribed not only for asthma but also for other respiratory diseases. In addition, not all children with current asthma had prescriptions. We therefore conclude that asthma medications are therefore not a good proxy for the disease."]}
{"question": "Does the familial transmission of drinking patterns persist into young adulthood?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Parental drinking has been shown to be associated with offspring drinking. However, the relationship appears to be more complex than often assumed and few studies have tracked it over longer time periods. AIMS: To explore the long-term (10-year) transmission of familial drinking during adolescence to offspring drinking patterns in young adulthood. DESIGN: Swedish longitudinal study, assessing the relationship between familial drinking in 2000 and offspring drinking in 2010 using simultaneous quantile regression analysis (n=744). DATA: Data on familial drinking was gathered from the Swedish level-of-living surveys (LNU) and from partner LNU in 2000 while data on offspring drinking in young adulthood was gathered from LNU 2010. Drinking among offspring, parents and potential stepparents was measured through identical quantity-frequency indices referring to the past 12 months in 2010 and 2000 respectively. RESULTS: Young adults whose families were abstainers in 2000 drank substantially less across quintiles in 2010 than offspring of non-abstaining families. The difference, however, was not statistically significant between quintiles of the conditional distribution. Actual drinking levels in drinking families were not at all or weakly associated with drinking in offspring. Supplementary analyses confirmed these patterns. CONCLUSION: The association between familial drinking and offspring drinking in young adulthood exhibits clear non-linear trends. Changes in the lower part of the familial drinking distribution are strongly related to drinking in young adults, but the actual levels of drinking in drinking families appear less important in shaping the drinking patterns of the offspring in young adulthood.", "BACKGROUND: Parent alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a well-established risk factor for the development of offspring AUD and is associated with poor parenting. However, few studies have examined heterogeneity in trajectories of parental AUD and its influence on adolescent offspring drinking, and no studies to date have considered the differential risk to offspring conferred by parental AUDs that are limited to early adulthood. Specifically, AUDs limited to the period of emerging adulthood may confer less risk to a child's environment as recovery following emerging adulthood coincides with the typical ages of entry into the parenting role. The present study tested whether parental AUDs developmentally limited to emerging adulthood (DLAUD) transmit less risk for alcohol problems and alcohol consumption in offspring compared to offspring of parents with AUDs spanning across multiple developmental periods (persistent AUD), as mediated by positive parenting strategies. METHOD: Pathways were examined using longitudinal mediation models (N\u202f=\u202f361) comparing offspring with parental DLAUD, persistent AUD, and no AUD. RESULTS: Parents with DLAUD do not transmit the same risk for alcohol problems to offspring as parents with persistent AUD (B\u202f=\u202f0.173, SE\u202f=\u202f0.067, p\u202f<\u202f.05); more offspring alcohol problems were associated with persistent AUD than with DLAUD. Positive parenting mediated the transmission of risk from parental AUD to offspring alcohol problems (B\u202f=\u202f0.040, SE\u202f=\u202f0.019, p\u202f<\u202f.05) and consumption (B\u202f=\u202f0.019, SE\u202f=\u202f0.011, p\u202f<\u202f.05) only when comparing persistent AUD vs. no parental AUD. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that the developmental period in which parents' recovery occurs is a useful way to categorize \"recovered\" AUDs versus current AUDs.", "BACKGROUND: Much of the research on adult children of alcoholics has focused on the transmission of drinking patterns from parents to their children and the development of alcohol-related problems. Less is known about how exposure to parental problem drinking affects children as they progress into adulthood in terms of other mental health outcomes. This is crucial information, in part because the average age of onset for depression and other mental health disorders is during late adolescence or young adulthood. AIMS: The objective of this study was to rigorously assess the long-term impacts of parental problem drinking on adult children's mental and self-perceived overall health. The study improves on previous literature by analyzing a range of mental health markers and other predictors of morbidity, by focusing on a period of adulthood that only a limited number of studies have examined, and by using data from a highly regarded and nationally representative panel study. DATA: The analysis used data from the NLSY79, a nationally representative sample of 12,686 men and women. The NLSY79 collected detailed information about personal and family characteristics, including alcohol and other substance use, for a cohort of individuals who were between the ages of 14 and 22 when first surveyed in 1979. The survey was re-administered each year through 1994 and on a biennial basis since then. The dataset provides information on parental drinking and identifies problematic drinking behaviors both among mothers and fathers. Beginning with the 1998 survey, an extensive health module was administered to respondents over 40 years of age to provide a baseline health profile of the respondents before retirement. It includes a set of measures that assess the mental, physical, and behavioral health of the respondents when they reached the age of 40. METHODS: Estimation was conducted using propensity score matching (PSM) methods. Through the use of PSM methods, we control for a rich set of observed demographic, household, geographic, and economic characteristics, as well as unobserved features correlated with these variables, that predispose a parent to drink problematically, thereby reducing the possibility of estimation bias. In addition, PSM is superior to traditional multivariate regression in that it allows for the possibility of non-linear effects and the comparison of treatment and control individuals with similar characteristics. RESULTS: The results indicate that parental problem drinking is associated with significant mental health consequences for children that persist far into adulthood. Adult respondents with a problem-drinking father were more likely to have been diagnosed with mental health problems relative to other respondents, while those with a problem-drinking mother had poorer self-perceived health and mental health (SF-12) scores. Respondents with a problem-drinking mother were also more likely to have ever been diagnosed with a mental health problem. Outcomes were worse for daughters of problem drinkers than for sons. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: These long-lasting consequences of parental problem drinking on adult children's mental health should be considered when designing and financing interventions targeting problem drinkers and their families."]}
{"question": "Proof of concept study: does fenofibrate have a role in sleep apnoea syndrome?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of fenofibrate on sleep apnoea indices. METHODS: Proof-of-concept study comprising a placebo run-in period (1 week, 5 weeks if fibrate washout was required) and a 4-week randomized, double-blind treatment period. Thirty-four subjects (mean age 55 years, body mass index 34 kg/m 2 , fasting triglycerides 3.5 mmol/L) with diagnosed sleep apnoea syndrome not treated with continuous positive airways pressure were enrolled and randomized to once daily treatment with fenofibrate (145 mg NanoCrystal(R) tablet) or placebo. Overnight polysomnography, computerized attention/vigilance tests and blood sampling for measurement of lipids, insulin, fasting plasma glucose and fibrinogen were performed at the end of each study period. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00816829. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: As this was an exploratory study, a range of sleep variables were evaluated. The apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) and percentage of time spent with arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) <90% were relevant as they have been evaluated in other clinical trials. Other variables included total apnoeas, hypopnoeas and oxygen desaturations, and non-cortical micro-awakenings related to respiratory events per hour. RESULTS: Fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced the percentage of time with SpO(2) <90% (from 9.0% to 3.5% vs. 10.0% to 11.5% with placebo, p = 0.007), although there was no significant change in the AHI (reduction vs. control 14% (95%CI -47 to 40%, p = 0.533). Treatment reduced obstructive apnoeas (by 44%, from 18.5 at baseline to 15.0 at end of treatment vs. 29.0 to 30.5 on placebo, p = 0.048), and non-cortical micro-awakenings per hour (from 23.5 to 18.0 vs. 24.0 to 25.0 with placebo, p = 0.004). Other sleep variables were not significantly influenced by fenofibrate. KEY LIMITATIONS: Exploratory study in patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea, limited treatment duration; concomitant hypnotic treatment (35%); lack of correction for multiplicity of testing. CONCLUSIONS: The consistent direction of change in sleep indices in this proof-of-concept study may support further investigation of fenofibrate in moderate to severe sleep apnoea syndrome."]}
{"question": "Is specialty care associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Implementation of the complex treatment strategies that have been shown to improve survival of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) may require certain expertise. We wanted to examine the association between pattern of outpatient care and survival of patients with CHF. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study conducted with national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) databases, we examined the association between the pattern of outpatient care and survival in 11,661 patients discharged from VA hospitals between October 1, 1991, and September 30, 1992, with the primary diagnosis of CHF (cohort 1). Patients were divided into 4 groups, on the basis of their pattern of outpatient care over a 12-month period after discharge: 1) general medicine clinic visits only (GM-only); 2) cardiology clinic visits only (CARD-only); 3) general medicine and cardiology (MIXED) clinic visits; and 4) neither general medicine nor cardiology clinic visits (no-GM/CARD). We used the Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate 1-year survival, controlling for clinical and demographic factors. Consistency of our results was examined by performing identical analysis on a cohort of patients discharged from VHA hospitals between October 1, 1994, and September 30, 1995 (cohort 2, n = 10,141). RESULTS: The overall 1-year mortality rate was 23% in the primary cohort. The unadjusted mortality rate was highest for patients in the no-GM/CARD follow up (29%) and lowest for patients in the MIXED group (19%). By use of the MIXED group as reference and adjusting for important clinical and demographic factors, the risk of death (risk ratio [95% CI]) was 1.12 (0.94-1.34) in the CARD-only group, 1.26 (1.15-1.38) in the GM-only group, and 1.48 (1.28-1.72) in the no-GM/CARD group. Cohort-2 results were consistent with cohort 1 for most covariates, and significant survival differences were again found between GM-only and the MIXED group (1.25 [1.14-1.37]). CONCLUSIONS: We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "AIMS: Factors influencing follow-up referral decisions and their prognostic implications are poorly investigated in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced (HFrEF), mildly reduced (HFmrEF), and preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction (EF). We assessed (i) the proportion of, (ii) independent predictors of, and (iii) outcomes associated with follow-up in specialty vs. primary care across the EF spectrum. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed 75 518 patients from the large and nationwide Swedish HF registry between 2000-2018. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify the independent predictors of planned follow-up in specialty vs. primary care, and multivariable Cox models to assess the association between follow-up type and outcomes. In this nationwide registry, 48 115 (64%) patients were planned for follow-up in specialty and 27 403 (36%) in primary care. The median age was 76 [interquartile range (IQR) 67-83] years and 27 546 (36.5%) patients were female. Key independent predictors of planned follow-up in specialty care included optimized HF care, that is follow-up in a nurse-led HF clinic [odds ratio (OR) 4.60, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 4.41-4.79], use of HF devices (OR 3.99, 95% CI 3.62-4.40), beta-blockers (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.32-1.47), renin-angiotensin system/angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.15-1.27), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.26-1.37); and more severe HF, that is higher NT-proBNP (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.20) and NYHA class (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.08-1.19). Factors associated with lower likelihood of follow-up in specialty care included older age (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.28-0.30), female sex (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.86-0.93), lower income (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.76-0.82) and educational level (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.73-0.81), higher EF [HFmrEF (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68) and HFpEF (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.53-0.58) vs. HFrEF], and higher comorbidity burden, such as presence of kidney disease (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87-0.95), atrial fibrillation (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81-0.89), and diabetes mellitus (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96). A planned follow-up in specialty care was independently associated with lower risk of all-cause [hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.76-0.80] and cardiovascular death (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.73-0.78) across the EF spectrum, but not of HF hospitalization (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.10). CONCLUSIONS: In a large nationwide HF population, referral to specialty care was linked with male sex, younger age, lower EF, lower comorbidity burden, better socioeconomic environment and optimized HF care, and associated with better survival across the EF spectrum. Our findings highlight the need for greater and more equal access to HF specialty care and improved quality of primary care.", "BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to improve outcomes and reduce costs for patients with heart failure (HF). Physician volume is associated with better outcomes for patients undergoing procedures, but its association with outcomes for medically managed diseases, such as HF, is not well understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used Medicare inpatient data in 2009 to examine all HF admissions to acute care hospitals in the United States. We divided physicians into quintiles according to their volume of patients with HF. We used patient-level regression to compare 30-day risk-adjusted mortality, readmissions, and costs across volume groups, controlling for patient, physician, and hospital characteristics. We examined physician volume within strata of hospital volume and physician specialty. Patients cared for by the high-volume physicians had lower mortality than those by the low-volume physicians (8.9% versus 9.7%; P<0.001); this relationship was strongest in low-volume hospitals. In contrast, patients cared for by high-volume physicians had higher readmission rates (25.8% versus 21.5%; P<0001); this relationship was similar across hospital volume groups. Finally, costs were higher for the high-volume physicians ($8982 versus $8731; P=0.002, a difference that was consistent across hospital volume groups). The relationship between physician volume and mortality was strongest for internists (9.2% versus 10.6%; P<0.001) and weakest for cardiologists (6.4% versus 6.7%; P=0.485). CONCLUSIONS: Physician volume is associated with lower mortality for HF, particularly in low-volume institutions and among noncardiologist physicians. Our findings suggest that clinician expertise may play an important role in HF care.", "IMPORTANCE: It is unclear how New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class compares with patient-reported outcomes among patients with heart failure (HF) in contemporary US clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To characterize longitudinal changes and concordance between NYHA class and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score (KCCQ-OS), and their associations with clinical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included 2872 US outpatients with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction across 145 practices enrolled in the CHAMP-HF registry between December 2015 and October 2017. All patients had complete NYHA class and KCCQ-OS data at baseline and 12 months. Longitudinal changes and correlations between the 2 measure were examined. Multivariable models landmarked at 12 months evaluated associations between improvement in NYHA and KCCQ-OS from baseline to 12 months with clinical outcomes occurring from months 12 through 24. Statistical analyses were performed from March to August 2020. EXPOSURE: Change in health status, as defined by 12-month change in NYHA class or KCCQ-OS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality, HF hospitalization, and mortality or HF hospitalization. RESULTS: In total, 2872 patients were included in this analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 68 [59-75] years; 872 [30.4%] were women; and 2156 [75.1%] were of White race). At baseline, 312 patients (10.9%) were NYHA class I, 1710 patients (59.5%) were class II, 804 patients (28.0%) were class III, and 46 patients (1.6%) were class IV. For KCCQ-OS, 1131 patients (39.4%) scored 75 to 100 (best health status), 967 patients (33.7%) scored 50 to 74, 612 patients (21.3%) scored 25 to 49, and 162 patients (5.6%) scored 0 to 24 (worst health status). At 12 months, 1002 patients (34.9%) had a change in NYHA class (599 [20.9%] with improvement; 403 [14.0%] with worsening) and 2158 patients (75.1%) had a change of 5 or more points in KCCQ-OS (1388 [48.3%] with improvement; 770 [26.8%] with worsening). The most common trajectory for NYHA class was no change (1870 [65.1%]), and the most common trajectory for KCCQ-OS was an improvement of at least 10 points (1047 [36.5%]). After adjustment, improvement in NYHA class was not associated with subsequent clinical outcomes, whereas an improvement of 5 or more points in KCCQ-OS was independently associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44-0.80; P < .001) and mortality or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.89; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings of this cohort study suggest that, in contemporary US clinical practice, compared with NYHA class, KCCQ-OS is more sensitive to clinically meaningful changes in health status over time. Changes in KCCQ-OS may have more prognostic value than changes in NYHA class.", "AIMS: Heart failure (HF) outcomes continue to improve with widespread use of new therapies. Concurrently, cancer survival has dramatically improved. Yet whether cancer patients share similar strategies and outcomes of inpatient HF treatment to those without HF is unknown. We sought to assess the contemporary impacts of cancer on inpatient HF outcomes over time. METHODS AND RESULTS: The retrospective National Inpatient Sample (2003-15) and National Readmissions Database (2013-14) registries were queried for adults admitted for HF and stratified for cancer status, excluding cases of metastatic disease. Temporal trends in HF admissions, hospital charge rates, length of hospitalization, HF-related procedure utilization, in-hospital mortality, and hospital readmissions were analysed. Over 13 years of follow-up, there were 12 769 077 HF admissions (mean age 73 years, 50.8% female, 30.8% non-White), among which 1 413 287 (11%) had a co-morbid cancer diagnosis. Cancer patients were older, were predominantly male, and tended to be smokers. Over time, HF admission rates among cancer patients increased, despite a concurrent decrease among patients without cancer (P < 0.0001). After propensity matching, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher among cancer HF patients (5.1% vs. 2.9%, P < 0.0001). Additionally, HF-related procedure utilization was disproportionately lower among cancer patients (0.30 vs. 0.35 procedures/HF hospitalization, P < 0.001); the presence of cancer was associated with increased costs, length of hospitalizations, and all-cause readmissions, but fewer HF readmissions (P < 0.0001, each). CONCLUSIONS: While the incidence of HF hospitalizations has increased among cancer patients, they do not appear to share the same rates of advanced HF care, readmissions trends, or reductions in in-hospital mortality. Future studies targeting modifiable factors related to these differences are needed."]}
{"question": "Can the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica be predicted at disease onset?", "retrieved_passages": ["DEFINITION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a very painful inflammatory disease which regularly affects the shoulder region but in 70% of cases the pelvic girdle region is also affected. The disease occurs in people over the age of 50 years and reaches a peak at 72 years old. Women are affected twice as often as men. The prevalence is estimated to be 0.3-0.7% in the Caucasian population over 50 years old. DIAGNOSTICS AND CLASSIFICATION: Misdiagnosis of PMR is common. The differential diagnosis primarily includes impingement syndrome, osteoarthritis of the shoulders, calcifying tendinitis of the rotator cuff, bursitis, omarthritis or inflammatory rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Taking a structured medical history and performing a thorough clinical examination are crucial. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are usually highly elevated and should be investigated particularly in patients who present with new onset bilateral shoulder pain and pronounced general impairment of movement. Imaging shows characteristic inflammatory changes around the shoulders and hip joints. The new European League Against Rheumatism and American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) classification criteria of PMR including ultrasound imaging are superior to previous classification and diagnostic criteria in terms of positive and negative predictive values. THERAPY: Glucocorticoids are still the mainstay of treatment. Recommended daily prednisolone starting doses are between 15 mg and 25 mg with a weekly dose reduction until 10 mg/day and then further dose reductions of 1 mg per month. Methotrexate can aid reducing prednisolone doses in patients who fail to reach doses below the Cushing threshold quickly enough, which can have major side effects.", "OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the frequency and characteristics of the peripheral musculoskeletal manifestations in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), evaluate if PMR with peripheral synovitis represents a subset with a more severe disease, and examine for clinical and laboratory characteristics at onset of PMR that might later predict rheumatoid arthritis (RA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were diagnosed with PMR according to the 1982 Chuang criteria. Patients were followed up between 1990 and 2002. The following musculoskeletal manifestations at onset and during the follow up were considered: peripheral synovitis, distal extremity swelling with pitting edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, and distal tenosynovitis. RESULTS: Thirty-eight of the 74 patients (51%) showed distal musculoskeletal symptoms: 29 (39%) had peripheral synovitis, 4 (5%) presented pitting edema, 4 (5%) experienced carpal tunnel syndrome, and one (1.3%) had distal tenosynovitis. These manifestations resolved completely after corticosteroid therapy was initiated. Peripheral synovitis was oligoarticular and often transient. The joints most frequently involved were the wrist, metacarpophalangeal, and knee. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was normal in 7 patients. When comparing patients with PMR with and without peripheral synovitis, no statistically significant differences were found in the studied variables. Through the first year of follow up, 7 patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology 1987 criteria for RA, 2 patients developed giant cell arteritis, and 3 had associated malignancy. Patients who developed RA had statistically significantly increased presence of persistent synovitis and a smaller decrease in mean ESR after treatment with corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: Fifty-one percent of the patients with PMR presented distal musculoskeletal manifestations, with peripheral synovitis being the most frequent one. Patients with PMR with peripheral synovitis did not represent a high-risk subgroup with more severe disease. Seven patients who developed criteria for seronegative RA within the first year of follow up had presented statistically significant persistent synovitis compared with those who continued as PMR and also showed a smaller initial decrease in mean ESR after steroid treatment was initiated. The absence of persistent arthritis and the benign course of the arthritis permit the distinction of PMR from other inflammatory arthropathies.", "Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory disease of individuals aged over 50 years. Because of the concomitant malignancy possibility and the high prevalence of constitutional symptoms seen in this condition, patients with classical clinical picture often experience delay in diagnosis and treatment and are exposed to a wide list of laboratory and imaging procedures. In this study, we aimed to explore the adventure these patients experience from symptom onset to rheumatology clinic. A total of 106 PMR patients (84 women, 22 men) mean age 70.1 +/- 8 were analyzed retrospectively. The time period from the onset of symptoms and referral to rheumatology specialists was explored. Diagnostic methods applied to these patients, antibiotic use and hospitalization during this period were recorded. The interval between the onset of the symptoms and admission to rheumatology unit was 13 +/- 13 months. In this period, abdominal computed tomography (29.2 %), chest computed tomography (21.7 %), cranial magnetic resonance imaging (18.9 %) and whole-body scintigraphy (3.8 %) were applied to the patients. About 30 % of the patients were hospitalized for a mean period of 7 +/- 3 days before referral to rheumatology unit, and 30 % of the patients were given antibiotics. In order to reduce the delay in the diagnosis of PMR and prevent unnecessary and expensive diagnostic methods, education of clinicians about the diagnosis of PMR may be beneficial.", "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the modulation of systemic levels of soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and soluble gp130 (sgp130) in untreated and treated polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) patients during a followup period of at least 24 months in order to evaluate the relationship of these molecules with clinical outcome and their feasibility to provide a prognostic tool in clinical practice. METHODS: We analyzed sIL-6R and sgp130 serum levels in 93 PMR patients, and 46 age-matched normal controls, at disease onset and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of followup during corticosteroid therapy by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: No difference in sIL-6R and sgp130 levels was observed between PMR patients and normal controls at disease onset or during followup. A significant correlation was found between the number of relapses and sIL-6R concentrations at baseline and after 1, 3, and 12 months of therapy. No correlation was found between sgp130 levels and the number of relapses. Cox multivariate analysis indicated that the best model for predicting relapses was identified by sIL-6R levels and the hemoglobin value at baseline. We found that high sIL-6R levels combined with low hemoglobin values resulted in a 10.1-fold increased risk of relapse. CONCLUSION: Our data support the identification of a potential prognostic marker of PMR outcome that might have important implications in clinical practice. Because targeting sIL-6R with blocking antibodies has proven useful in other rheumatic disorders, our results could suggest the opportunity to evaluate sIL-6R-blocking treatment in patients with PMR and elevated levels of sIL-6R at disease onset.", "OBJECTIVE: To identify the features of PMR that may predict the duration of steroid therapy, the occurrence of relapses and the late development of GCA. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 176 patients with PMR, followed up for 5 years. Baseline factors associated with the duration of steroids therapy were identified using Cox regression. Predictors of relapse and the late development of GCA were identified using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients with PMR were included, of whom 124 stopped steroids within 5 years. The probability of stopping steroids within 5 years was independently reduced by an elevated plasma viscosity (PV) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.49; 95% CI 0.29, 0.82 for a PV > or = 2.00 mPa s compared with a PV < or = 1.80 mPa s; overall P = 0.024] and by starting treatment at >15 mg prednisolone (HR = 0.63; 95% CI 0.41, 0.97; P = 0.036). Either of these independently reduced the chances of stopping steroids within a given time interval between 27 and 51%. No significant predictors of relapse were identified. Predictors of late GCA on univariable analysis were female sex [odds ratio (OR) = 8.16; 95% CI 1.06, 63.13; P = 0.044], HLA-DRB1*0101 or -*0401 alleles (OR = 4.95; 95% CI 1.05, 23.34; P = 0.043), PV > or = 2.00 mPa s compared with PV < or = 1.80 mPa s (OR = 10.64; 95% CI 1.28, 88.38; P = 0.029) and initial prednisolone dose >15 mg (OR = 4.53; 95% CI 1.61, 12.79; P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on >15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration."]}

{"question": "Are behavioural risk factors to be blamed for the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Longitudinal cohort studies in sub-Saharan Africa are urgently needed to understand cardiovascular disease development. We, therefore, explored health behaviours and conventional risk factors of African individuals with optimal blood pressure (BP) (</= 120/80 mm Hg), and their 5-year prediction for the development of hypertension. METHODS: The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology study in the North West Province, South Africa, started in 2005 and included African volunteers (n = 1994; aged > 30 years) from a sample of 6000 randomly selected households in rural and urban areas. RESULTS: At baseline, 48% of the participants were hypertensive (>/= 140/90 mmHg). Those with optimal BP (n = 478) were followed at a success rate of 70% for 5 years (213 normotensive, 68 hypertensive, 57 deceased). Africans that became hypertensive smoked more than the normotensive individuals (68.2% vs 49.8%), and they also had a greater waist circumference [ratio of geometric means of 0.94 cm (95% CI: 0.86-0.99)] and greater amount of gamma-glutamyltransferase [0.74 U/l (95% CI: 0.62-0.88)] at baseline. The 5-year change in BP was independently explained by baseline gamma-glutamyltransferase [R(2) = 0.23, beta = 0.13 U/l (95% CI: 0.01-0.19)]. Alcohol intake also predicted central systolic BP and carotid cross-sectional wall area (CSWA) at follow-up. Waist circumference was another predictor of BP changes [beta = 0.18 cm (95% CI: 0.05-0.24)] and CSWA. HIV infection was inversely associated with increased BP. CONCLUSIONS: During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system."]}
{"question": "Is oral endotracheal intubation efficacy impaired in the helicopter environment?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: Patients transported by helicopter often require advanced airway management. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not the in-flight environment of air medical transport in a BO-105 helicopter impairs the ability of flight nurses to perform oral endotracheal intubation. SETTING: The study was conducted in an MBB BO-105 helicopter. METHODS: Flight nurses performed three manikin intubations in each of the two study environments: on an emergency department stretcher and in-flight in the BO-105 helicopter. RESULTS: The mean time required for in-flight intubation (25.9 +/- 10.9 seconds) was significantly longer than the corresponding time (13.2 +/- 2.8 seconds) required for intubation in the control setting (ANOVA, F = 38.7, p < .001). All intubations performed in the control setting were placed correctly in the trachea; there were two (6.7%) esophageal intubations in the in-flight setting. The difference in appropriate endotracheal intubation between the two settings was not significant (chi 2 = 0.3; p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oral endotracheal intubation in the in-flight setting of the BO-105 helicopter takes approximately twice as long as intubation in a ground setting. The results support pre-flight intubation of patients who appear likely to require urgent intubation during air medical transport in the BO-105 helicopter."]}
{"question": "Telemedicine and type 1 diabetes: is technology per se sufficient to improve glycaemic control?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: In the TELEDIAB-1 study, the Diabeo system (a smartphone coupled to a website) improved HbA1c by 0.9% vs controls in patients with chronic, poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. The system provided two main functions: automated advice on the insulin doses required; and remote monitoring by teleconsultation. The question is: how much did each function contribute to the improvement in HbA1c? METHODS: Each patient received a smartphone with an insulin dose advisor (IDA) and with (G3 group) or without (G2 group) the telemonitoring/teleconsultation function. Patients were classified as \"high users\" if the proportion of \"informed\" meals using the IDA exceeded 67% (median) and as \"low users\" if not. Also analyzed was the respective impact of the IDA function and teleconsultations on the final HbA1c levels. RESULTS: Among the high users, the proportion of informed meals remained stable from baseline to the end of the study 6months later (from 78.1+/-21.5% to 73.8+/-25.1%; P=0.107), but decreased in the low users (from 36.6+/-29.4% to 26.7+/-28.4%; P=0.005). As expected, HbA1c improved in high users from 8.7% [range: 8.3-9.2%] to 8.2% [range: 7.8-8.7%] in patients with (n=26) vs without (n=30) the benefit of telemonitoring/teleconsultation (-0.49+/-0.60% vs -0.52+/-0.73%, respectively; P=0.879). However, although HbA1c also improved in low users from 9.0% [8.5-10.1] to 8.5% [7.9-9.6], those receiving support via teleconsultation tended to show greater improvement than the others (-0.93+/-0.97 vs -0.46+/-1.05, respectively; P=0.084). CONCLUSION: The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations."]}
{"question": "Are hepatitis G virus and TT virus involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Hepatitis G virus can cause chronic infection in man but the role of this agent in chronic liver disease is poorly understood. Little is known about the relation of another newly discovered agent, the TT virus, with chronic liver disease. AIM: To investigate the rate of infection with hepatitis G virus and TT virus in patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease. PATIENTS: A total of 23 subjects with chronically raised alanine transaminase and a liver biopsy in whom all known causes of liver disease had been excluded, and 40 subjects with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. METHODS: Evaluation of anti-hepatitis G virus by enzyme immunoassay. Hepatitis G virus-RNA by polymerase chain reaction with primers from the 5' NC and NS5a regions. TT virus-DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction with primers from the ORF1 region. Results. Hepatitis G virus-RNA was detected in 4 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis and in 6 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis (17.4% vs 15% p=ns). At least one marker of hepatitis G virus infection (hepatitis G virus-RNA and/or anti-hepatitis G virus, mostly mutually exclusive) was present in 6 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic hepatitis and 16 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus liver disease (26. 1% vs 40% p=ns). T virus-DNA was present in serum in 3 subjects, 1 with cryptogenic and 2 with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. Demographic and clinical features, including stage and grade of liver histology, were comparable between hepatitis G virus-infected and uninfected subjects. Severe liver damage [chronic hepatitis with fibrosis or cirrhosis) were significantly more frequent in subjects with hepatitis C virus liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure."]}
{"question": "Do older patients who refuse to participate in a self-management intervention in the Netherlands differ from older patients who agree to participate?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Refusal of patients to participate in intervention programs is an important problem in clinical trials but, in general, researchers devote relatively little attention to it. In this article, a comparison is made between patients who, after having been invited, agreed to participate in a self-management intervention (participants) and those who refused (refusers). Compared with other studies of refusers, relatively more information could be gathered with regard to both their characteristics and reasons for refusing, because all potential participants were invited personally. METHODS: Older patients from a Dutch outpatient clinic were invited to participate in a self-management intervention, and their characteristics were assessed. Demographic data were collected, as well as data on physical functioning and lack of emotional support. People who refused to participate were asked to give their reasons for refusing. RESULTS: Of the 361 patients invited, 267 (74%) refused participation. These refusers were more restricted in their mobility, lived further away from the location of the intervention, and had a partner more often than did the participants. No differences were found in level of education, age or gender. The main reasons given by respondents for refusing to participate were lack of time, travel distance, and transport problems. CONCLUSIONS: As in many studies, the refusal rate in this study is high, and seems to be related to physical mobility restrictions, travel distance and, partly, to availability of emotional support. These findings may be used to make the recruitment process more effective - for example, by offering transport to the location of the intervention.", "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-supported self-management programme to improve social participation of dual sensory impaired older adults in long-term care homes. DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Thirty long-term care homes across the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Long-term care homes were randomised into intervention clusters (n=17) and control clusters (n=13), involving 89 dual sensory impaired older adults and 56 licensed practical nurses. INTERVENTION: Nurse-supported self-management programme. MEASUREMENTS: Effectiveness was evaluated by the primary outcome social participation using a participation scale adapted for visually impaired older adults distinguishing four domains: instrumental activities of daily living, social-cultural activities, high-physical-demand and low-physical-demand leisure activities. A questionnaire assessing hearing-related participation problems was added as supportive outcome. Secondary outcomes were autonomy, control, mood and quality of life and nurses' job satisfaction. For effectiveness analyses, linear mixed models were used. Sampling and intervention quality were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Self-management did not affect all four domains of social participation; however. the domain 'instrumental activities of daily living' had a significant effect in favour of the intervention group (P=0.04; 95% CI 0.12 to 8.5). Sampling and intervention quality was adequate. CONCLUSIONS: A nurse-supported self-management programme was effective in empowering the dual sensory impaired older adults to address the domain 'instrumental activities of daily living', but no differences were found in addressing the other three participation domains. Self-management showed to be beneficial for managing practical problems, but not for those problems requiring behavioural adaptations of other persons. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01217502; Results.", "PURPOSE OF STUDY: The first aim is to evaluate, in a sub-study, the recruitment process of the Senior Step Study, which was an intervention study on the self-management of mobility and fall risk; the second aim is to explore the reasons mentioned by older people, from three different settings, for (not) participating. METHODS: Subjects were community-dwelling older persons, residents of homes for the elderly, and older persons regularly visiting community centres. The effectiveness of different recruitment procedures was analysed for each setting separately. We also analysed reasons for accepting and declining participation between the settings. RESULTS: The total inclusion rate was 27.9%. A personal initial approach (i.e., first contact was face-to-face or in a group meeting) did not improve the inclusion rate. More subjects consented to participate after an introductory meeting (which was planned after the first face-to-face contact) compared to persons not having one (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). At different settings, subjects gave different reasons for participation. No differences were found in the reasons for refusing participation. Especially in homes for the elderly, people refused to participate because the research was too burdensome. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion rates in this study are comparable to other self-management studies with older people. An introductory meeting during which the study design and benefits of participating are explained and formal interim evaluations of the recruitment process may benefit recruitment. Recruiting older persons for self-management tasks is possible with the appropriate recruitment process, enabling more research on this increasingly important research topic.", "BACKGROUND: Little attention has been paid to self-management support of patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Most studies evaluated the addition of self-management support to regular diabetes care, but self-management as an alternative for part of regular diabetes care has hardly been studied. In this study, we offered patients with well-controlled T2DM the opportunity to perform the 3 quarterly monitoring sessions at home using an Internet-based self-management program, resulting in online personalized advice. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to assess the reach and feasibility of an Internet-based diabetes self-management support program for patients with well-controlled T2DM, addressing both primary care providers' (PCPs) opinions and patients' willingness to participate in such a support program. METHODS: PCPs assessed patients' eligibility for Internet-based self-management, and patients were offered the opportunity to participate. Characteristics of eligible and ineligible patients were compared, as well as those of participants and nonparticipants, also with regard to quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and illness perceptions. Multivariate logistic regression models were performed and odds ratios (ORs) calculated with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Almost half (128/282, 45.4%) of the patients with well-controlled T2DM were considered ineligible by their PCPs mainly because of cognitive impairment and language barriers (8.2% and 8.9%). Older patients (OR for each year 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09, P<.001), non-Western European patients (OR 3.64, 95% CI 1.67-7.92, P=.001), and patients with a longer diabetes duration (OR for each year 1.56, 95% CI 1.04-2.34, P=.03) were more often regarded as ineligible. Of the 154 patients considered eligible, 57 (37.0%) consented to participate and 30 (10.6%) started the program. Of 57 participants, 45 returned the 3 questionnaires; 21 of 97 nonparticipants returned the questionnaires. Nonparticipants less often thought that their disease would last their entire life (median 8.0 vs 10.0, P=.03) and they were more satisfied with their current treatment than participants (DTSQ total score 44.0 vs 40.0, P=.05). There was no significant difference in quality of life between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs considered half of their patients with well-controlled T2DM incapable of Internet-based self-management mainly because of cognitive impairment and language barriers; of the selected patients, about 1 out of 3 was willing to participate. Older patients, non-Western European patients, and patients with a higher BMI were less likely to participate. Predominantly, practical issues (such as Internet problems) hindered implementation of the Internet-based self-management program.", "BACKGROUND: Although widespread problems in patient-professional interaction and insufficient support of patients' self-management abilities have been recognized, research investigating the relationships among care quality, productive interaction, and self-management abilities to maintain overall well-being is lacking. Furthermore, studies have revealed differences in these characteristics among certain groups (e.g., less-educated and older patients). This longitudinal study thus aimed to identify relationships among background characteristics, quality of care, productivity of patient-professional interaction, and self-management abilities to maintain overall well-being in chronically ill patients participating in 18 Dutch disease management programs. METHODS: This longitudinal study included patients participating in 18 Dutch disease management programs. Surveys were administered in 2011 (T1; n = 2191 (out of 4693), 47 % response rate) and 2012 (T2: n = 1722 (out of 4350), 40 % response rate). A total of 1279 patients completed questionnaires at both timepoints (T1 and T2) (27 % response rate). Self-management abilities to maintain well-being were measured using the short (18-item) version of the Self-Management Ability Scale (SMAS-S), patients' perceptions of the productivity of interactions with health care professionals were assessed with the relational coordination instrument and the short (11-item) version of the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC-S) was used to assess patients' perceptions of the quality of chronic care delivery. RESULTS: Perceived and objective quality of care and the productivity of patient-professional interaction were found to be related to patients' self-management abilities to maintain overall well-being. These abilities were related negatively to and significantly predicted by low educational level, single status, and older age, despite the mediating role of productive interaction in their relationship with patients' perceptions of care quality. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that patient-professional interaction is not yet sufficiently productive to successfully protect against the deterioration of self-management abilities in some groups of chronically ill patients, although such interaction and high-quality care are important factors in such protection. Improvement of the quality of chronic care delivery should thus always be accompanied by investment in high-quality communication and patient-professional relationships."]}
{"question": "Preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer: is there a place for magnetic resonance imaging?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer. METHODS: This study had Institutional Review Board approval, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Fifty-two patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer underwent preoperative 1.5-T MRI, 64-channel MDCT and EUS. All images were analysed blind, and the results were compared with histopathological findings according to the seventh edition of the TNM classification. After the population had been divided on the basis of the local invasion (T1-3 vs T4a-b) and nodal involvement (N0 vs N+), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated and diagnostic performance measures were assessed using the McNemar test. RESULTS: For T staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (94%) than MDCT and MRI (65 and 76%; p = 0.02 and p = 0.08). MDCT and MRI had significantly higher specificity (91 and 89%) than EUS (60%) (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.003). Adding MRI to MDCT or EUS did not result in significant differences for sensitivity. For N staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (92%) than MRI and MDCT (69 and 73%; p = 0.01 and p = 0.02). MDCT showed better specificity (81%) than EUS and MRI (58 and 73%; p = 0.03 and p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective study confirmed the leading role of EUS and MDCT in the staging of gastric cancer and did not prove, at present, the value of the clinical use of MRI.", "A more differentiated therapy regimen concept for gastric cancer requires more precise pre-operative diagnostic imaging. There are several methods for pre-operative locoregional tumor staging in gastric cancer: percutaneous abdominal ultrasound with hydrotechnique (HUS), endoluminal ultrasound in the stomach (EUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The advantages and indications for each method are described and an overview of the medical literature is given. The results in the literature are compared to our own findings, which were obtained in prospective studies comparing the four different imaging methods. On the basis of our experience and the literature, we conclude that the indication for the different diagnostic imaging methods primarily depends on the type of therapy concept followed in the respective surgical department. Endoscopy with biopsy remains the primary diagnostic procedure. Endosonography (EUS) is another diagnostic procedure, which can be performed simultaneously with endoscopy. Only special questions or reasons warrant the use of other imaging methods.", "Gastric cancer is one of the most common and fatal cancers. The importance of accurate staging for gastric cancer has become more critical due to the recent introduction of less invasive treatment options, such as endoscopic mucosal resection or laparoscopic surgery. The tumor-node-metastasis staging system is the generally accepted staging system for predicting the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. Multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) is a widely accepted imaging modality for the preoperative staging of gastric cancer that can simultaneously assess locoregional staging, including the gastric mass, regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis. The diagnostic performance of MDCT for T- and N-staging has been improved by the technical development of isotropic imaging and 3D reformation. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not previously used to evaluate gastric cancer due to the modality's limitations, the development of high-speed sequences has made MRI a feasible tool for the staging of gastric cancer.", "PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy of Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in the preoperative staging of gastric cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2002 and October 2002, 27 patents with histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma underwent MDCT. Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT scans were obtained after the oral administration of 400-600 ml of water for gastric wall distension. Biphasic enhanced scans were performed after the automatic injection of 2ml/kg of contrast agent at a flow rate of 3.5 ml/sec with a scan delay of 35 and 70 sec. The images were evaluated for: lesion morphology, degree of wall infiltration, presence of locoregional lymphadenopathies and distant metastases. Based on the findings, a TCMD staging system was established according to the criteria reported in the literature. All the patients underwent surgery, and the preoperative MDCT staging was evaluated against the pathology findings. RESULTS: MDCT staging was correct in 17/27 patients (62.9%). The T parameter was correctly assessed in 24/27 cases (88.9%), whereas it was understaged in 1 case (3.7%) (T1 stage at CT vs T2 at surgery) and overstaged in 2 cases (7.4%) (T3 vs T2). The N parameter was correctly evaluated in 19/27 patients (70.4%), understaged in 6/27 (22.2%) and overstaged in 2/27 (7.4%). CONCLUSIONS: MDCT may be proposed for the staging of gastric carcinomas and, although accuracy in N staging remains low in comparison to single-detector spiral CT, it provides a larger amount of diagnostic information."]}
{"question": "Can bedside assessment reliably exclude aspiration following acute stroke?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of a bedside swallowing assessment to reliably exclude aspiration following acute stroke. SUBJECTS: Consecutive patients admitted within 24 h of stroke onset to two hospitals. METHODS: A prospective study. Where possible, all patients had their ability to swallow assessed on the day of admission by both a doctor and a speech and language therapist using a standardized proforma. A videofluoroscopy examination was conducted within 3 days of admission. RESULTS: 94 patients underwent videofluoroscopy; 20 (21%) were seen to be aspirating, although this was not detected at the bedside in 10. In 18 (22%) of the patients the speech and language therapist considered the swallow to be unsafe. In the medical assessment, 39 patients (41%) had an unsafe swallow. Bedside assessment by a speech and language therapist gave a sensitivity of 47%, a specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 85% for the presence of aspiration. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify the optimum elements of the bedside assessments for predicting the presence of aspiration. A weak voluntary cough and any alteration in conscious level gave a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 72%, PPV of 41% and NPV of 91% for aspiration. CONCLUSION: Bedside assessment of swallowing lacks the necessary sensitivity to be used as a screening instrument in acute stroke, but there are concerns about the use of videofluoroscopy as a gold standard. The relative importance of aspiration and bedside assessment in predicting complications and outcome needs to be studied."]}
{"question": "Are UK radiologists satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: To determine current practice and perceptions of the adequacy of training and support received for the reporting of skeletal surveys in suspected physical child abuse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A list of telephone numbers of UK hospitals with a radiology department was obtained from the Royal College of Radiologists. One hundred hospitals were then randomly selected for inclusion in the survey. An 18-item questionnaire was successfully administered to consultant radiologists from 84 departments. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of departments had a named radiologist to report their skeletal surveys, 16% assigned surveys to a random radiologist, and 23% referred them elsewhere. Only 52% of departments had a dedicated paediatric radiologist, thus in a significant proportion of departments (25%) initial reports on skeletal surveys for physical abuse were provided by non-paediatric radiologists. Fifteen percent did not have ready access to a paediatric radiology opinion. Sixty-one percent thought that the service could be improved. Expert evidence was provided by 5% of respondents. Seventy-three percent would never consider providing expert evidence, even if given adequate radiology and/or legal training. CONCLUSION: The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented."]}
{"question": "Are wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation equivalent?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The authors examined equivalence of wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation (PNA) as concepts. DESIGN: A cross-sectional correlational design was used. SETTING: Participants were recruited from 22 nursing homes and 6 assisted living facilities in two states. PARTICIPANTS: Ambulatory residents meeting DSM-IV criteria for dementia (N = 181) were studied. MEASUREMENTS: Video-tapes for up to twelve 20-minute observations per participant were coded for wandering using an empirically derived taxonomy of ambulation patterns. Separate raters coded the same tapes for six PNA behaviors on the agitation behavior mapping instrument. RESULTS: Most participants (73.5%) wandered; all showed PNA behaviors. Factor analyses yielded an one-factor solution for wandering (explained variance = 43.66%) and a two-factor solution for PNA (explained variance = 53.45%). Overall wandering correlated significantly with PNA Factor 1 (df =179, r = 0.68, p <0.001) and Factor 2, but at a lower value (df = 179, r = 0.26, p <0.01). CONCLUSION: Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation."]}
{"question": "Is size-reducing ascending aortoplasty with external reinforcement an option in modern aortic surgery?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Enlargement of the ascending aorta is often combined with valvular, coronary, or other cardiac diseases. Reduction aortoplasty can be an optional therapy; however, indications regarding the diameter of aorta, the history of dilatation (poststenosis, bicuspid aortic valve), or the intraoperative management (wall excision, reduction suture, external reinforcement) are not established. METHODS: In a retrospective study between 1997 and 2005, we investigated 531 patients operated for aneurysm or ectasia of the ascending aorta (diameter: 45-76mm). Of these, in 50 patients, size-reducing ascending aortoplasty was performed. External reinforcement with a non-coated dacron prosthesis was added in order to stabilize the aortic wall. RESULTS: Aortoplasty was associated with aortic valve replacement in 47 cases (35 mechanical vs 12 biological), subvalvular myectomy in 29 cases, and CABG in 13 cases. The procedure was performed with low hospital mortality (2%) and a low postoperative morbidity. Computertomographic and echocardiographic diameters were significantly smaller after reduction (55.8+/-9mm down to 40.51+/-6.2mm (CT), p<0.002; 54.1+/-6.7mm preoperatively down to 38.7+/-7.1mm (echocardiography), p<0.002), with stable performance in long-term follow-up (mean follow-up time: 70 months). CONCLUSIONS: As demonstrated in this study, size reduction of the ascending aorta using aortoplasty with external reinforcement is a safe procedure with excellent long-term results. It is a therapeutic option in modern aortic surgery in patients with poststenotic dilatation of the aorta without impairment of the sinotubular junction of the aortic valve and root."]}
{"question": "Does depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Studies have linked ethnic differences in depression rates with neighbourhood ethnic density although results have not been conclusive. We looked at this using a novel approach analysing whole population data covering just over one million GP patients in four London boroughs. METHOD: Using a dataset of GP records for all patients registered in Lambeth, Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Newham in 2013 we investigated new diagnoses of depression and antidepressant use for: Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, black Caribbean and black African patients. Neighbourhood effects were assessed independently of GP practice using a cross-classified multilevel model. RESULTS: Black and minority ethnic groups are up to four times less likely to be newly diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants compared to white British patients. We found an inverse relationship between neighbourhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis for some groups, where an increase of 10% own-ethnic density was associated with a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduced odds of depression for Pakistani [odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.93], Indian (OR 0.88, CI 0.81-0.95), African (OR 0.88, CI 0.78-0.99) and Bangladeshi (OR 0.94, CI 0.90-0.99) patients. Black Caribbean patients, however, showed the opposite effect (OR 1.26, CI 1.09-1.46). The results for antidepressant use were very similar although the corresponding effect for black Caribbeans was no longer statistically significant (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups."]}
{"question": "Can routinely collected ambulance data about assaults contribute to reduction in community violence?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The 'law of spatiotemporal concentrations of events' introduced major preventative shifts in policing communities. 'Hotspots' are at the forefront of these developments yet somewhat understudied in emergency medicine. Furthermore, little is known about interagency 'data-crossover', despite some developments through the Cardiff Model. Can police-ED interagency data-sharing be used to reduce community-violence using a hotspots methodology? METHODS: 12-month (2012) descriptive study and analysis of spatiotemporal clusters of police and emergency calls for service using hotspots methodology and assessing the degree of incident overlap. 3775 violent crime incidents and 775 assault incidents analysed using spatiotemporal clustering with k-means++ algorithm and Spearman's rho. RESULTS: Spatiotemporal location of calls for services to the police and the ambulance service are equally highly concentrated in a small number of geographical areas, primarily within intra-agency hotspots (33% and 53%, respectively) but across agencies' hotspots as well (25% and 15%, respectively). Datasets are statistically correlated with one another at the 0.57 and 0.34 levels, with 50% overlap when adjusted for the number of hotspots. At least one in every two police hotspots does not have an ambulance hotspot overlapping with it, suggesting half of assault spatiotemporal concentrations are unknown to the police. Data further suggest that more severely injured patients, as estimated by transfer to hospital, tend to be injured in the places with the highest number of police-recorded crimes. CONCLUSIONS: A hotspots approach to sharing data circumvents the problem of disclosing person-identifiable data between different agencies. Practically, at least half of ambulance hotspots are unknown to the police; if causal, it suggests that data sharing leads to both reduced community violence by way of prevention (such as through anticipatory patrols or problem-oriented policing), particularly of more severe assaults, and improved efficiency of resource deployment."]}
{"question": "Volume change of uterine myomas during pregnancy: do myomas really grow?", "retrieved_passages": ["STUDY OBJECTIVE: To estimate changes in uterine myoma volume during pregnancy. DESIGN: Review of departmental electronic perinatal database and medical records. Canadian Task Force Classification II-3. SETTING: Obstetrical ultrasound unit in an academic tertiary care center. PATIENTS: One hundred-seven patients diagnosed with uterine myomas during pregnancy and who had two or more obstetrical ultrasounds in different periods of pregnancy. INTERVENTIONS: We analyzed the change in volume of uterine myomas between the first half of pregnancy (up until 19 weeks), third quarter (20-30 weeks), and last quarter (31 weeks to term). The volume of largest uterine myoma was calculated using the formula Volume (mm3)=Pi/6x(length mm)x(width mm)x(height mm). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean age of the population was 31+/-6 years. Between the first and the second study periods, the percentage of uterine myomas that decreased in size was 55.1% (95% CI: 43-66), with a mean decrease in volume of 35%+/-4%; while the percentage of uterine myomas that enlarged was 44.9% (95% CI: 34-56), with a mean increase in volume of 69%+/-11%. Between the second and the third study periods, 75% (95% CI: 56-87) became smaller, with a mean decrease in volume of 30%+/-3%; while 25% (95% CI: 13-43) enlarged, with a mean increase in volume of 102%+/-62%. CONCLUSION: Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy."]}
{"question": "Upstream solutions: does the supplemental security income program reduce disability in the elderly?", "retrieved_passages": ["CONTEXT: The robust relationship between socioeconomic factors and health suggests that social and economic policies might substantially affect health, while other evidence suggests that medical care, the main focus of current health policy, may not be the primary determinant of population health. Income support policies are one promising avenue to improve population health. This study examines whether the federal cash transfer program to poor elderly, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, affects old-age disability. METHODS: This study uses the 1990 and 2000 censuses, employing state and year fixed-effect models, to test whether within-state changes in maximum SSI benefits over time lead to changes in disability among people aged sixty-five and older. FINDINGS: Higher benefits are linked to lower disability rates. Among all single elderly individuals, 30 percent have mobility limitations, and an increase of $100 per month in the maximum SSI benefit caused the rate of mobility limitations to fall by 0.46 percentage points. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. First, analyses limited to those most likely to receive SSI produced larger effects, but analyses limited to those least likely to receive SSI produced no measurable effect. Second, varying the disability measure did not meaningfully alter the findings. Third, excluding the institutionalized, immigrants, individuals living in states with exceptionally large benefit changes, and individuals living in states with no SSI supplements did not change the substantive conclusions. Fourth, Medicaid did not confound the effects. Finally, these results were robust for married individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health."]}

{"question": "Will CT ordering practices change if we educate residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure?", "retrieved_passages": ["RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine if educating residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure from computed tomographic (CT) imaging alters ordering patterns. This study also explored whether referring physicians are interested in radiation education and was an initial effort to address their CT ordering behavior. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two to four months after a radiologist's lecture on the potential effects of radiation exposure related to CT scans, urology and orthopedic residents were surveyed regarding the number and types of CT scans they ordered, the use of alternative imaging modalities, and whether they used the lecture information to educate patients. RESULTS: Twenty-one resident lecture attendants completed the survey. The number of CT scans ordered after the lecture stayed constant for 90% (19 of 21) and decreased for 10% (two of 21). The types of CT scans ordered changed after the lecture for 14% (three of 21). Thirty-three percent (seven of 21) reported increases in alternative imaging after the lecture, including 24% (five of 21) reporting increases in magnetic resonance imaging and 19% (four of 21) reporting increases in ultrasound. Patients directed questions about radiation exposure to 57% (12 of 21); 38% (eight of 21) used the lecture information to educate patients. Referring physicians were interested in the topic, and afterward, other physician groups requested radiation education lectures. CONCLUSIONS: Most clinicians did not change their CT scan ordering after receiving education about radiation from a radiologist. Radiation education allowed clinicians to discuss CT benefits and risks with their patients and to choose appropriate CT protocols. Referring physician groups are interested in this topic, and radiologists should be encouraged to give radiation lectures to them."]}
{"question": "Does stress increase imitation of drinking behavior?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: That alcohol consumption is strongly influenced by the drinking behavior of social company has been demonstrated in observational research. However, not everyone is equally vulnerable to other people's drinking, and it is important to unravel which factors underlie these individual differences. This study focuses on the role of psychosocial stress in attempting to explain individual differences in the propensity to imitate alcohol consumption. METHODS: With a 2 (confederate's drinking condition: alcohol vs. soda) x 2 (participant's stress condition: stress vs. no stress) experimental design, we tested whether the tendency to imitate other people's drinking was related to participants' induced stress levels. The young male adults (N = 106) were randomly assigned to each of the conditions. In each session, directly after the stress or no-stress period, confederates and participants entered a bar laboratory where we observed their drinking behavior. Prior to entering the session, confederates were instructed to drink alcohol or soda. RESULTS: Participants in both stress and no-stress conditions consumed substantially more alcohol when confederates drank alcohol than when they drank soda. There was no difference in alcohol consumed between stress and no-stress conditions. No moderating effect of stress on the tendency to drink along with peers was found. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, it appears that among young male adults, imitation of alcohol consumption is a robust phenomenon not dependent on individual stress levels.", "BACKGROUND: Adolescent smoking and drinking are influenced by parental supervision. This study aimed to investigate the gap in adolescent smoking and drinking experience rates and age at initiation according to maternal working hours. METHODS: Data from 1,580 adolescents aged 12-18 years and 1,172 working mothers of double-parent or single-mother households were selected from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) VI & VII data. Figures on adolescents' smoking and drinking rates and their ages at imitation were used. Maternal working hours were divided into < 40 hours, 40-52 hours, and > 52 hours to analyze whether smoking and drinking experience rates and age at initiation differ according to maternal working hours and by the child's sex. Maternal age, education level, household income, occupation, shift work, current smoking status, monthly drinking frequency and child's obesity, stress recognition and depressive mood were adjusted for in the statistical analyses. RESULTS: The odds for adolescents' smoking behavior were significantly higher with increasing maternal working hours in boys but not in girls. The odds for adolescents' drinking behavior were not significantly higher in both boys and girls. Regardless of the child's sex, there were no significant differences in the age of smoking and drinking initiation according to maternal working hours. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents of mothers who work long hours are at a higher risk of being exposed to smoking. Thus, our society needs to share the burden of raising children, which is concentrated on women, and employers and governments should support policies that can help prevent long working hours.", "This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate whether COVID-19 had an impact on people's (aged 18-74) physical activity distribution, eating, and alcohol consumption habits as well as body mass index. We interviewed 6369 people (4545 women and 1824 men) in Lithuania before the COVID-19 pandemic started and 2392 during COVID-19 (1856 women and 536 men). They were aged 18-74 years. We found that both genders had not stopped their physical activity (PA) completely because of lockdown imitations (for example, prohibition from attending sport clubs), but they started doing different physical exercises at sport clubs. We determined the PA distribution according to the Danish Physical Activity Questionnaire (DPAQ). Despite increases in independent PA and the quantity of light PA, the amount of total energy used in metabolic equivalent of task (MET) units per day decreased significantly for both genders irrespective of age. Although the amounts of sedentary behavior, moderate PA (MPA), vigorous PA (VPA) or a combination of MPA and VPA (MVPA) did not change significantly. Surprisingly, lockdown reduced the duration of sleep for older women but increased their amount of intense VPA (>6 METs). However, the amount of intense VPA decreased for men. Both genders reported overeating less during the pandemic than before it, but did not start consuming more alcohol, and their body mass index did not change. Thus, the COVID-19 in Lithuania represented 'good stress' that mobilized these individuals to exercise more independently and overeat less."]}
{"question": "Can decisional algorithms replace global introspection in the individual causality assessment of spontaneously reported ADRs?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: The usefulness of algorithms for assessing the causality of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has yet to be established and, since the validation of causality algorithms depends upon their sensitivity and specificity, our study was carried out to evaluate these measures. METHOD: In this study, an expert panel assessed causality of adverse reports by using the WHO global introspection (GI) method. The same reports were independently assessed using 15 published algorithms. The causality assessment level 'possible' was considered the lower limit for a report to be considered to be drug related. For a given algorithm, sensitivity was determined by the proportion of reports simultaneously classified as drug related by the algorithm and the GI method. Specificity was measured as the proportion of reports simultaneously considered non-drug related. The analysis was performed for the total sample and within serious or unexpected events. RESULTS: Five hundred adverse reports were studied. Algorithms presented high rates of sensitivity (average of 93%, positive predictive value of 89%) and low rates of specificity (average of 7%, negative predictive value of 31%). CONCLUSION: Decisional algorithms are sensitive methods for the detection of ADRs, but they present poor specificity. A reference method was not identified. Algorithms do not replace GI and are not definite alternatives in the individual causality assessment of suspected ADRs."]}
{"question": "Does timing of initial surfactant treatment make a difference in rates of chronic lung disease or mortality in premature infants?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To compare two treatment strategies in preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome: early surfactant administration (within one hour of birth) versus late surfactant administration, in a geographically defined population. OUTCOME: The primary outcome was chronic lung disease (CLD) and mortality before/at 36 weeks. Secondary outcomes included: duration of mechanical ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), post-natal steroids for CLD and major neonatal morbidities. SUBJECTS: Premature infants born at 22-32 weeks' gestation between January 2006 and December 2009. SETTING: Ten neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in New South Wales (NSW) and Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Australia. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the regional NICU database in NSW and ACT. RESULTS: Of the 2170 infants who received surfactant, 1182 (54.5%) and 988 (45.5%) received early and late surfactant, respectively. The early surfactant group was less mature (27.1 +/- 2.1 versus 29.4 +/- 2.1 weeks) and had more CLD and mortality (40.2% versus 20.0%). The multivariable analysis showed early surfactant to be associated with less duration of ventilation, longer duration of CPAP and longer hospital stay but had little or no impact on CLD/mortality. CONCLUSION: Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "Premature birth is a significant cause of infant and child morbidity and mortality. In the United States, the premature birth rate, which had steadily increased during the 1990s and early 2000s, has decreased annually for 7 years and is now approximately 11.39%. Human viability, defined as gestational age at which the chance of survival is 50%, is currently approximately 23 to 24 weeks in developed countries. Infant girls, on average, have better outcomes than infant boys. A relatively uncomplicated course in the intensive care nursery for an extremely premature infant results in a discharge date close to the prenatal estimated date of confinement. Despite technological advances and efforts of child health experts during the last generation, the extremely premature infant (less than 28 weeks gestation) and extremely low birth weight infant (<1000 g) remain at high risk for death and disability with 30% to 50% mortality and, in survivors, at least 20% to 50% risk of morbidity. The introduction of continuous positive airway pressure, mechanical ventilation, and exogenous surfactant increased survival and spurred the development of neonatal intensive care in the 1970s through the early 1990s. Routine administration of antenatal steroids during premature labor improved neonatal mortality and morbidity in the late 1990s. The recognition that chronic postnatal administration of steroids to infants should be avoided may have improved outcomes in the early 2000s. Evidence from recent trials attempting to define the appropriate target for oxygen saturation in preterm infants suggests arterial oxygen saturation between 91% and 95% (compared with 85%-89%) avoids excess mortality; however, final analyses of data from these trials have not been published, so definitive recommendations are still pending. The development of neonatal neurocritical intensive care units may improve neurocognitive outcomes in this high-risk group. Long-term follow-up to detect and address developmental, learning, behavioral, and social problems is critical for children born at these early gestational ages.The striking similarities in response to extreme prematurity in the lung and brain imply that agents and techniques that benefit one organ are likely to also benefit the other. Finally, because therapy and supportive care continue to change, the outcomes of extremely low birth weight infants are ever evolving. Efforts to minimize injury, preserve growth, and identify interventions focused on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways are now being evaluated. Thus, treating and preventing long-term deficits must be developed in the context of a \"moving target.\"", "OBJECTIVE: To examine if timing of tracheostomy placement in premature infants affects the rates of decannulation and length of time required for mechanical ventilatory support. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive case series with chart review of premature patients born at a gestational age of 36 weeks or less at a tertiary-care, academic children's hospital who underwent tracheostomy placement between July 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010 for failure to extubate and chronic lung disease of prematurity. Last follow-up data reviewed was January 1, 2013. RESULTS: 43 patients were identified. 32 patients (74.4%) were able to be weaned from mechanical ventilation by the end of follow-up period, and the average time that elapsed between tracheostomy placement and weaning from mechanical ventilator support was 17.9 months. 19 patients (44.2%) were able to be decannulated, and of those patients, the amount of time between tracheostomy placement and decannulation was 27.9 months. No statistical significance was found in the relationship between tracheostomy timing placement and ability to wean from mechanical ventilator support or decannulate. For those patients able to wean from mechanical ventilator support and get decannulated, no difference in the amount of time and tracheostomy timing was found. Earlier premature patients tended to undergo tracheostomy later in life. CONCLUSIONS: Decisions regarding tracheostomy placement should be individualized. We were unable to detect a relationship between tracheostomy timing and the ability or duration for premature infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity to wean from mechanical ventilator support or successfully decannulate.", "BACKGROUND: Although inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy in term infants with pulmonary hypertension (PHT) has demonstrated definite benefit, the use of iNO in preterm infants remains inconclusive. AIMS: To evaluate the impact of iNO treatment in premature infants with acute PHT. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SUBJECTS: Infants\u202f<\u202f34\u202fweeks' gestational age, admitted during 2010-2016 to two neonatal units, having treated with iNO for confirmed PHT. A positive response was defined by FiO(2) reduction >/=20% within 3-h post iNO initiation. Early PHT was defined when developed within the first 72\u202fh of age. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the evaluation of the acute response to iNO administration. Secondary outcomes included the comparison of neonatal characteristics and outcomes between positive and negative responders, and early or late PHT infants. RESULTS: Of the 55 infants of our cohort, 39 (71%) had a positive response to iNO administration. No differences noted regarding bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage or other morbidities; however, positive responders had significantly higher survival rate in overall (77 vs 21%, p\u202f=\u202f0.001) and within early PHT subgroup (74 vs 33%, p\u202f=\u202f0.044). Regression analysis revealed that oligohydramnios (OR 2.834, 95%CI 1.652-6.070) and early PHT (OR 1.953, 95%CI 1.377-2.930) were significantly related with a positive response. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants with confirmed acute PHT respond in significant proportion to the iNO administration, especially in the background of oligohydramnios or the development of early PHT.", "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disorder common among very preterm infants affecting significantly not only mortality and morbidity but also neurodevelopmental outcomes. This review aims to identify the short and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants with BPD, considering that the new definition of BPD allows to relate severity of BPD with greater risk of developmental delay."]}
{"question": "Clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome in febrile patients with sickle cell disease: is it accurate enough?", "retrieved_passages": ["STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of empiric chest radiography (CXR) is of significant value in detecting clinically unsuspected acute chest syndrome (ACS) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: Patients with SCD presenting to the emergency department and hematology clinic with temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees C were prospectively evaluated using a physician-completed questionnaire. The questionnaire included inquiries into the patient's physical signs and symptoms and the physician's clinical impression for the presence of ACS. The questionnaire was completed before obtaining CXR results in all patients. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients with SCD with 96 febrile events were evaluated over a 1-year period. Twenty-four percent (23/96) of the patients had CXR evidence of ACS. On the basis of the questionnaire data, 61% (14/23) of ACS cases were not clinically suspected by the evaluating physician before obtaining CXR. Comparing the patients with and without ACS revealed that, with the exception of splinting (4/23 [17%] versus 0/73 [0%]), no symptom or physical examination finding helped to identify which patients had ACS. Fifty-seven percent of patients with ACS had completely normal findings on physical examination. The presentation of patients with clinically detected versus clinically unsuspected ACS also did not differ significantly. Length of hospitalization, oxygen use, and need for transfusion were the same in both the unsuspected and detected ACS groups. Overall physician sensitivity for predicting ACS was only 39%, and diagnostic accuracy did not improve significantly with increasing levels of pediatric training. CONCLUSION: ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD."]}
{"question": "Outcome Feedback within Emergency Medicine Training Programs: An Opportunity to Apply the Theory of Deliberate Practice?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: Outcome feedback is the process of learning patient outcomes after their care within the emergency department. We conducted a national survey of Canadian Royal College emergency medicine (EM) residents and program directors to determine the extent to which active outcome feedback and follow-up occurred. We also compared the perceived educational value of outcome feedback between residents and program directors. METHODS: We distributed surveys to all Royal College-accredited adult and pediatric EM training programs using a modified Dillman method. We analyzed the data using student's t-test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. RESULTS: We received 210 completed surveys from 260 eligible residents (80.8%) and 21 of 24 program directors (87.5%) (overall 81.3%). Mandatory active outcome feedback was not present in any EM training program for admitted or discharged patients (0/21). Follow-up was performed electively by 89.4% of residents for patients admitted to the hospital, and by 44.2% of residents for patients discharged home. A majority of residents (76.9%) believed that patient follow-up should be mandatory compared to 42.9% of program directors (p=0.002). The perceived educational value of outcome feedback was 5.8/7 for residents and 5.1/7 for program directors (difference 0.7; p=0.002) based on a seven-point Likert scale (1=not important; 7=very important). CONCLUSION: While Canadian EM training programs do not mandate follow-up, it is performed electively by the majority of residents surveyed. Residents place a significantly greater educational value on outcome feedback than their program directors, and believe that follow-up should be a mandatory component of EM residencies."]}
{"question": "Does a special interest in laparoscopy affect the treatment of acute cholecystitis?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that the treatment of patients with acute cholecystitis (AC) would be improved under the care of laparoscopic specialists. METHODS: The records of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for AC from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1998 were reviewed retrospectively. Of 170 patients, 48 were cared for by three laparoscopic specialists (LS group), whereas 122 were treated by nine general surgeons who perform only laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) (GS group). The rates of successful LC, complications, and length of hospital stay were compared. Multivariate analysis was used to control for baseline differences. RESULTS: The patients in the GS group were older (median age, 63 vs 53 years; p = 0.01). In all, 31 LS patients (65%), as compared with 44 GS patients (36%), had successful laparoscopic treatment (p = 0.001). The operating time was the same (median, 70 min). The proportion of patients with postoperative complications was similar in the two groups (37% in the GS vs 31% in the LS group; p = 0.6). The median postoperative hospital stay (3 vs 5 days; p <0.01) was shorter in the LS group. On logistic regression analysis, significant predictors of a successful laparoscopic operation included LS group (p <0.01) and age (p = 0). Predictors of prolonged length of hospital stay were age (p <0.01) and comorbidity score (p <0.01), with LS group status not a significant factor (p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AC are more likely to undergo successful LC if cared for by a surgeon with an interest in laparoscopy. However, length of hospital stay is influenced more by patient factors in a multivariate model.", "BACKGROUNDS/AIMS: Acute cholecystitis is a rare condition in pregnant women, potentially affecting the maternal and fetal prognosis. Our aim was to report the main clinical and paraclinical features of acute cholecystitis during pregnancy and therapeutic modalities. METHODS: We conducted a case series analysis recording pregnant patients with acute cholecystitis admitted to our surgery department over a period of 11 years. We collected clinical data, paraclinical features, and management modalities related to cholecystitis. RESULTS: There were 47 patients. Twenty-eight percent was in the first trimester of pregnancy, 40% in the second, and 32% in the third trimester. Abdominal pain was located in the right hypochondrium in 75% of cases. Fever was noted in 21% of cases. C-reactive protein was elevated in 39% of patients. Cholestasis markers were high in four patients. Abdominal ultrasound showed a distended gallbladder in 39 patients, with thickened wall in 34 patients, and gallbladder lithiasis in all cases. No patient had a dilated main bile duct. All patients received intravenous antibiotic therapy. Tocolysis was indicated in 32 patients. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 32 cases (68%), and open cholecystectomy in 15 cases (32%). Postoperative course was uneventful in 42 patients, and complicated in 5 patients. Rate of complications was statistically higher after open cholecystectomy (p = 0.003). Morbidity rate was higher in the third trimester (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Delay in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis during pregnancy can lead to serious complications. Management is based on antibiotic therapy and cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to be less morbid than open cholecystectomy.", "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a standard treatment for patients with gallstones in the gallbladder. However, multiple risk factors affect the probability of conversion from laparoscopic cholecystectomy to open surgery. A greater understanding of the preoperative factors related to conversion is crucial to improve patient safety. In the present systematic review, we summarized the current knowledge about the main factors associated with conversion. Next, we carried out several meta-analyses to evaluate the impact of independent clinical risk factors on conversion rate. Male gender (OR = 1.907; 95%CI = 1.254-2.901), age > 60 years (OR = 4.324; 95%CI = 3.396-5.506), acute cholecystitis (OR = 5.475; 95%CI = 2.959-10.130), diabetes (OR = 2.576; 95%CI = 1.687-3.934), hypertension (OR = 1.931; 95%CI = 1.018-3.662), heart diseases (OR = 2.947; 95%CI = 1.047-8.296), obesity (OR = 2.228; 95%CI = 1.162-4.271), and previous upper abdominal surgery (OR = 3.301; 95%CI = 1.965-5.543) increased the probability of conversion. Our analysis of clinical factors suggested the presence of different preoperative conditions, which are non-modifiable but could be useful for planning the surgical scenario and improving the post-operatory phase.", "Bile is aseptic; under conditions of no external influx, there is a less than 30% chance of isolating bacteria even in acute cholecystitis. This study was conducted to evaluate the incidence of biliary microflora and most common biliary microflora and resistance to antibiotics in patients with cholecystitis, as well as predict situations that do not require the use of prophylactic antibiotics.Bile samples were collected for culture using standard methods during all cholecystectomies performed from January 2015 to December 2015 in the Department of Surgery, Pusan National University Hospital. A total of 366 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed during the study period. In 215 patients, bile culture was performed and cultures were positive in 54 cases. Prophylactic antibiotics with 2nd-generation cephalosporin were administered once 30 minutes before surgery. According to the results of bile culture, patients were divided into 2 groups, culture-negative and culture-positive groups. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors were compared between groups.The culture positive group was older (P = .000). The number of patients with performance of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), performance of percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD), presence of symptoms, presence of operative complications, and hospital stay was significantly higher in the culture-positive group than in culture-negative group. In multivariate analysis of factors associated with positive culture, age, ERCP, and symptoms were independent factors affecting positive bile culture. Eighty-five bacteria were identified in 54 patients. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella were common in gram-negative bacteria. Enterococcus was the most common in gram-positive bacteria. Less than 5% resistance was observed against carbapenem, beta-lactam antibiotics, glycopeptide antibiotics, and linezolid.The bile of patients with laparoscopic cholecystectomy may contain microorganisms, particularly elderly patients, those with symptoms, and those who undergo preoperative ERCP. When ERCP was performed, multiple bacteria culture-positive results were more likely to be found. Although carbapenem, beta-lactam antibiotics, glycopeptide antibiotics, and linezolid may be suitable prophylactic antibiotics, additional studies of the clinical aspects of culture-positive bile is needed to determine the importance of bacterial growth in bile.", "BACKGROUND: With medical advancement, common bile duct stones were treated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), considered the standard treatment. However, ERCP might induce complications including pancreatitis and cholecystitis that could affect a subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), leading to conversion to open cholecystectomy perioperative complications. It is not yet known whether or not the time interval between ERCP and LC plays a role in increasing conversion rate and complications. Bides, in the traditional sense, after ERCP, for avoiding edema performing LC was several weeks later. Even no one study could definite whether early laparoscopic cholecystectomy after ERCP affected the prognosis or not clearly. OBJECTIVE: Comparing some different surgical timings of LC after ERCP. METHOD: Searching databases consist of all kinds of searching tools, such as Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, etc. All the included studies should meet the demands of this meta-analysis. In all interest outcomes below, we took full advantage of RevMan5 and WinBUGS to assess; the main measure was odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence. Moreover, considering the inconsistency of the specific time points in different studies, we set a subgroup to analyze the timing of LC after ERCP. For this part, Bayesian network meta-analysis was done with WinBUGS. RESULT: In the pool of conversion rate, the result suggested that the early LC group was equal compared with late LC (OR = 0.68, I2 = 0%, P = .23). Besides, regarding morbidity, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (OR = 0.74, I2 = 0%, P = .26). However, early LC, especially for laparoscopic-endoscopic rendezvous that belonged to performing LC within 24 hours could reduce the post-ERCP pancreatitis (OR = 0.16, I2 = 29%, P = .0003). Considering early LC included a wide time and was not precise enough, we set a subgroup by Bayesian network, and the result suggested that performing LC during 24 to 72 hours was the lowest conversion rate (rank 1: 0%). CONCLUSION: In the present study, LC within 24 to 72 hours conferred advantages in terms of the conversion rate, with no recurrence of acute cholecystitis episodes."]}
{"question": "Can progression of valvar aortic stenosis be predicted accurately?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: It was the aim of the present study to elaborate criteria for the assessment of rapid hemodynamic progression of valvar aortic stenosis. These criteria are of special importance when cardiac surgery is indicated for other reasons but the established criteria for aortic valve replacement are not yet fulfilled. Such aspects of therapeutic planing were mostly disregarded in the past so that patients had to undergo cardiac reoperation within a few years. METHODS: Hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and clinical data of 169 men and 88 women with aortic stenosis, aged 55.2 +/- 15.7 years at their first and 63.4 +/- 15.6 years at their second cardiac catheterization, were analyzed. RESULTS: The progression rate of aortic valve obstruction was found to be dependent on the degree of valvar calcification ([VC] scoring 0 to III) and to be exponentially correlated with the aortic valve opening area (AVA) at initial catheterization. Neither age nor sex of the patient nor etiology of the valvar obstruction significantly influence the progression of aortic stenosis. If AVA decreases below 0.75 cm(2) with a present degree of VC = 0, or AVA of 0.8 with VC of I, AVA of 0.9 with VC of II, or AVA of 1.0 with VC of III, it is probable that aortic stenosis will have to be operated upon in the following years. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that for clinical purposes and planning of valvar surgery the progression of asymptomatic aortic stenosis can be sufficiently predicted by the present aortic valve opening area and the degree of valvar calcification."]}
{"question": "Is determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury clinically relevant?", "retrieved_passages": ["STUDY DESIGN: This study is a prospective clinical study. PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the characteristics of trunk musculature and intervertebral discs by using magnetic resonance imaging in patients with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) with thoracic and lumbar fractures. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Muscle atrophy is an immediate consequence of SCI and is associated with secondary complications. At present, there are limited clinical data on muscle and disc responses to fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. METHODS: A total of 51 patients with a mean age of 31.75+/-10.42 years who suffered traumatic SCI were included in this study. Complete neurological examinations (American Spinal Injury Association grading) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at the time of admission and at 3-6 months after injury to study the neurological status and disc and trunk parameters. The type of management (operative or conservative) was decided on the basis of clinical, radiological, and MRI evaluations, and a robust rehabilitation program was initiated. RESULTS: Disc parameters including disc angle, skin angle, cross-sectional area (CSA), and disc height and trunk parameters (mean trunk width, mean trunk depth, and CSA of the lumbar muscles) decreased significantly (p <0.001) during the first 3 months after SCI. However, improvements were observed in disc and muscle parameters at the 6-month follow-up, but these parameters did not return to normal levels. Neither initial neurological status (complete vs. incomplete) nor type of management (operative vs. conservative) had a significant effect on these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal trauma leads to alterations in the morphology of the vertebral column, spinal cord, intervertebral discs, and paraspinal muscles in the initial phase of injury. The extent of these changes may determine the initial neurological deficit and subsequent recovery. Although this study did not identify any statistically significant effect of neurological status or management strategy on these parameters, rehabilitation was found to result in the improvement of these parameters in the later phase of recovery. Future studies are required to evaluate the exact causes of these alterations and the potential benefits of rehabilitation strategies and to minimize these changes.", "STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multicenter longitudinal cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To validate the prognostic value of the acute phase sacral sparing measurements with regard to chronic phase-independent ambulation in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: European Multicenter Study of Human Spinal Cord Injury (EM-SCI). METHODS: In 432 patients, acute phase (0-15 days) American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)/International Spinal Cord Society neurological standard scale (AIS) grades, ASIA sacral sparing measurements, which are S4-5 light touch (LT), S4-5 pin prick (PP), anal sensation and voluntary anal contraction; and chronic phase (6 or 12 months) indoor mobility Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) measurements were analyzed. Calculations of positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) as well as univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed in all four sacral sparing criteria. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) ratios of all regression equations was calculated. RESULTS: To achieve independent ambulation 1-year post injury, a normal S4-5 PP score showed the best PPV (96.5%, P<0.001, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 87.9-99.6). Best NPV was reported in the S4-5 LT score (91.7%, P<0.001, 95% CI: 81.6-97.2). The use of the combination of only voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP sensory scores (AUC: 0.906, P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.871-0.941) showed significantly better (P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.038-0.128) discriminating results in prognosticating 1-year independent ambulation than with the use of currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI (AUC: 0.823, P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.781-0.864). CONCLUSIONS: Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.

OBJECTIVES: Assess the relationship between Magnetic Resonance (MR) image patterns and neurological recovery in patients with Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury (TSCI). SETTING: Spinal cord injury unit in Spain. METHODS: Patients admitted for acute TSCI between January 2010 and December 2018 with a MR exam performed in the acute phase were selected. Five patterns were established: normal, single-level edema, multilevel edema, hemorrhage, and spinal cord transection. Comparisons between the ASIA Injury Severity (AIS) score and Motor Index (MI) at admission and at discharge were made. RESULTS: Collected 296 patients. Normal and cord transection patterns were excluded due to the low number of cases. Single-level edema pattern was primarily observed in cases with incomplete injuries, hemorrhage pattern in complete injuries, and multilevel edema pattern at similar percentages in complete and incomplete lesions. Improvement of the AIS score was found in 40.9% of single-level edema, 20.2% of multilevel edema, and 19.0% of hemorrhage (p = 0.042) patterns. By excluding the AIS grade D from the analyses, the figures increased to 70.3%, 52.2%, and 19.4% respectively (p < 0.001). This significant relationship was confirmed by multivariate analysis, although it was not as relevant as the examination according to ASIA-ISCoS performed at admission (p = 0.005 vs p < 0.001). Mean variation of the MI was also significantly different (p < 0.001) between the three groups: 22.6 +/- 21.4 for single-level edema, 16.9 +/- 21.1 for multilevel edema, and 4.5 +/- 8.4 for hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: MR injury patterns observed at the acute phase are associated with the possibility of improvement of the AIS score and MI.", "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts the fine-balanced interaction between the CNS and immune system and can cause maladaptive aberrant immune responses. The study examines emerging autoantibody synthesis after SCI with binding to conformational spinal cord epitopes and surface peptides located on the intact neuronal membrane. METHODS: This is a prospective longitudinal cohort study conducted in acute care and inpatient rehabilitation centers in conjunction with a neuropathologic case-control study in archival tissue samples ranging from acute injury (baseline) to several months thereafter (follow-up). In the cohort study, serum autoantibody binding was examined in a blinded manner using tissue-based assays (TBAs) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neuronal cultures. Groups with traumatic motor complete SCI vs motor incomplete SCI vs isolated vertebral fracture without SCI (controls) were compared. In the neuropathologic study, B cell infiltration and antibody synthesis at the spinal lesion site were examined by comparing SCI with neuropathologically unaltered cord tissue. In addition, the CSF in an individual patient was explored. RESULTS: Emerging autoantibody binding in both TBA and DRG assessments was restricted to an SCI patient subpopulation only (16%, 9/55 sera) while being absent in vertebral fracture controls (0%, 0/19 sera). Autoantibody binding to the spinal cord characteristically detected the substantia gelatinosa, a less-myelinated region of high synaptic density involved in sensory-motor integration and pain processing. Autoantibody binding was most frequent after motor complete SCI (grade American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale A/B, 22%, 8/37 sera) and was associated with neuropathic pain medication. In conjunction, the neuropathologic study demonstrated lesional spinal infiltration of B cells (CD20, CD79a) in 27% (6/22) of patients with SCI, the presence of plasma cells (CD138) in 9% (2/22). IgG and IgM antibody syntheses colocalized to areas of activated complement (C9neo) deposition. Longitudinal CSF analysis of an additional single patient demonstrated de novo (IgM) intrathecal antibody synthesis emerging with late reopening of the blood-spinal cord barrier. DISCUSSION: This study provides immunologic, neurobiological, and neuropathologic proof-of-principle for an antibody-mediated autoimmunity response emerging approximately 3 weeks after SCI in a patient subpopulation with a high demand of neuropathic pain medication. Emerging autoimmunity directed against specific spinal cord and neuronal epitopes suggests the existence of paratraumatic CNS autoimmune syndromes.", "AIMS OF THE STUDY: Examinations and assessments can be used to ensure good quality rehabilitation. Within the framework of a quality improvement project, the aims of the current analysis were: first, to analyse the time points of selected examinations and assessments in the rehabilitation process of patients with a newly acquired spinal cord injury. Second, to identify differences between the subgroups with different aetiologies, levels and completeness of spinal cord injuries. And third, to compare the examinations and assessments performed with the guideline recommendations and to use discrepancies as a starting point for a quality improvement project. METHODS: In this retrospective chart analysis, adult patients with a newly acquired spinal cord injury who were admitted to a single specialised acute care and rehabilitation clinic for their first rehabilitation between December 2013 and December 2014 were included and assessed until discharge. The main objective was to assess the time to examinations or assessments after injury or hospital admission in comparison to the respective recommendations. Analyses were done using time-to-event analysis and represented graphically using Kaplan-Meier plots. RESULTS: Of the 105 patients included in this study (median age 58 years, 29% female), 61% had a traumatic and 39% a non-traumatic spinal cord injury; 39% were paraplegic and 61% were quadriplegic; and 59% had a motor complete and 41% a sensor-motor incomplete spinal cord injury. The percentage of patients for whom the respective assessment or examination was performed and the percentage of these patients for whom it performed within the recommended time were: 90% and 71% for magnetic resonance imaging; 85% and 90% for computed tomography; 87% and 79% for the manual muscle test; 95% and 59% for the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord (ISNCSCI); 84% and 50% for electrophysiological assessment; 73% and 90% for urodynamic testing; and 49% and 53% for lung function testing. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a relevant gap between recommendations and clinical routine for time to some assessments after spinal cord injury. Within the framework of a quality improvement project, the next steps should be to build a national and international consensus on specific time frames for examinations and assessments in patients with a newly acquired spinal cord injury and thereafter, to develop an institutional implementation strategy. &nbsp; &nbsp."]}
{"question": "Improvements in survival of gynaecological cancer in the Anglia region of England: are these an effect of centralisation of care and use of multidisciplinary management?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Our hypothesis is that the adoption of Department of Health (DH) guidance has led to an improvement in outcome in gynaecological cancer survival. SETTING: In 1999 the DH in England introduced the Improving Outcomes in Gynaecological Cancer guidance, advising case management by multidisciplinary teams with surgical concentration in specialist hospitals. This guidance was rapidly adopted in the East of England, with a population of 2.5 million. POPULATION: The population of the Anglia Cancer Network was approximately 2.3 million. METHODS: From 1996 to 2003, details of 3406 cases of gynaecological cancer were identified in the Anglia region of England. Survival analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazards regression, relative to cases diagnosed in 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary endpoint was survival. RESULTS: The survival rates for cases diagnosed between 1996 and 1999 were broadly the same across the time period, with a marked improvement taking place in 2000, and continuing to 2003 (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.79, comparing 2000-03 with 1996-99 diagnoses), for all gynaecological sites combined. Adjustment for treatments or method of case follow-up did not attenuate these improvements. There was a concurrent change towards major surgery being performed in specialist centres from 2000. CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of the 1999 guidance on gynaecological cancer, which included multidisciplinary case management and centralisation of surgery, resulted in a marked step-change improvement in survival of gynaecological cancer in an area of eastern England in 2000."]}
{"question": "Is vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency related to the development of osteochondritis dissecans?", "retrieved_passages": ["Vitamin D deficiency occurs frequently in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Vitamin D is important for optimal mineralization of bone and may be important for other comorbidities commonly occurring in patients with CF. Vitamin D deficiency in patients with CF can arise from various causes including pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, lack of outdoor activity, and alterations of vitamin D metabolism. Due to fat malabsorption stemming from pancreatic insufficiency, higher oral doses of vitamin D are necessary to correct and maintain optimal vitamin D status in patients with CF. Recent studies have demonstrated that higher vitamin D status is associated with better lung function and that vitamin D therapy may help recovery from pulmonary exacerbations of CF. The mechanisms by which vitamin D may exert its beneficial actions in CF are unclear but likely related to the role vitamin D has in modulating the adaptive and innate immune response. Large randomized clinical studies to evaluate the potential role of vitamin D as adjunctive therapy in CF that goes beyond bone are necessary.", "Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is highly prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aims to determine the relationship between vitamin D and frequency of vascular access dysfunction (VAD) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We reviewed medical records of all HD patients who had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels at 4 outpatient dialysis facilities between January 2011 and January 2012. Patients were included if they were >/=18 years of age, had been on maintenance dialysis for >/=3 months, and had native arteriovenous fistula or synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for dialysis access. Patients with catheters were excluded. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels <30 ng/mL were documented in 183 patients (86%). Median and interquartile range [Q1, Q3] of 25OHD level was 16 [11, 25] ng/mL. Among 213 dialysis patients, 102 had VAD. Median 25OHD level was significantly lower in patients who had VAD than in those without VAD (14.5 [10, 22] vs. 19 [12, 27.5] ng/mL; P = 0.003). There was significant association between VAD and the lowest quartile relative to the highest quartile of 25OHD level. A 25OHD level <12 ng/mL was associated with more than doubling of risk for VAD (OR 2.56; 95% CI [1.05-6.23], P < 0.05). Of 213 patients, 140 were treated with ergocalciferol and 73 were not treated. Treatment was associated with significant reduction in VAD (OR = 0.36; 95% CI [0.19-0.68], P = 0.002). Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is an independent risk factor for VAD in HD patients; its treatment with ergocalciferol is associated with decreased VAD.", "OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D affects multiple body functions through the regulation of gene expression. In sports medicine, its influence on musculoskeletal health and performance is of particular interest. Vitamin D insufficiency might decrease athletic performance and increase the risk of musculoskeletal injuries. Several studies have demonstrated vitamin D deficiency in professional athletes; however, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in professional handball players is yet unknown. METHODS: The study was planned as a prospective, non-interventional study. We examined 70 male elite handball athletes (first league) in a pre-competition medical assessment in July. Age, height, weight, body mass index, 25-OH vitamin D, calcium, and parathyroid hormone were evaluated, and a sun exposure score was calculated. Players were then divided into two groups of vitamin D levels: insufficient (<30 ng/mL) and sufficient (>/=30 ng/mL). RESULTS: The mean 25-OH vitamin D level of the 70 players was 33.5 +/- 10.9 ng/mL (median 32.2, IQR 26.5-38.9 ng/mL). Thirty-nine (55.7%) had sufficient and 31 (44.3%) insufficient levels. Athletes with sufficient vitamin D levels had significantly lower parathyroid hormone levels than athletes with insufficiency (24.9 +/- 12.1 vs. 33.5 +/- 15.1 ng/mL, p = 0.02). All other parameters evaluated demonstrated no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D insufficiency is a common finding in professional handball athletes even in summer, which might negatively affect physical performance. Furthermore, it might lead to an increased risk of musculoskeletal injuries and infections. This should be evaluated in further studies.", "Vitamin D is known for its role in calcium homeostasis for optimal skeletal health. It was previously believed that only elderly or hospitalized patients were at risk for vitamin D insufficiency, but many people in the general US population have insufficient levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D). According to the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 61% of white and 91% of black Americans suffer from vitamin D insufficiency (25D < 32 ng/mL). Recent studies have demonstrated that a minimum 25(OH)D level of 32 ng/mL is necessary for optimal protection from fracture and intestinal absorption of calcium. Recently, vitamin D has been recognized as important for extraskeletal functions such as immune function, cancer prevention, and hypertension prevention. We review the role of vitamin D in skeletal health and present data on vitamin D in other extraskeletal diseases, with special emphasis on the rheumatology patient.", "BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests a relationship between vitamin D (VD) insufficiency and cardiovascular disease. AIM: We aimed to investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH VD) with coronary tortuosity (CT) in patients with normal or near-normal (< 40% stenosis) coronary arteries. METHODS: The present study was cross-sectional and observational. We enrolled 356 consecutive patients who had undergone coronary angiography for suspected ischaemic heart disease and were found to have normal or near-normal coronary arteries. Patients were categorised as VD insufficient (< 30 ng/mL) or VD sufficient (>/= 30 ng/dL). CT was defined as the presence of >/= three bends (defined as >/= 45 degrees  change in vessel direction) along the main trunk of at least one coronary artery, present both in systole and in diastole. RESULTS: The study populations were divided into two groups according to the presence of CT: patients with CT (n = 103, 29%) and patients without CT (NCT; n = 253, 71%). CT is more frequently seen in elderly women and is positively correlated with hypertension. The incidence of VD insufficiency was significantly higher in the CT group (n = 46, 45%) than in the NCT group (n = 90, 36%; p = 0.005). In further multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjustment for major clinical parameters affecting CT showed statistically significant correlations between 25-OH VD and CT (odds ratio = 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.98, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D insufficiency was independently associated with coronary tortuosity."]}
{"question": "Histologic evaluation of the testicular remnant associated with the vanishing testes syndrome: is surgical management necessary?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: There is controversy surrounding the optimal management of the testicular remnant associated with the vanishing testes syndrome. Some urologists advocate the need for surgical exploration, whereas others believe this is unnecessary. These differing opinions are based on the variable reports of viable germ cell elements found within the testicular remnants. To better understand the pathology associated with this syndrome and the need for surgical management, we reviewed our experience regarding the incidence of viable germ cell elements within the testicular remnant. METHODS: An institutional review board-approved, retrospective review was performed of all consecutive patients undergoing exploration for a nonpalpable testis at Eastern Virginia Medical School and Geisinger Medical Center between 1994 and 2006. Patients who were found to have spermatic vessels and a vas deferens exiting a closed internal inguinal ring were included in this analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients underwent removal of the testicular remnant. Patient age ranged from 11 to 216 months. In 8 of the specimens (14%), we identified viable germ cell elements. In an additional 4 patients (7%), we identified seminiferous tubules without germ cell elements. CONCLUSIONS: In our review, we identified that a significant number of testicular remnants associated with the vanishing testes syndrome can harbor viable germ cell elements or seminiferous tubules. The exact fate of these residual elements remains unknown; however, there may exist the potential for malignant transformation. Given the potential for malignant degeneration, we believe that these remnants should be removed."]}
{"question": "Does pain intensity predict a poor opioid response in cancer patients?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that initial pain intensity is not a predictive factor of poor opioid response in advanced cancer patients, as suggested by a recent work. METHODS: A secondary analysis of one-hundred-sixty-seven patients referred for treatment of cancer-related pain was conducted. Pain intensity at admission was recorded and patients were divided in three categories of pain intensity: mild, moderate and severe. Patients were offered a treatment with opioid dose titration, according to department policy. Data regarding opioid doses and pain intensity were collected after dose titration was completed. Four levels of opioid response were considered: (a) good pain control, with minimal opioid escalation and without relevant adverse effects; (b) good pain control requiring more aggressive opioid escalation, for example doubling the doses in four days; (c) adequate pain control associated with the occurrence of adverse effects; (d) poor pain control with adverse effects. RESULTS: Seventy-six, forty-four, forty-one and six patients showed a response a, b, c, and d, respectively. No correlation between baseline pain intensity categories and opioid response was found. Patients with response 'b' and 'd' showed higher values of OEImg. CONCLUSION: Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "BACKGROUND: Pain is one of the most common symptoms in patients suffering from advanced cancer and receiving palliative care and is often responsible for a poor quality of life. To date, there exists no published correlation between biological, measurable biomarkers and pain intensity. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to search and identify pain-associated cytokines (biomarkers) correlating with changes in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores in patients with cancer before and after pain treatment. The secondary objectives were to assess cytokine serum level differences between patients and healthy controls and to evaluate possible relationships between pain entities, pain intensity (in NRS), gender, location of primary tumor, and the patients' cytokine baseline concentrations. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled, prospective study. SETTING: University medical center. METHODS: Eligible patients with exacerbated cancer-related pain (NRS = 5) and healthy controls with no pain were included. Serum level changes of 19 cytokines were analyzed before and during opioid treatment. RESULTS: Of 19 analyzed biomarkers, 5 (IL-7, IL-18, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and OPG) turned out to correlate significantly with pain relief. In healthy controls, all analyzed cytokines showed no significant differences. In the secondary analysis, only one significant correlation was detected between OPG and pain entities. Furthermore, IL-4, IL-7, IFN-gamma and OPG appeared to account for the ability to predict a patient's gender. LIMITATIONS: Our findings should be considered as preliminary and need to be confirmed in further studies. CONCLUSION: Our results provide preliminary evidence of a significant correlation of pain relief in patients with cancer and at least 5 cytokines. These biomarkers may serve as the basis for development of diagnostic tools for pain assessment and could serve as potential new targets for pain control.", "OBJECTIVES: One of the most challenging areas of emergency medicine practice is the management and treatment of severe and persistent pain, including cancer-related pain. Emergency departments (EDs) in the United States frequently provide care for patients with cancer and an increasing concern is the potential for opioid misuse in this patient group. The authors determined the risk for opioid misuse among ED cancer patients with pain and assessed demographic and clinical factors associated with increased misuse risk. The Texas state prescription monitoring program was also queried for evidence of multiple opioid prescriptions for comparing low- and high-risk groups. METHODS: The Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain-Revised (SOAPP-R) was administered to assess risk for opioid misuse among cancer patients presenting to the ED of a comprehensive cancer center in the United States. Eligibility criteria included: 1) presentation for treatment of chronic cancer-related pain while taking a prescribed schedule II opioid for analgesia, 2) age of 18 years or older, 3) ability to speak English, and 4) ability to understand the study and give written informed consent. RESULTS: Of 934 ED patients screened for the study, 290 were eligible and 209 participated (72% response rate). On the basis of the recommended SOAPP-R cutoff score of 18, a total of 71 of the 209 patients (34%) were categorized as having a high risk of misuse. Of note, 15% and 4% of all patients reported past or current use of illicit substances, respectively. The total number of annual opioid prescriptions (17.8 vs. 12.6; p = 0.023) differed between the high- versus low-risk groups. Multivariable analyses showed that depression (odds ratio [OR] = 3.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45 to 6.48; p = 0.003), poor coping (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.13; p = 0.001), and illicit substance use (OR = 28.30, 95% CI = 2.97 to 269.24; p = 0.029) were significantly associated with high risk of opioid misuse. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of opioid misuse among cancer patients is substantial. Screening for opioid misuse in the ED is feasible.", "The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the frequency, indications, outcomes, and predictive factors associated with opioid switching, using a protocol that had been clinically applied and viewed as effective for many years. A prospective study was carried out on a cohort of consecutive cancer patients who were receiving opioids but had an unacceptable balance between analgesia and adverse effects, despite symptomatic treatment of side effects. The initial conversion ratio between opioids and routes was as follows (mg/day): oral morphine 100=intravenous morphine 33=transdermal fentanyl 1=intravenous fentanyl 1=oral methadone 20=intravenous methadone 16=oral oxycodone 70=transdermal buprenorphine 1.3. The switch was assisted by opioids used as needed, and doses were changed after the initial conversion according to clinical response in an acute care setting. Intensity of pain and symptoms associated with opioid therapy were recorded. A distress score (DS) was calculated as a sum of symptom intensity. A switch was considered successful when the intensity of pain and/or DS, or the principal symptom necessitating the switch, decreased to at least 33% of the value recorded before switching. One hundred eighteen patients underwent opioid substitutions. The indications for opioid switching were uncontrolled pain and adverse effects (50.8%), adverse effects (28.8%), uncontrolled pain (15.2%), and convenience (4.2%). Overall, 103 substitutions were successful. Ninety-six substitutions were successful after the first switching, and a further substitution was successful in seven patients who did not respond to the first switch. The mean time to achieve dose stabilization after switching was 3.2 days. The presence of both poor pain control and adverse effects was related to unsuccessful switching (P<0.004). No relationship was identified between unsuccessful switching and the opioid dose, opioid sequence, pain mechanism, or use of adjuvant medications. Opioid switching was an effective method to improve the balance between analgesia and adverse effects in more than 80% of cancer patients with a poor response to an opioid. The presence of both poor pain relief and adverse effects is a negative factor for switching prognosis, whereas renal failure is not.", "OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to examine affecting factors for conversion ratio and to predict adequate fentanyl dose for patients with cancer pain in opioid switching from oral oxycodone. METHODS: Patient characteristics, biochemical parameters, daily oxycodone dose, and reasons for opioid switching were retrospectively collected. The effect of variables on the conversion ratio was analyzed by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Regression analysis for the data from 122 patients suggested that the typical conversion ratio was 95:1; however, this ratio was significantly reduced in patients taking a daily oral morphine-equivalent dose of <45 mg/d and in patients with poor pain control to 52:1 and 64:1, respectively. CONCLUSION: We should carefully and rapidly control pain in opioid switching based on the adequate dose indicated in this study."]}
{"question": "Assessing Patient Reported Outcomes Measures via Phone Interviews Versus Patient Self-Survey in the Clinic: Are We Measuring the Same Thing?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Longitudinally following patients requires a full-time employee (FTE)-dependent data inflow infrastructure. There are efforts to capture patient-reported outcomes (PROs) by the use of non-FTE-dependent methodologies. In this study, we set out to assess the reliability of PRO data captured via FTE-dependent compared with non-FTE-dependent methodologies. METHODS: A total of 119 adult patients (65 men) who underwent 1-and 2-level lumbar fusions at Duke University Medical Center were enrolled in this prospective study. Enrollment criteria included available demographic, clinical, and PRO data. All patients completed 2 sets of questionnaires--the first a phone interviews and the second a self-survey. There was at least a 2-week period between the phone interviews and self-survey. Questionnaires included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the visual analog scale for back pain (VAS-BP), and the visual analog scale for leg pain (VAS-LP). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the reliability of baseline PRO data captured. RESULTS: A total of 39.49% of patients were smokers, 21.00% had diabetes, and 11.76% had coronary artery disease; 26.89% reported history of anxiety disorder, and 28.57% reported history of depression. A total of 97.47% of patients had a high-school diploma or General Education Development, and 49.57% attained a 4-year college degree or postgraduate degree. We observed a high correlation between baseline PRO data captured between FTE-dependent versus non-FTE dependent methodologies (ODI: r = -0.89, VAS-BP: r = 0.74, VAS-LP: r = 0.70). There was no difference in PROs of baseline pain and functional disability between FTE-dependent and non-FTE-dependent methodologies: baseline ODI (FTE-dependent: 47.73 +/- 16.77 [mean +/- SD] vs. non-FTE-dependent: 45.81 +/- 12.11, P = 0.39), VAS-LP (FTE-dependent: 6.13 +/- 2.78 vs. non-FTE-dependent: 6.46 +/- 2.79, P = 0.36) and VAS-BP (FTE-dependent: 6.33 +/- 2.90 vs. non-FTE-dependent: 6.53 +/- 2.48, P = 0.57).

{"question": "Marital status, living arrangement and mortality: does the association vary by gender?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Men appear to benefit more from being married than women with respect to mortality in middle age. However, there is some uncertainty about gender differences in mortality risks in older individuals, widowed, divorced and single individuals and about the impact of living arrangements. METHODS: Longitudinal data with 1990 census records being linked to mortality data up to 2005 were used (Swiss National Cohort). The sample comprised all residents over age 44 years in Switzerland (n=2,440,242). All-cause mortality HRs for marital status and living arrangements were estimated by Cox regression for men and women and different age groups with adjustment for education and socio-professional category. RESULTS: The benefit of being married was stronger for men than for women; however, mortality patterns were similar, with higher mortality in divorced and single individuals compared with widowed individuals (<80 years). After adjustment for living arrangements, the gender difference by marital status disappeared. Stratification by living arrangement revealed that mortality risks were highest for 45-64-year-old divorced (HR 1.72 (95% CI 1.67 to 1.76)) and single men (HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.71)) who lived alone. In women of the same age, the highest mortality risk was observed for those who were single and living with a partner (HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.82)). In older age groups, the impact of marital status decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of living arrangements is crucial for identifying and explaining gender differences in mortality risks by marital status. The impact of living alone and living with a partner seems to be different in men and women.", "This study aims to (1) examine the association of living arrangements and health among oldest-old Chinese, and (2) investigate gender differences in the association of living arrangements and health. Data were from the first two waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, which included 9093 Chinese averaging 92 years old. Living arrangements had six mutually exclusive categories: living alone, with spouse, with children, with spouse and children, with others and in institutions. Using multinomial logistic regression, we found that baseline living arrangements are significantly associated with mortality, activities of daily living (ADL) disability, and self-rated health at Wave 2, controlling for baseline health, sociodemographic characteristics and availability of children. Further, the linkages between living arrangements and mortality vary by gender. Among the different living arrangements, having a spouse in the household (either with a spouse only or with both a spouse and children) provides the best health protection. Living alone and living with children are associated with both health advantages and disadvantages. Institutional living lowers mortality risk for men but not women. Living with others provides the least health benefits. Our study has extended the research on living arrangements and health to a unique population-the oldest-old in China-and clarified the health advantages and disadvantages of different living arrangements. Future research should examine the mechanisms linking living arrangements and health, and the experience of institutional living for men and women in China.", "BACKGROUND: Previous cross-sectional studies suggest that negative health outcomes such as mortality, social isolation, loneliness, and depression among older adults living alone vary by sex and marital status, with men often worse off than women and unmarried people worse off than married people. However, limited evidence exists from longitudinal studies regarding whether positive health outcomes such as subjective well-being (SWB) also vary by sex and marital status. The focus by sex and marital status on the positive health outcomes and diverse profiles of older adults living alone is important for public health in the near future. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify changes in SWB over time and its associated factors by sex and marital status among older adults living alone in the community using a longitudinal study in a representative population. METHODS: This was a longitudinal study using data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study. This study is the first to reveal differences in SWB and related factors over 3 years among older adults living alone in the community (n = 8,579) who were stratified by sex and marital status (married men, non-married men, married women, and non-married women). RESULTS: Women moved to higher levels of SWB than did men, and married individuals moved to higher levels of SWB than did unmarried individuals. Independent functioning factors and interpersonal factors were significantly associated with SWB for married men and married women, but for unmarried women, the association by interpersonal factors was more pronounced, and for unmarried men, only limited emotional support and health promotion activities were significant among the interpersonal factors. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that among older adults living alone, changes in SWB over time and the independent functioning factors and interpersonal factors associated with this change varied by sex and marital status among older people living alone. These findings are useful for policy-making and guiding intervention activities to promote SWB in a society in which the environment for older adults living alone is changing dramatically.", "BACKGROUND: Comparative evidence regarding the effects of social relationships on mortality in Mediterranean communities will increase our knowledge of their strengths and the ways in which they influence longevity across cultures. Men and women may benefit differently from social relationships because of cultural differences in gender roles. Psychosocial mechanisms such as social support, which may explain the effects of social networks, may also vary by culture. METHODS: Detailed information on the social relationships of a representative sample of 1,174 community-dwelling older adults was collected in Leganes, a city in central Spain. Mortality over a 6-year follow-up period was ascertained. Information on socio-demographic, health and disability variables was also collected. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted separately for men and women and for the combined sample. RESULTS: Having a confidant was associated with a 25% (95% CI 5-40%) reduction in the mortality risk. The hazard ratio for lack of social participation was 1.5 (95% CI 1.3-1.7). Being engaged in meaningful roles protected against mortality, while receipt of emotional support did not affect survival. These results were comparable for men and women. Having contact with all family ties was associated with reduced mortality only in men. Structural aspects of social networks make a unique contribution to survival, independently of emotional support and the role played in the lives of significant others. CONCLUSION: In this elderly Southern European population, the beneficial effects of social networks, social participation, engagement in the life of significant others and having a confidant call for public policies that foster intergenerational and community exchanges.", "BACKGROUND: In the United States, an estimated 48 million individuals live without health insurance. The purpose of the current study was to explore the Variation in insurance status by patient demographics and tumor site among nonelderly adult patients with cancer. METHODS: A total of 688,794 patients aged 18 to 64 years who were diagnosed with one of the top 25 incident cancers (representing 95% of all cancer diagnoses) between 2007 and 2010 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were analyzed. Patient characteristics included age, race, sex, marital status, and rural or urban residence. County-level demographics included percent poverty level. Insurance status was defined as having non-Medicaid insurance, Medicaid coverage, or no insurance. RESULTS: On multivariate logistic regression analyses, younger age, male sex, nonwhite race, being unmarried, residence in counties with higher levels of poverty, and rural residence were associated with being uninsured versus having non-Medicaid insurance (all P <.001). The highest rates of non-Medicaid insurance were noted among patients with prostate cancer (92.3%), melanoma of the skin (92.5%), and thyroid cancer (89.5%), whereas the lowest rates of non-Medicaid insurance were observed among patients with cervical cancer (64.2%), liver cancer (67.9%), and stomach cancer (70.9%) (P <.001). Among uninsured individuals, the most prevalent cancers were lung cancer (14.9%), colorectal cancer (12.1%), and breast cancer (10.2%) (P <.001). Lung cancer caused the majority of cancer mortality in all insurance groups. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of insurance coverage vary greatly by demographics and by cancer type. The expansion of health insurance coverage would be expected to disproportionally benefit certain demographic populations and cancer types."]}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of fetal thrombocytopenia in pregnancies complicated by Kell alloimmunization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, fetal platelet counts were performed in 42 pregnancies with severe Kell alloimmunization prior to the first intrauterine blood transfusion. Platelet counts from 318 first intrauterine transfusions in RhD alloimmunized pregnancies were used as controls. RESULTS: Fetal thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150 x 10(9)/l) was found in 4/42 (10%) in the Kell group and in 84/318 (26%) in the RhD group. None of the fetuses in the Kell alloimmunized pregnancies, including 15 with severe hydrops, had a clinically significant thrombocytopenia defined as a platelet count < 50 x 10(9)/l. In the RhD alloimmunized pregnancies, 2/230 (1%) of the non-hydropic fetuses and 7/30 (23%) of the severely hydropic fetuses had a clinically significant thrombocytopenia.

{"question": "Can third trimester ultrasound predict the presentation of the first twin at delivery?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of early sonogram to predict the presentation of twin A at birth. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all twin pregnancies evaluated at our Fetal Evaluation Unit from 2007 to 2009. Sonogram records were reviewed for the presentation of twin A at seven gestational age intervals and inpatient medical records were reviewed for the presentation of twin A at delivery. The positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of presentation as determined by ultrasound, at each gestational age interval, for the same presentation at delivery were calculated. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-eight twin pregnancies met inclusion criteria. A total of 896 ultrasounds were reviewed. The positive predictive value of cephalic presentation of twin A as determined by ultrasound for the persistence of cephalic presentation at delivery reached 95% after 28 weeks gestation. The positive predictive value for noncephalic presentation as established by sonogram for noncephalic at delivery was >90% after 32 weeks gestation. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of the first twin at delivery can be determined by sonogram by the 32nd week of gestation in over 90% of twin pregnancies.", "OBJECTIVE: Correct labeling of twin fetuses is needed for consistency in assigning and interpreting longitudinal scan and prenatal screening/diagnostic results. The aim of this study was to describe a standard method of twin labeling in the first trimester of pregnancy and to assess the robustness of such a technique in predicting the presenting twin in subsequent scans and at delivery. METHODS: This was a retrospective first-trimester study of all twin pregnancies assessed by ultrasonography at our center between 2000 and 2010. The fetus contained in the gestational sac closer to the maternal cervix was designated as Twin 1 and the relative orientation of the fetuses to each other was then defined as either lateral (left/right) or vertical (top/bottom). In discordant-sex twins, their sex and presenting order on the final scan prior to delivery were documented and compared with the sex and birth order at delivery. RESULTS: A total of 416 twin pregnancies were seen during the study period. At the 11-14-week scan 90.9% of twins were in lateral orientation while the remainder were oriented vertically. None of the vertically oriented twin pairs but 32 (8.5%) of the laterally oriented twin pairs changed their presenting order between the first and the last ultrasound scan prior to delivery. There were 108 discordant-sex twins scanned in the third trimester, of which the birth order changed in 20.3% that were delivered by Cesarean section and in 5.9% of those delivered vaginally. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that antenatal labeling of twins according to laterality or vertical orientation is reliable. The technique ensures continuity of biometric assessment from serial scans at each visit, and as such should be adopted as the preferred method of twin labeling. Furthermore, the use of orientation for antenatal labeling of twins rather than assignment of a number based on proximity to the cervix, precludes any misconception regarding which twin will be born first and ensures that parents and pediatricians are aware of the significant likelihood of a peripartum switch."]}
{"question": "Totally implantable venous access device placement by interventional radiologists: are prophylactic antibiotics necessary?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To determine the rate of early infection for totally implantable venous access devices (TIVADs) placed without antibiotic prophylaxis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A list of patients who underwent TIVAD placement in 2009 was obtained from the patient archiving and communication system (PACS). This list was cross-referenced to all patients who underwent TIVAD removal from January 1, 2009, through January 30, 2010, to identify TIVADs that were removed within 30 days of placement. Retrospective chart review was performed to record patient demographics, including age, sex, cancer diagnosis, and indication for removal. Concurrent antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, and laboratory data before and within 30 days of placement were recorded. Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) were identified using U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. RESULTS: There were 1,183 ports placed and 13 removed. CLABSIs occurred in seven (0.6%) patients within 30 days of placement. At the time of TIVAD placement, 81 (7%) patients were receiving antibiotics incidental to the procedure. One patient who received an antibiotic the day of implantation developed a CLABSI. Chemotherapy was administered to 148 (13%) patients on the day of placement.

Our objective was to suggest trial conditions adapted from the NF EN 13727 standard, for the evaluation of antiseptics used in gynecology and dermatology. METHODS: Three antiseptic solutions were tested in vitro: a chlorhexidine-benzalkonium (CB) combination, a hexamidine-chlorhexidine-chlorocresol (HCC) combination, and povidone iodine (P). The adaptation of trial conditions to the standard involved choosing dilutions, solvent, and interfering substances. The activity of solutions was assessed on the recommended strains at concentrations of 97% (pure solution), 50%, and 10% (diluted solution), and 1%. A logarithmic reduction >/= 5 was expected after 60seconds of contact, to meet requirements of bactericidal activity. RESULTS: HCC did not present any bactericidal activity except on P. aeruginosa at a concentration of 97%. P was not bactericidal on E. hirae at any concentration and on S. aureus at 97%. CB had the most homogeneous bactericidal activity with a reduction>5 log on the 4 bacterial strains at concentrations of 97%, 50% and 10%. CONCLUSION: Adapting the NF EN 13727 standard allowed assessing the 3 tested solutions: only CB was bactericidal in dirty conditions. This study proved the possibility of validating antiseptic choice in vitro, in current practice conditions, for adjunctive treatment of skin and mucous membranes disorders, primarily of bacterial origin or with a potential of superinfection."]}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the calculator in predicting postoperative complications in patients undergoing common bile duct (CBD) exploration. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was completed for 305 patients that underwent open and laparoscopic CBD exploration at a single institution from 2010 to 2018. Patient demographics and preoperative risk factors were entered into the calculator, and the predicted complication risks were compared with observed complication rates. Brier score, C-statistic, and Hosmer-Lemeshow regression analysis were used to assess discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: The observed rate exceeded the predicted rate for any complication (35.1% vs. 21%), return to operating room (5.9% vs. 3.6%), death (3.3% vs. 1%), and sepsis (3% vs. 2.4%). The model performed best in predicting serious complication (Brier 0.087, C-statistic 0.818, Hosmer-Lemeshow 0.695), surgical site infection (Brier 0.068, C-statistic 0.670, Hosmer-Lemeshow 0.292), discharge to rehabilitation facility (Brier 0.041, C-statistic 0.907, Hosmer-Lemeshow 0.638), and death (Brier 0.028, C-statistic 0.898, Hosmer-Lemeshow 0.004). In multivariable analysis, there was no statistically significant predicted complication type that affected the type of surgery. CONCLUSION: The calculator was accurate in predicting serious complication, surgical site infection, discharge to rehabilitation facility, and death. However, the model displayed poor predictive ability in all other complications that were analyzed.", "The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) risk calculator has been used to assist surgeons in predicting the risk of postoperative complications. This study aims to determine if the risk calculator accurately predicts complications in acute care surgical patients undergoing laparotomy. A retrospective review was performed on all patients on the acute care surgery service at a tertiary hospital who underwent laparotomy between 2011 and 2012. The preoperative risk factors were used to calculate the estimated risks of postoperative complications in both the original ACS NSQIP calculator and updated calculator (June 2016). The predicted rate of complications was then compared with the actual rate of complications. Ninety-five patients were included. Both risk calculators accurately predicted the risk of pneumonia, cardiac complications, urinary tract infections, venous thromboembolism, renal failure, unplanned returns to operating room, discharge to nursing facility, and mortality. Both calculators underestimated serious complications (26% vs 39%), overall complications (32.4% vs 45.3%), surgical site infections (9.3% vs 20%), and length of stay (9.7 days versus 13.1 days). When patients with prolonged hospitalization were excluded, the updated calculator accurately predicted length of stay. The ACS NSQIP risk calculator underestimates the overall risk of complications, surgical infections, and length of stay. The updated calculator accurately predicts length of stay for patients <30 days. The acute care surgical population represents a high-risk population with an increased rate of complications. This should be taken into account when using the risk calculator to predict postoperative risk in this population.", "BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons NSQIP risk calculator was developed from multi-institutional clinical data to estimate preoperative risk. The impact of outliers has the potential to greatly affect predictions. Although the effect of outliers is minimized in large series, their impact on the individual provider or institution could be profound. No previous study has assessed the risk calculator for a single institution or provider, including outliers. Our goal was to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted outcomes at a single institution. STUDY DESIGN: Laparoscopic colectomies performed by two colorectal surgeons at a tertiary referral center were prospectively evaluated using the risk calculator. Predicted outcomes were compared with actual outcomes for length of stay (LOS), complications, return to the operating room, and death. Main outcomes measures were differences in actual vs predicted outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred and sixteen patients were included. Actual LOS was higher than predicted (mean +/- SD 4.22 +/- 5.49 days vs predicted 4.11 +/- 1.18 days; p = 0.0001). Four outliers with multiple complications had an LOS >3 SDs from the mean. After removing these, observed LOS was significantly shorter than predicted (adjusted LOS mean +/- SD 3.31 +/- 2.30 days vs predicted 4.05 +/- 1.14 days; p = 0.002). Occurrence of any complication was significantly lower than predicted (17.3% vs 19.4%; p = 0.05). Rates of major complications (13.2% vs 19.4%; p = 0.009) and surgical site infections (9.8% vs 11.8%; p = 0.006) were also significantly lower than predicted. There were no significant differences in death, urinary tract infection, renal failure, and reoperation rates. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk calculator was effective for evaluating average surgical-risk patients, it does not accurately predict outcomes in a small percentage of patients when one or more serious complications occur. Addition of surgeon- and patient-specific data via the American College of Surgeons case-logging system could better adjust for these areas.", "BACKGROUND: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a severe complication from the patient's perspective and an expensive one in a value-driven healthcare model. Risk stratification can help identify those patients who may have risk factors for complications that can be mitigated in advance of elective surgery. Although numerous surgical risk calculators have been created, their accuracy in predicting outcomes, specifically PJI, has not been tested. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) How accurate is the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) Surgical Site Infection Calculator in predicting 30-day postoperative infection? (2) How accurate is the calculator in predicting 90-day postoperative infection? METHODS: We isolated 1536 patients who underwent 1620 primary THAs and TKAs at our institution during 2011 to 2013. Minimum followup was 90 days. The ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator was assessed in its ability to predict acute PJI within 30 and 90 days postoperatively. Patients who underwent a repeat surgical procedure within 90 days of the index arthroplasty and in whom at least one positive intraoperative culture was obtained at time of reoperation were considered to have PJI. A total of 19 cases of PJI were identified, including 11 at 30 days and an additional eight instances by 90 days postoperatively. Patient-specific risk probabilities for PJI based on demographics and comorbidities were recorded from the ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator website. The area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was calculated to determine the predictability of the risk probability for PJI. The AUC is an effective method for quantifying the discriminatory capacity of a diagnostic test to correctly classify patients with and without infection in which it is defined as excellent (AUC 0.9-1), good (AUC 0.8-0.89), fair (AUC 0.7-0.79), poor (AUC 0.6-0.69), or fail/no discriminatory capacity (AUC 0.5-0.59). A p value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: The ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator showed only fair accuracy in predicting 30-day PJI (AUC: 74.3% [confidence interval CI, 59.6%-89.0%]. For 90-day PJI, the risk calculator was also only fair in accuracy (AUC: 71.3% [CI, 59.9%-82.6%]). Conclusions The ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator is a fair predictor of acute PJI at the 30- and 90-day intervals after primary THA and TKA. Practitioners should exercise caution in using this tool as a predictive aid for PJI, because it demonstrates only fair value in this application. Existing predictive tools for PJI could potentially be made more robust by incorporating preoperative risk factors and including operative and early postoperative variables. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, diagnostic study.", "STUDY DESIGN: Clinical case series. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) surgical risk calculator in the prediction of complications after anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Identifying at-risk patients may aid in the prevention of complications after spine procedures. The ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator was developed to predict 30-day postoperative complications for a variety of operative procedures. METHODS: Medical records of patients undergoing ALIF at our institution from 2009 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and comorbidity variables were entered into the ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator to generate percentage predictions for complication incidence within 30 days postoperatively. The observed incidences of these complications were also abstracted from the medical record. The predictive ability of the ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator was assessed in comparison to the observed incidence of complications using area under the curve (AUC) analyses. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-three (253) patients were analyzed. The ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator was a fair predictor of discharge to non-home facility (AUC 0.71) and surgical site infection (AUC 0.70). The ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator was a good predictor of acute kidney injury/progressive renal insufficiency (AUC 0.81). The ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator was not an adequate predictive tool for any other category, including: pneumonia, urinary tract infections, venous thromboembolism, readmission, reoperations, and aggregate complications (AUC < 0.70). CONCLUSION: The ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator is an adequate predictive tool for a subset of complications after ALIF including acute kidney injury/progressive renal insufficiency, surgical site infections, and discharge to non-home facilities. However, it is a poor predictor for all other complication groups. The reliability of the ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator is limited, and further identification of models for risk stratification is necessary for patients undergoing ALIF.Level of Evidence: 3."]}
{"question": "Can students' scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations predict that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine whether preclerkship performance examinations could accurately identify medical students at risk for failing a senior clinical performance examination (CPE). METHOD: This study used a retrospective case-control, multiyear design, with contingency table analyses, to examine the performance of 412 students in the classes of 2005 to 2010 at a midwestern medical school. During their second year, these students took four CPEs that each used three standardized patient (SP) cases, for a total of 12 cases. The authors correlated each student's average year 2 case score with the student's average case score on a senior (year 4) CPE. Contingency table analysis was carried out using performance on the year 2 CPEs and passing/failing the senior CPE. Similar analyses using each student's United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 scores were also performed. Sensitivity, specificity, odds ratio, and relative risk were calculated for two year 2 performance standards. RESULTS: Students' low performances relative to their class on the year 2 CPEs were a strong predictor that they would fail the senior CPE. Their USMLE Step 1 scores also correlated with their performance on the senior CPE, although the predictive values for these scores were considerably weaker. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships."]}
{"question": "Can surgeon familiarization with current evidence lead to a change in practice?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence. METHODS: The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use. RESULTS: Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice."]}
{"question": "Does Sensation Return to the Nasal Tip After Microfat Grafting?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Patients usually complain about numbness in the nasal tip after microfat injections. The present study evaluated the severity of the numbness in the nasal tip after the procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To address the research question, a prospective study of young women was designed and performed at the Beijing Anzhen Hospital. Time was the primary predictor variable. The nasal tip sensation, which was evaluated using objective and subjective assessments, was used as the primary outcome variable. The McNemar-Bowker test (time vs nasal tip sensation) was used to detect statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 30 young women (age 20.04 +/- 3.63 years) were recruited for the present study. The preoperative mean touch threshold value was 3.60 units. One week after the injection, the women experienced a decrease in the touch threshold value by 2.50 units. However, the sensation recovered gradually during the follow-up period (1.51 units at week 2, 2.39 units at week 4, 3.01 units at week 8, and 3.35 units at week 12). Significant differences were detected between multiple different measurement points (P < .05). The percentage of those experiencing paresthesia after the microfat injections also gradually diminished to none. CONCLUSION: Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period."]}
{"question": "Pituitary apoplexy: do histological features influence the clinical presentation and outcome?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECT: A retrospective analysis of a contemporary series of patients with pituitary apoplexy was performed to ascertain whether the histopathological features influence the clinical presentation or the outcome. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in 59 patients treated for pituitary apoplexy at the University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia, or Groote Schuur Hospital, University of Cape Town, South Africa. The patients were divided into two groups according to the histological features of their disease: one group with infarction alone, comprising 22 patients; and the other with hemorrhagic infarction and/or frank hemorrhage, comprising 37 patients. The presenting symptoms, clinical features, endocrinological status, and outcome were compared between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The patients who presented with histological features of pituitary tumor infarction alone had less severe clinical features on presentation, a longer course prior to presentation, and a better outcome than those presenting with hemorrhagic infarction or frank hemorrhage. The endocrine replacement requirements were similar in both groups.", "OBJECT: The aim of this study was to correlate the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in pituitary apoplexy with histopathological results and determine whether the histopathology influences clinical presentation and outcome. METHODS: The records of 36 patients with histologically confirmed pituitary apoplexy, who were treated surgically at the University of Virginia Health System between 1996 and 2006, were retrospectively reviewed. The MR images were divided into 3 groups: 1) infarction alone; 2) hemorrhage with or without infarction; and 3) tumor only with no evidence of apoplexy. The histological examination was divided into infarction alone or hemorrhagic infarction/hemorrhage. The MR imaging findings were then correlated with the histopathological results to assess how accurately the histopathology was predicted by the MR imaging. The clinical features and outcomes of the two histopathological groups were also compared. RESULTS: The MR imaging findings were able to predict the histopathology accurately in the majority of cases. The group of patients with infarction had less severe clinical features and a better outcome than those with hemorrhagic infarction/hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging findings in the setting of pituitary apoplexy accurately predict the nature of the apoplectic process and help to guide the type and timing of therapy."]}
{"question": "Do African American women require fewer calories to maintain weight?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of obesity in African American (AA) women may result, in part, from a lower resting metabolic rate (RMR) than non-AA women. If true, AA women should require fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight. Our objective was to determine in the setting of a controlled feeding study, if AA women required fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis includes 206 women (73% AA), aged 22-75 years, who participated in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial-a multicenter, randomized, controlled, feeding study comparing the effects of 3 dietary patterns on blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. After a 3-week run-in, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 dietary patterns for 8 weeks. Calorie intake was adjusted during feeding to maintain stable weight. The primary outcome of this analysis was average daily calorie (kcal) intake during feeding. RESULTS: AA women had higher baseline weight and body mass index than non-AA women (78.4 vs 72.4 kg, P < .01; 29.0 vs 27.6 kg/m(2), P < .05, respectively). During intervention feeding, mean (SD) kcal was 2168 (293) in AA women and 2073 (284) in non-AA women. Mean intake was 94.7 kcal higher in AA women than in non-AA women (P < .05). After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no difference in caloric intake between AA and non-AA women (Delta = -2.8 kcal, P = .95). CONCLUSION: These results do not support the view that AA women are at greater risk for obesity because they require fewer calories to maintain weight."]}

METHODS: Sixty-two patients scheduled for coronary operations were randomized to warm or cold cardiopulmonary bypass. Preoperative and postoperative (7 days) neuropsychologic evaluations were performed by an observer unaware of cardiopulmonary bypass temperature. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients completed the study (cold bypass, n = 24; warm bypass, n = 30). Significant (p < 0.01) postoperative deterioration for tests of psychomotor coordination and verbal memory was noted in both warm and cold groups, but no differences were observed between groups. CONCLUSION: Temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary operations does not influence postoperative cognitive function.", "BACKGROUND: The recent introduction of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) perfusion has raised concerns regarding the associated risk of renal dysfunction through its potential to exacerbate the systemic inflammatory response and end-organ injury. This study was designed to investigate the influence of CPB perfusion temperature on renal function. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial of CPB perfusion temperature (28 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 37 degrees C) was performed in 30 patients undergoing routine coronary artery bypass grafting with normal preoperative renal function. Creatinine clearance was measured before induction of anesthesia, during CPB, and during every 12-hour period thereafter for 48 hours postoperatively. Glomerular and tubular function were assessed further by measurement of urinary creatinine, albumin, total protein, and retinol binding protein levels preoperatively, during CPB, and on days 1 and 3 postoperatively. RESULTS: Creatinine clearance increased on CPB by 51% (28 degrees C), 185% (32 degrees C), and 112% (37 degrees C) (all p < 0.01 versus preoperative values) and returned to preoperative values by 24 hours postoperatively in all three groups. Urinary albumin/creatinine ratios rose significantly from a mean of 0.4 +/- 0.1 (standard deviation) to 10 +/- 12.5 (28 degrees C), from 0.55 +/- 0.3 to 5.2 +/- 4.9 (32 degrees C), and from 0.96 +/- 0.8 to 7.8 +/- 7.0 (37 degrees C) during CPB (all p < 0.001) but decreased gradually thereafter. Also, urinary total protein/creatinine ratios rose significantly from a mean of 0.009 +/- 0.007 to 0.034 +/- 0.02 (28 degrees C), from 0.01 +/- 0.006 to 0.026 +/- 0.01 (32 degrees C), and from 0.011 +/- 0.008 to 0.033 +/- 0.02 (37 degrees C) during CPB (all p < 0.005); however, there was a further increase by 24 hours, and ratios decreased gradually thereafter. Similarly, urinary retinol binding protein/creatinine ratios rose significantly in all three groups during CPB (all p < 0.0001) and increased further by 24 hours. There was no statistically significant difference between the renal markers in the three temperature groups in any of the observations. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion temperature does not influence renal function in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.", "A debate has emerged in recently published studies about the optimum cardiopulmonary bypass temperature for good neurological outcome - warm vs. cold, i.e. normothermic vs. hypothermic. Although many comparative studies have been performed, the results of these studies are inconclusive and are difficult to interpret. Brain function has been studied in terms of neurological and neuropsychological outcome, protein S100beta levels as a marker of brain damage, and cerebral oxygenation using jugular bulb oximetry and near-infrared spectroscopy. The studies produce no conclusive proof of the superiority of warm or cold cardiopulmonary bypass. However, it appears that any degree of bypass hypothermia (< 35 degrees C) may protect the brain. On the other hand, even a slight increase in bypass temperature to > 37 degrees C may cause marked brain injury.", "In order to improve our understanding of the evidence-based literature supporting temperature management during adult cardiopulmonary bypass, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiology and the American Society of ExtraCorporeal Technology tasked the authors to conduct a review of the peer-reviewed literature, including: 1) optimal site for temperature monitoring, 2) avoidance of hyperthermia, 3) peak cooling temperature gradient and cooling rate, and 4) peak warming temperature gradient and rewarming rate. Authors adopted the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association method for development clinical practice guidelines, and arrived at the following recommendations: CLASS I RECOMMENDATIONS: a)The oxygenator arterial outlet blood temperature is recommended to be utilized as a surrogate for cerebral temperature measurement during CPB. (Class I, Level C) b)To monitor cerebral perfusate temperature during warming, it should be assumed that the oxygenator arterial outlet blood temperature under-estimates cerebral perfusate temperature. (Class I, Level C) c)Surgical teams should limit arterial outlet blood temperature to<37 degrees C to avoid cerebral hyperthermia. (Class 1, Level C) d)Temperature gradients between the arterial outlet and venous inflow on the oxygenator during CPB cooling should not exceed 10 degrees C to avoid generation of gaseous emboli. (Class 1, Level C) e)Temperature gradients between the arterial outlet and venous inflow on the oxygenator during CPB rewarming should not exceed 10 degrees C to avoid out-gassing when blood is returned to the patient. (Class 1, Level C) CLASS IIa RECOMMENDATIONS: a)Pulmonary artery or nasopharyngeal temperature recording is reasonable for weaning and immediate post-bypass temperature measurement. (Class IIa, Level C)b)Rewarming when arterial blood outlet temperature >/=30 degrees  C: i.To achieve the desired temperature for separation from bypass, it is reasonable to maintain a temperature gradient between arterial outlet temperature and the venous inflow of</=4 degrees C. (Class IIa, Level B) ii.To achieve the desired temperature for separation from bypass, it is reasonable to maintain a rewarming rate</=0.5 degrees C/min. (Class IIa, Level B) NO RECOMMENDATION: No recommendation for a guideline is provided concerning optimal temperature for weaning from CPB due to insufficient published evidence.", "A potential morbidity of incomplete re-warming following hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is cardiac arrest. In contrast, attempts to fully re-warm the patient can lead to cerebral hyperthermia. Similarly, rigid adherence to 37.0 degrees C during normothermic CPB may also cause cerebral overheating. The literature demonstrates scant information concerning the actual temperatures measured, the sites of temperature measurement and the detailed thermal strategies employed during CPB. A prospective, randomized, controlled study was undertaken to investigate the ability to manage perfusion temperature control in a group of hypothermic patients (28 degrees C) and a group of normothermic patients (37 degrees C). Eighty patients presenting for first-time, elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) were randomly allocated to the hypothermic and normothermic groups. All surgery was performed by one surgeon and the anaesthesia managed by one anaesthetist. Temperature measurements were made at the nasopharyngeal (NP) site, as well as in the arterial line of the CPB circuit. The hypothermic group had the arterial blood temperature lowered to 25.0 degrees C to maintain the NP temperature at 28.0-28.5 degrees C. During re-warming, the arterial blood was raised to 38.0 degrees C. Meanwhile, in the normothermic group, the arterial blood temperature was raised to a maximum of 37.0 degrees C to maintain NP temperature at 36.5-37.0 degrees C. Despite strict guidelines, some patients transgressed the temperature control limits. Two patients in the hypothermic group failed to reach an NP temperature of 28.5 degrees C. Twenty-six patients were managed entirely within the control limits. During rewarming in both groups, control of both arterial and NP temperature was well managed with only 25% patients breaching the respective upper control limits. During the re-warming phases of CPB, we were unable to make any correlation between NP temperature and arterial blood temperature, using body weight or body mass index as predictors. Based on the results obtained, we recommend that strict criteria should be implemented for the management of temperature during CPB, in conjunction with more emphasis being placed on monitoring arterial blood temperature as a marker of potential cerebral hyperthermia. We should, therefore, not rely on NP temperature measurement alone during CPB."]}
{"question": "Does receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improve the management of pain at the end of life?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: To compare analgesic management of daily pain for dying nursing home residents enrolled and not enrolled in Medicare hospice. DESIGN: Retrospective, comparative cohort study. SETTING: Over 800 nursing homes in Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, New York, and South Dakota. PARTICIPANTS: A subset of residents with daily pain near the end of life taken from a matched cohort of hospice (2,644) and nonhospice (7,929) nursing home residents who had at least two resident assessments (Minimum Data Sets (MDSs)) completed, their last between 1992 and 1996, and who died before April 1997. The daily pain subset consisted of 709 hospice and 1,326 nonhospice residents. MEASUREMENTS: Detailed drug use data contained on the last MDS before death were used to examine analgesic management of daily pain. Guidelines from the American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) were used to identify analgesics not recommended for use in managing chronic pain in long-term care settings. The study outcome, regular treatment of daily pain, examined whether patients received any analgesic, other than those not recommended by AMDA, at least twice a day for each day of documented daily pain (i.e., 7 days before date of last MDS). RESULTS: Fifteen percent of hospice residents and 23% of nonhospice residents in daily pain received no analgesics (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-0.74). A lower proportion of hospice residents (21%) than of nonhospice residents (29%) received analgesics not recommended by AMDA (OR = 0.65, 95% CI =0.52-0.80). Overall, acetaminophen (not in combination with other drugs) was used most frequently for nonhospice residents (25% of 1,673 prescriptions), whereas morphine derivatives were used most frequently for hospice residents (30% of 1,058 prescriptions). Fifty-one percent of hospice residents and 33% of nonhospice residents received regular treatment for daily pain. Controlling for clinical confounders, hospice residents were twice as likely as nonhospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.68-2.56). CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved."]}

{"question": "The promise of specialty pharmaceuticals: are they worth the price?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Specialty pharmaceuticals have evolved beyond their status as niche drugs designed to treat rare conditions and are now poised to become the standard of care in a wide variety of common chronic illnesses. Due in part to the cost of these therapies, payers are increasingly demanding evidence of their value. Determining the value of these medications is hampered by a lack of robust pharmacoeconomic data. OBJECTIVE: To outline emerging strategies and case study examples for the medical and pharmacy benefits management of specialty pharmaceuticals. SUMMARY: The promise of specialty pharmaceuticals: increased life expectancy, improved quality of life, enhanced workplace productivity, decreased burden of disease, and reduced health care spending comes at a significant cost. These agents require special handling, administration, patient education, clinical support, and risk mitigation. Additionally, specialty drugs require distribution systems that ensure appropriate patient selection and data collection. With the specialty pharmaceutical pipeline overflowing with new medicines and an aging population increasingly relying on these novel treatments to treat common diseases, the challenge of managing the costs associated with these agents can be daunting. Aided by sophisticated pharmacoeconomic models to assess value, the cost impacts of these specialty drugs can be appropriately controlled. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that when used in targeted patient populations, specialty pharmaceuticals may represent a good health care value.", "Through 2020, reference biologic products will lose patent protection that will be worth $54 billion to the U.S. economy. Consequently, interest in biosimilars is intensifying across the health care industry. Managed care organizations (MCOs) are depending on the savings opportunity that bio-similars promise. After the first FDA approval of a biosimilar in March 2015, the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) convened a biosimilar Partnership Forum on June 10-11, 2015. The goal of this forum was to address current readiness of MCOs to optimize biosimilars; identify gaps, challenges, and opportunities with regard to biosimilars; and recommend education and training content to help AMCP best meet the needs of its members and stakeholders. The forum brought together multiple stakeholders from MCOs, pharmacy benefit managers, specialty pharmacies, integrated delivery networks, federal government and standards setting organizations, consumer advocacy groups, and the pharmaceutical industry. Through a series of 4 one-hour webinars and a 1.5-day live workgroup session, participants identified current challenges and readiness issues in addressing biosimilars. These challenges included lack of a consolidated educational strategy for incorporating biosimilars into the clinical decision-making process; deficiencies in current levels of federal (e.g., the FDA) or state (e.g., departments of insurance) guidance; limited intelligence on pricing strategies and consideration of stakeholder contracting alignment and risk sharing; and operational implementation issues. Participants identified necessary tactics for executing a successful bio-similar strategy. These tactics included creating a broad multiple stakeholder coalition to support educational efforts to gain public, provider, and other stakeholder acceptance; aligning utilization incentives through reimbursement policies and programs; encouraging benefit design and stakeholder collaboration; advancing the coding and technology infrastructure to support operations, contracting, billing, reimbursement, and reporting needs; and having appropriate active surveillance mechanisms to enable assessment of the clinical performance of biosimilars and their innovator products. Participants recommended guidance for AMCP to optimally support its membership and stakeholders with educational and training programs at multiple venues; a platform for regular communications and updates; and advocacy, community promotion, and education.

Developments in genomics, proteomics, immunology and cellular biology are set to promise a plethora of novel targets for the industry to create and develop innovative new medicines. For a new medicine to fulfill its therapeutic and commercial potential (i.e., successful market access), it is now simply no longer a matter of its creator/developer generating evidence to demonstrate its quality, safety and efficacy to a standard expected by those responsible for making a decision on its marketing authorization ('regulators'). Nowadays, the successful market access of a new medicine not only requires market authorisation with an acceptable (i.e., competitive) label, but also that those responsible for making a decision on whether or not it is worth paying for (i.e., independent appraisal committees who advise payers as well as payers themselves; the term 'payers' has been used as an umbrella term to capture both groups) have the necessary clinical and other evidence they need to make a timely and favorable reimbursement determination at the proposed price. Typically this means that the clinical evidence for a development compound's that is available at the end of its Phase III clinical trial program to demonstrate its therapeutic value is both strong and relevant to the decisions payers are called upon to make. This poses strategic and operational challenges for the global pharmaceutical industry because the clinical evidence needs of the payers differ both qualitatively and quantitatively from those of the regulators.", "Managed health care, in its various guises from HMOs to PPOs, has been in place in Minnesota for at least 20 years and in the rest of the country for most of the last decade.

A victim not only of its own unmet promises but also of its own excesses, managed care is now facing its own demise.", "RATIONALE: Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum) is a popular medicinal fungus that has been used in traditional medicine for decades, with its provenance influencing its medicinal and commercial worth. The amount of active ingredients and the price of G. lucidum from different origins vary significantly; hence, fraudulent labeling is common. Reliable techniques for G. lucidum geographic verification are urgently required to safeguard the interests of consumers, producers, and honest dealers. A stable isotope is widely acknowledged as a useful traceability technique and could be developed to confirm the geographical origin of G. lucidum. METHODS: G. lucidum samples from various sources and in varying stages were identified by using delta (13)C, deltaD, delta (18)O, delta (15)N, C, and N contents combined with chemometric tools. Chemometric approaches, including PCA, OPLS-DA, PLS, and FLDA models, were applied to the obtained data. The established models were used to trace the origin of G. lucidum from various sources or track various stages of G. lucidum. RESULTS: In the stage model, the delta (13)C, deltaD, delta (18)O, delta (15)N, C, and N contents were considered meaningful variables to identify various stages of G. lucidum (bud development, growth, and maturing) using PCA and OPLS-DA and the findings were validated by the PLS model rather than by only four variables (delta (13)C, deltaD, delta (18)O, and delta (15)N). In the origin model, only four variables, namely delta (13)C, deltaD, delta (18)O, and delta (15)N, were used. PCA divided G. lucidum samples into four clusters: A (Zhejiang), B (Anhui), C (Jilin), and D (Fujian). The OPLS-DA model could be used to classify the origin of G. lucidum. The model was validated by other test samples (Pseudostellaria heterophylla), and the external test (G. lucidum) by PLS and FLDA models demonstrated external verification accuracy of up to 100%. CONCLUSION: C, H, O, and N stable isotopes and C and N contents combined with chemometric techniques demonstrated considerable potential in the geographic authentication of G. lucidum, providing a promising method to identify stages of G. lucidum."]}
{"question": "Do lipids, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking confer equal risk of myocardial infarction in women as in men?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Studies on coronary risk factors in men and women are mainly based on mortality data and few compare results of both sexes with consistent study design and diagnostic criteria. This study assesses the major risk factors for coronary events in men and women from the Reykjavik Study. DESIGN: Within a prospective, population-based cohort study individuals without history of myocardial infarction were identified and the relative risk of baseline variables was assessed in relation to verified myocardial infarction or coronary death during follow-up. METHODS: Of the 9681 women and 8888 men who attended risk assessment from 1967-1991, with follow-up period of up to 28 years, 706 women and 1700 men suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death. RESULTS: Serum cholesterol was a significant risk factor for both sexes, with hazard ratios (HR) decreasing with age. Systolic blood pressure was a stronger risk factor for women as was ECG-confirmed left ventricular hypertrophy (women HR 2.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67-5.01; men HR 1.11 [CI 0.86-1.43]). Fasting blood glucose > or =6.7 mmol/L identified significantly higher risk for women (HR 2.65) than men (HR 2.08) as did self-reported diabetes. Triglyceride risk was significantly higher for women and decreased significantly with age. Smoking increased risk two- to five-fold, increasing with dose, for women, which was significantly higher than the doubling in risk for men. CONCLUSIONS: This large study of the major risk factors compared between the sexes demonstrates similar relative risk of myocardial infarction associated with cholesterol for both sexes, however, the relative risk is higher in women for many other risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, elevated triglycerides and left ventricular hypertrophy."]}
{"question": "Midwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?", "retrieved_passages": ["REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review is to identify, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence for the effectiveness of internet-based e-learning programs on health care professional behavior and patient outcomes. BACKGROUND: Technological innovation has not only impacted social change in recent years but has been the prime driver of educational transformation.The newest consumers of post-secondary education, the so-called 'digital natives', have come to expect education to be delivered in a way that offers increased usability and convenience. Health care professionals (HCPs) in the clinical setting, particularly those in rural and remote communities, are no different. Today's health workforce has a professional responsibility to maintain competency in practice through achieving a minimum number of hours of continuing professional development. Consequently, HCPs seeking professional development opportunities are reliant on sourcing these independently according to individual learning needs. However, difficulties exist in some health professionals' access to ongoing professional development opportunities, particularly those with limited access face-to-face educationdue to geographical isolation or for those not enrolled in a formal program of study.These issues challenge traditional methods of teaching delivery; electronic learning (e-learning) is at the nexus of overcoming these challenges.The term e-learning originated in the mid-1990s as the internet began to gather momentum.Electronic learning can be broadly defined as any type of educational media that is delivered in an electronic form.Terms such as computer-assisted learning, online learning, web-based learning and e-learning are often used synonymously but all reflect knowledge transfer via an electronic device. This broad definition allows for a gamut of multimedia to be used for the purpose of constructing and assessing knowledge. Multimedia typically used in e-learning range from the now archaic Compact Disc Read-Only Memory (CD-ROMs), to the simple Microsoft PowerPoint, or the more advanced and complex virtual worlds such a second life. Electronic learning can be delivered in asynchronous or synchronous formats, with the latter (for example interactive online lectures via platforms such as BlackboardCollaborate or WebEx) more commonly used in formal educational settings according to set timetables of study.Person-to-person interactivity is an important enabler of knowledge generation and while functionalities such as web 1.0 (discussion board and email) and more recently web 2.0 (Wikis and blogs) allow for this to occur both synchronously and asynchronously, it is usually utilized in formal educational contexts only. However, the economy of formal education does not allow for free access to courses which proves challenging for HCPs seeking quality educational opportunities who choose not to undergo a formal program of study or are just looking to meet a specific learning need. Alternatively, asynchronous e-learning is a more learner-centred approach that affords the opportunity to engage in learning at a time and location that is convenient and enables the learner to balance professional development with personal and work commitments.These learning opportunities are self-directed and do not require a human to facilitate learning, rather, technology officiates/facilitates the learning process and, in the asynchronous e-learning context, the learner negotiates meaning independently.Health-related e-learning research has focused on several domains including media comparative designs, self-efficacy, user satisfaction, instructional design, knowledge outcomes, clinical skills development, and facilitators/barriers to its use.The benefits of e-learning are well documented in terms of increased accessibility to education, efficacy, cost effectiveness, learner flexibility and interactivity.However, some fundamental methodological and philosophical flaws exist in e-learning research, not least the use of comparative design studies. Comparison between e-learning and traditional teaching methods are illogical and methodologically flawed because comparison groups are heterogeneous, lack uniformity and have multiple confounders that cannot be adjusted for.As early as 1994, researchersin computer-assisted learning were citing these limitations and called for a fresh research agenda in this area. Cookrepeated this call in 2005 and again in 2009 and noted a paucity of research related to patient or clinical practice outcomes. Electronic learning is not an educational panacea and research needs to progress from pre- and post-interventional and comparative designs that evaluate knowledge increases and user satisfaction. It is time to move towards determining whether improved self-efficacy or knowledge gained through e-learning improves patient outcomes or influences clinical behavior change and whether these changes are sustained. In order to develop the empirical evidence base in e-learning, research needs to be guided by established theoretical frameworks and use validated instruments to move from assessing knowledge generation towards improving our understanding of whether e-learning improves HCP behavior and more importantly, patient outcomes.One suitable framework that is congruent with e-learning research is Kirkpatrick'sfour levels of evaluation. Kirkpatrick's model is hierarchically based with level one relating to student reaction and how well the learner is satisfied with the education program. Level two pertains to learning and the evaluation of knowledge, level three expands on this and considers whether the education has influenced behavior. In the context of this review, behavior change is any practice that is intrinsically linked with the outcomes of the e-learning program undertaken. Finally, level four evaluates the impact on outcomes such as cost benefit or quality improvements.The majority of e-learning research has focused on participant experience and knowledge acquisition, outcomes that correspond with the first two levels of Kirkpatrick's model.To date, few studies have examined the effectiveness of internet-based e-learning programs on HCP behavior, which aligns with Level 3 of Kirkpatrick's model.Studies exist that use self-reported measures of intention to change behavior, however self-reported intention to change does not necessarily translate into actual behavior change. Studies that have not used self-reported measures of behavior change have used objectively measured evaluation criteria including objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) using various methods including simulation task trainers and clinical simulations using standardized patients scored by a panel of experts using standardized assessment tools. Carney et al. used a national reporting and data system to measure the impact of a single one hour e-learning program undertaken by radiologists (n=31) aimed at reducing unnecessary recall during mammography screening. Carney et al. reported a null effect and attributed this to the complexities of behavior change, suggesting that longer term reinforcement of principles relating to mammography recall was required to effect behavior change. These findings also suggest that a multi-modal intervention may be required in order to reduce excessive recall rates in this area, rather than a single intervention. Contrary to Carney et al., Pape-Koehler et al. and Smeekins et al. reported positive findings using randomized controlled designs to test the efficacy of e-learning interventions on individual's surgical performance and the detection of child abuse, respectively. Pape-Koehler et al. used a 2x2 factorial design to demonstrate that an e-learning intervention significantly improved novice surgeon (n=70) surgical performance of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (change between pre-post test OSATS p 0.001) when used in isolation or in combination with a practical training session compared to practical training alone. Smeekins et al. demonstrated that a 2 hour e-learning program improved nurses' (n=25) ability to detect child abuse in an emergency department. The nurses in the intervention (n=13) group demonstrated significantly better (p=0.022) questioning techniques and consequently, higher quality history taking, to determine children at risk of child abuse when compared with the control group who received no training at all.These three exemplar studies demonstrate the broad range of applications e-learning has in HCP education, as each study used different designs, had different subject areas and target health care professionals. This reflects the conceptual and practical challenges of the area of research that addresses levels three of Kirkpatrick's model. For this reason, the e-learning research agenda in health should focus on whether knowledge generated through e-learning is able to be re-contextualized into clinical practice, and influence sustained clinical behavior change and patient outcomes.A preliminary search of PubMed, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, The JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, ERIC and PROSPERO was conducted to determine if a systematic review on the topic of interest already existed. This search identified four systematic reviews that specifically reviewed outcome measures of knowledge and skill improvement in the domain of e-learning. Two examined research conducted in nursing, with the other two in orthodontics. Lahti et al. systematic review examined the impact of e-learning on nurses' and nursing students' knowledge, skills and satisfaction. Lahti et al. were unable to demonstrate a statistical difference between cohorts undertaking e-learning compared to conventional teaching methods, findings that were not replicated by Du et al. This may be due to the decision by Lahti et al. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)", "BACKGROUND: Ghana is challenged with shortage of critical human resources for health particularly nurses and midwives in rural hard-to-reach communities. This shortage potentially hinders efforts towards attaining universal access to basic healthcare. More importantly, poor quality of pre-service training for health trainees has the potential to worsen this predicament. There is therefore the need to leverage emerging digital innovations like e-learning to complement existing efforts. This study was conducted several months before the outbreak of COVID-19 to investigate the preparedness, acceptability and feasibility e-learning innovation for nursing and midwifery trainees. METHODS: The study is a cross-sectional descriptive survey involving nursing and midwifery students (n = 233) in one of Ghana's public universities, located in the Volta region of Ghana. Simple random sampling technique was used to collect responses from eligible respondents using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistical analysis was done using STATA software (version 12.0). RESULTS: It was found that nearly 100% of respondents owned smartphones that were used mostly for learning purposes including sharing of academic information. Over 70% of respondents particularly used social media, social networking applications and internet searches for learning purposes. Health trainees were however constrained by low bandwidth and lack of seamless internet connectivity within their learning environments to maximize the full benefits of these e-learning opportunities. CONCLUSION: Respondents were predominantly prepared for an e-learning pilot project. These feability findings suggest e-learning is a huge potential that can be used to augment existing approaches for pre-service training of health trainees in Ghana, when implementation threats are sufficiently addressed. Compelling findings of this study are therefore timely to inform evidence-based policy decisions on innovative digitial solutions for pre-service training of health workforce even as the world adapts to the \"new normal\" situation induced by COVID-19."]}
{"question": "The Prevalence of Incidentally Detected Idiopathic Misty Mesentery on\u00a0Multidetector Computed Tomography: Can Obesity Be the Triggering Cause?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Misty mesentery appearance is commonly reported in daily practice, usually as a secondary finding of various pathological entities, but sometimes it is encountered as an isolated finding that cannot be attributed to any other disease entity. We aimed to assess the prevalence of cases with incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on computed tomography (CT) and to summarize the pathologies leading to this appearance. METHODS: Medical records and initial and follow-up CT features of patients with misty mesentery appearance between January 2011 and January 2013 were analysed. The study included cases with no known cause of misty mesentery according to associated CT findings, clinical history, or biochemical manifestations, and excluded patients with diseases known to cause misty mesentery, lymph nodes greater than a short-axis diameter of 5 mm, discrete mesenteric masses, or bowel wall thickening. RESULTS: There were a total of 561 patients in whom misty mesentery appearance was depicted on abdominopelvic CT scans. A total of 80 cases were found to have isolated incidental idiopathic misty mesentery, giving a prevalence of 7%. The common indication for CT examination was abdominal pain. There was a slight female predominance (51.3%). 67.5% of all patients were classified as obese and 17.5% as overweight. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT."]}
{"question": "Are pediatric concussion patients compliant with discharge instructions?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Concussions are commonly diagnosed in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate compliance with ED discharge instructions for concussion management. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2011 to November 2012 in a pediatric ED at a regional Level 1 trauma center, serving 35,000 pediatric patients per year. Subjects were aged 8 years to 17 years and were discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of concussion. Exclusion criteria included recent (past 3 months) diagnosis of head injury, hospital admission, intracranial injury, skull fracture, suspected nonaccidental trauma, or preexisting neurologic condition. Subjects were administered a baseline survey in the ED and were given standardized discharge instructions for concussion by the treating physician. Telephone follow-up surveys were conducted at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ED visit. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled. The majority (67%) of concussions were sports related. Among sports-related concussions, soccer (30%), football (11%), lacrosse (8%), and basketball (8%) injuries were most common. More than one third (39%) reported return to play (RTP) on the day of the injury. Physician follow-up was equivalent for sport and nonsport concussions (2 weeks, 58%; 4 weeks, 64%). Sports-related concussion patients were more likely to follow up with a trainer (2 weeks, 25% vs. 10%, p = 0.06; 4 weeks, 29% vs. 8%, p < 0.01). Of the patients who did RTP or normal activities at 2 weeks (44%), more than one third (35%) were symptomatic, and most (58%) did not receive medical clearance. Of the patients who had returned to activities at 4 weeks (64%), less than one quarter (23%) were symptomatic, and most (54%) received medical clearance. CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients discharged from the ED are mostly compliant with concussion instructions. However, a significant number of patients RTP on the day of injury, while experiencing symptoms or without medical clearance. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Care management, level IV. Epidemiologic study, level III.", "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe discharge instructions given to school-aged patients evaluated in a children's emergency department (ED) following concussion. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of children 6 to 18 years evaluated in a dedicated children's ED at a level I trauma center in 2008 following acute head trauma regardless of mechanism, identified by any of 27 International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision diagnoses for head injury, concussion, or skull fracture. Included were those presentations consistent with the Zurich definition for concussion. Excluded were hospital admission, death before admission, evidence of intoxication, or structural abnormality on imaging. Univariate and multivariate analyses determined adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for receipt of concussion-specific discharge instructions and activity restrictions. RESULTS: Of 350 eligible patients, the 218 included patients were mostly male (68%) with mean age 12.8 (SD, 3.4) years. Injury characteristics included sports-related, 42%; fall, 23%; loss of consciousness, 33%; headache, 75%; dizziness, 29%; amnesia, 25%; and vomiting, 19%. Most patients underwent imaging (81%). Discharge characteristics included concussion stated in final diagnosis, 31%; concussion-specific instructions, 62%; and activity restrictions, 34%. Concussion-specific discharge instructions were more likely for loss of consciousness (OR, 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-2.36), and activity restrictions were more likely for sport-related injury (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.76) and amnesia (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.01-1.98). CONCLUSIONS: Most children meeting diagnostic criteria for concussion were discharged without concussion-specific diagnoses or activity restrictions. Given the risks associated with untimely return to both physical and cognitive activity after concussion, improved awareness and standardization of disposition are imperative for the management of these young patients in the ED.", "OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis and treatment of mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) by emergency medicine providers is greatly varied. Because of the frequency and long-term consequences associated with pediatric head injuries, it is crucial that adequate counseling is provided in acute care settings. The purpose of our study is to evaluate existing practices at Loyola University Medical Center emergency department to address inconsistencies in diagnostic or discharge practices and determine future quality improvement measures. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at an academic hospital emergency department of patient records from 2017 to 2020. Demographic, diagnostic, and discharge data were summarized, and Pearson chi2 tests and Fisher exact tests were performed to determine associations among patient characteristics and provider practices. RESULTS: A total of 1160 patients met inclusion criteria for analysis. In terms of diagnostic procedure, 31.6% of providers did not uniformly use existing screening criteria, such as PECARN, to determine if CT scans were needed for mTBI evaluation. Most discharge instructions were based on a generalized template on epic (91.9%). Only a minority of providers prepared patient-specific instructions through written, verbal, or other supplemental materials. The most common formats included epic only (46.1%), epic and personalized written instructions (20.2%), and epic and verbal instructions (12.4%). Follow-up care instructions were provided to 93% of patients who received discharged instructions, mainly for primary care (96.7%), sports medicine (1.58%), neurology (0.65%), or other providers (1.11%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of consistency in the evaluation and education of mTBI in pediatric patients. There is a need for personalized discharge instructions to ensure adequate patient and parent understanding and compliance. Further studies looking at long-term outcomes in these patients would also be beneficial."]}
{"question": "Is the zeolite hemostatic agent beneficial in reducing blood loss during arterial injury?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled hemorrhage is the leading cause of fatality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zeolite mineral (QuikClot - Advanced Clotting Sponge [QC-ACS]) on blood loss and physiological variables in a swine extremity arterial injury model. METHODS: Sixteen swine were used. Oblique groin incision was created and a 5 mm incision was made. The animals were allocated to: control group (n: 6): Pressure dressing was applied with manual pressure over gauze sponge; or QC group (n: 10): QC was directly applied over lacerated femoral artery. Mean arterial pressure, blood loss and physiological parameters were measured during the study period. RESULTS: Application of QC led to a slower drop in blood pressure. The control group had a significantly higher increase in lactate within 60 minutes. The mean prothrombin time in the control group was significantly increased at 60 minutes. The application of QC led to decreased total blood loss. The QC group had significantly higher hematocrit levels. QC application generated a significant heat production. There were mild edematous and vacuolar changes in nerve samples. CONCLUSION: According to the physiological parameters, we observed that zeolite tends to reduce blood loss, however could not stop bleeding completely. We believe that further clinical trials are needed to conclude that zeolite could be used in the routine practice."]}
{"question": "Treatment as prevention in resource-limited settings: is it feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: Recently, there has been increasing interest in the role of \"treatment as prevention\" (TasP). Some of the questions regarding TasP strategies arise from the perceived difficulties in achieving and maintaining viral load (VL) suppression over time and the risk of emergence of viral resistance that could compromise future treatment options. This study was conducted to assess these questions in a resource-limited setting. METHODOLOGY: We performed a retrospective observational study of HIV-infected patients diagnosed in the pre-HAART era on follow-up at a private center from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from clinical charts. Analyses were performed to test for potential associations of selected variables with current virologic failure or use of third-line drugs. RESULTS: Of 619 patients on follow-up, 82 (13.2%) were diagnosed in the pre-HAART era. At the time of our study, 79 (96.3%) patients were on HAART, with a median duration of 14 years (IQR 12-15) of therapy, and exposure to mono or dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors regimens in 47.8% of cases. Sixty-nine patients (87.3%) had undetectable VL, 37 (46.8%) never presented virologic failure, and 19 (24.1%) experienced only one failure. Thirteen patients (16.5%) were receiving third-line ART regimens, with an average of 2.7-fold more virologic failures than those on first- or second-line regimens (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible."]}
{"question": "Are octogenarians at high risk for carotid endarterectomy?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Some investigators consider octogenarians as high risk patients for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The objective of our study was determine the results of CEA in the octogenarians patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1998 and May 2008, 755 CEAs were performed by the first author. Of these, 73 (9.7%) were performed in 69 octogenarians (40 men, 29 women) with a median age of 83 years (range, 80 to 90 years ). Before the procedures, 46 patients (63%) were asymptomatic and 27 (37%) had a severe (>70%) asymptomatic stenosis. Hypertension (68.1%), tobacco history (47.8%) and ischemic cardiopathy (39.1%) were the most prevalent comorbidities. Surgical data and perioperative results such as ocurrence of stroke, transitory ischemic atacks, need for re-operation and death as a long term survival estimate by Kaplan Meier method were analysed. RESULTS: Of all 73 operations, there was two early (<30 days( postoperative deaths (2.7%) due to pulmonary sepsis in a patient submitted to myocardial revascularization simultaneously and due to a fatal stroke in another patient. There was one non-fatal stroke (1.4%) due to early (eighth post-operative day) carotid thrombosis; and one non-fatal myocardial infarction (1.4%). Another four patients (5.5%) were submitted to early reoperation due to neck hematoma. Of patients that have been discharged (n=67), late information was available in 55 patients (82.1%) and the Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year survival rate was 60.6%. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that CEA may be performed in selected octogenarians patients to treat carotid occlusive disease with good results. Therefore, age alone should not be considered as a prohibitive risk factor for patients candidates for CEA.", "BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy remains the most effective surgical treatment for reducing the risk of stroke in patients with significant carotid stenosis. In fact, endovascular approach is associated with a higher incidence of perioperative and long-term minor stroke when compared to carotid endarterectomy although long-term functional outcome and risk of major stroke are similar. However, advanced age resulted to be associated with an increased risk of complications after carotid endarterectomy. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the outcome of carotid endarterectomy in octogenarians in our high-volume center. METHODS: Data of all patients who underwent CEA between June 2009 and December 2014 were retrospectively recorded. Patients were categorized as aged <80 or >/=80 years. Propensity score matching based on baseline clinical variables was performed to correct for any bias. Primary outcome was the difference in combined stroke and death. Secondary outcomes included incidence of myocardial infarction, surgical reintervention, unplanned intensive care unit admission and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 2463 carotid endarterectomies were performed, including 439 patients aged >/=80 years. After propensity score adjustment all octogenarians were matched one-to-one to younger patients. No differences in combined stroke and death were found (1.10% in octogenarians vs. 0.46% in younger patients; P=0.45). Octogenarians had an increased length of hospital stay when compared to younger patients (3.1+/-0.7 vs. 3.4+/-1.3 days; P=0.0001). No differences in other secondary outcomes were found. CONCLUSIONS: Age >/=80 years does not entail an increased perioperative risk after carotid endarterectomy. Hence, surgical carotid revascularization in octogenarians can be regarded as a safe and viable alternative to best medical therapy alone when performed in high-volume centers.", "OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is proven to be the most effective treatment for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 50% or greater and asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 60% or greater. Although the prevalence of carotid artery disease increases with age, most prospective and randomized trials have excluded patients older than 80 years, implying that they are either at higher procedural risk or have decreased life expectancy. Since advanced age (>/=80 years) has been viewed as a \"high-risk\" indicator for CEA, age >/=80 years has been used as an indication for alternative treatment. The study was conducted to determine if age >/=80 years is related to increased morbidity, mortality, and length of stay in patients undergoing CEA. METHODS: In the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, 2217 CEAs were performed in 1961 patients. Three hundred sixty procedures were performed in 334 patients >/=80 years. Demographics, presentation, risk factors, operative outcome, and survival were analyzed. Contemporary literature was reviewed and the results summarized. RESULTS: In patients aged >/=80 years, compared with their younger cohort, there was no difference in stroke (1.1% vs 0.8%, P = .333) but there was a higher operative mortality (1.9% vs 0.8%, P = .053). The combined stroke/death rate was higher in octogenarians (3.1% vs 1.5%, P = .041). This difference was due to the greater stroke/death rate in symptomatic octogenarians vs asymptomatic octogenarians (6.0% vs 0.9%, P = .007). The average postoperative length of stay was 3.2 +/- 4.8 days for octogenarians compared with 2.4 +/- 3.5 days for their younger counterparts ( P < .001). Thirty-seven percent of the octogenarians were discharged on the first postoperative day vs 51% ( P < .001), whereas 13% remained hospitalized beyond 5 days vs 8% ( P = .003). Although Kaplan-Meier survival curves show a higher mortality in octogenarians, survival after CEA approaches that of the overall population. A summary of the contemporary literature of CEA in 2204 patients >/=80 shows an operative stroke rate of 2.23% and death rate of 1.28%, with a combined stroke/death rate of 3.51%. CONCLUSION: CEA is a safe and effective procedure in the octogenarian. The combined stroke/death rate is increased in patients aged >/=80, indicating increased risk, predominantly in symptomatic patients. Although CEA risk in octogenarians is higher compared with a younger cohort, outcomes remain within acceptable national guidelines and within outcome measures known to confer benefit compared with best medical care. Therefore, the term \"high risk\" should not be arbitrarily applied to patients reaching the 80-year threshold. This is confirmed by the contemporary literature.", "BACKGROUND: Several prospective randomized trials have proved carotid endarterectomy to be safe and effective for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients younger than 80 years of age. Recently, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been approved for use in selected high-risk patients. It has been proposed that being an octogenarian places patients in this high-risk category. STUDY DESIGN: All patients between the ages of 80 to 89 years undergoing carotid endarterectomy during a 12-year period were included in the study. Information included indications for carotid endarterectomy, associated risk factors, length of stay, and hospital course. Perioperative morbidity and mortality, including neurologic events and myocardial infarction, were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 103 carotid endarterectomies were performed in 95 octogenarians. Procedures were performed on 59 men and 36 women. Indications for operation included symptomatic carotid stenosis in 44 patients (43%) and asymptomatic carotid stenosis in 59 (57%). Associated risk factors included diabetes mellitus (17%), hypertension (76%), coronary artery disease (28%), hyperlipidemia (39%), and history of smoking (42%). There were 4 perioperative neurologic complications, which included 1 transient ischemic attack (0.97%), 2 minor strokes (1.94%), and 1 major stroke (0.97%). There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in Japanese octogenarians. METHODS: This study prospectively included 157 consecutive CEA procedures in 145 patients treated at Fukuoka University Hospital between May 2008 and April 2013. Clinical and radiologic findings were obtained from the medical records and by telephone interview. Major events and outcomes were compared between patients 80 years of age or older (octogenarians) and those less than 79 years of age (nonoctogenarians). RESULTS: The rate of major adverse events (major stroke, myocardial infarction, or death) in the perioperative period was 1.2%. Follow-up data were available for 142 patients (97.9%). Only 1 case (.7%) of ipsilateral stroke occurred during the follow-up period. Thirteen patients died of causes other than stroke. The estimated 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 98.5%, 96.9%, and 93.1%, respectively. Nineteen (13.4%) of the patients were octogenarians. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between octogenarians and nonoctogenarians, except for age. In octogenarians, there were no major adverse events during the perioperative period and no cases of stroke or stroke-related death during the follow-up period. The estimated 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates in octogenarians were 92.9%, 92.9%, and 61.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference in overall survival between octogenarians and nonoctogenarians (P = .371). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that CEA can be safely performed in Japanese octogenarians. Midterm outcomes were relatively good, but long-term outcomes require further study."]}
{"question": "Has the mammography quality standards act affected the mammography quality in North Carolina?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The United States Food and Drug Administration implemented federal regulations governing mammography under the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) of 1992. During 1995, its first year in implementation, we examined the impact of the MQSA on the quality of mammography in North Carolina. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All mammography facilities were inspected during 1993-1994, and again in 1995. Both inspections evaluated mean glandular radiation dose, phantom image evaluation, darkroom fog, and developer temperature. Two mammography health specialists employed by the North Carolina Division of Radiation Protection performed all inspections and collected and codified data. RESULTS: The percentage of facilities that met quality standards increased from the first inspection to the second inspection. Phantom scores passing rate was 31.6% versus 78.2%; darkroom fog passing rate was 74.3% versus 88.5%; and temperature difference passing rate was 62.4% versus 86.9%. CONCLUSION: In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine which factors affected the decrease in average glandular dose recorded at the annual U.S. Food and Drug Administration Mammography Quality Standards Act inspections of mammography equipment in North Carolina from 2002 through 2005. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Average glandular dose, half-value layer, kVp, equipment age, processing speed, and system speed for every mammography unit in the state were collected by Food and Drug Administration-trained state inspectors. A mixed-effect model was used to evaluate the changes of glandular dose over time and to identify the factors associated with these changes. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease in average glandular dose in North Carolina since 2002. Factors that were statistically significantly associated with this effect were changes in kVp, equipment age, processing speed, and system speed. CONCLUSION: Average glandular dose for mammography has decreased in North Carolina after 2002. This change is probably at least partially due to the cumulative effect of direct intervention by mammography consultants and statewide educational seminars on mammography quality control.", "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine which factors affected the increase in average glandular dose recorded at the annual US Food and Drug Administration Mammography Quality Standards Act inspections of mammography equipment in North Carolina from 1997 to 2001. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Average glandular dose, HVL, kVp, ambient light, luminance, equipment age, processing speed, and system speed for every mammography unit at all facilities in the state were collected by state inspectors. A mixed-effect model was used to assess the average changes of glandular dose over time and to identify the factors associated with these changes. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase in the average glandular dose in North Carolina in 1999, 2000, and 2001 when compared with the baseline year of 1997. Factors that were statistically significantly linked to this effect were changes in kVp, processing speed, and system speed. CONCLUSION: Average glandular dose for mammography has recently increased in North Carolina. This change is likely caused by changes in screen-film products and processing techniques."]}
{"question": "Does a dedicated discharge coordinator improve the quality of hospital discharge?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the role of a discharge coordinator whose sole responsibility was to plan and coordinate the discharge of patients from medical wards. DESIGN: An intervention study in which the quality of discharge planning was assessed before and after the introduction of a discharge coordinator. Patients were interviewed on the ward before discharge and seven to 10 days after being discharged home. SETTING: The three medical wards at the Homerton Hospital in Hackney, East London. PATIENTS: 600 randomly sampled adult patients admitted to the medical wards of the study hospital, who were resident in the district (but not in institutions), were under the care of physicians (excluding psychiatry), and were discharged home from one of the medical wards. The sampling was conducted in three study phases, over 18 months. INTERVENTIONS: Phase I comprised base line data collection; in phase II data were collected after the introduction of the district discharge planning policy and a discharge form (checklist) for all patients; in phase III data were collected after the introduction of the discharge coordinator. MAIN MEASURES: The quality and out come of discharge planning. Readmission rates, duration of stay, appropriateness of days of care, patients' health and satisfaction, problems after discharge, and receipt of services. RESULTS: The discharge coordinator resulted in an improved discharge planning process, and there was a reduction in problems experienced by patients after discharge, and in perceived need for medical and healthcare services. There was no evidence that the discharge coordinator resulted in a more timely or effective provision of community services after discharge, or that the appropriateness or efficiency of bed use was improved. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.", "INTRODUCTION: A discharge coordinator role was evaluated to determine if it resulted in more discharges before noon, decreased length of stay, and prepared families for self-care at home. METHOD: This evaluation took place at a pediatric cardiac care unit. Discharges before noon, reasons for delays, and length of stay were analyzed before and after the discharge coordinator role. Parental knowledge assessments were completed a week after discharge. A nursing survey measured satisfaction with the patient discharge process. RESULTS: Rates of discharge before noon increased (31.68% vs. 44.39%) and length of stay decreased (97.16 vs. 85.24 hr) with a discharge coordinator. Parental knowledge assessment revealed fewer deficits, and nurses were satisfied. DISCUSSION: A dedicated person to coordinate patient discharge needs can improve discharge efficiency and increase the likelihood of successful self-care at home. Further evaluation is needed to determine how this role impacts readmission.", "In recent years, demographic developments, changes in the financing of hospitals as well as demands for integrated care approaches by health and social policy makers have brought the issue of an improved hospital discharge management to the forefront. The article discusses results of an evaluation study of a Viennese model project on indirect discharge management at the Kaiser-Franz-Josef-Hospital in Vienna. The service coordinated at hospital level is provided by ambulant nurses for specific wards of the hospital. The data of the study show that the target group consists primarily of old patients with multiple illnesses requiring home care services as well as patients being transferred to nursing homes. The evaluation proves that patients and their families are highly satisfied with the service. Dedicated contact persons really provide crucial support to patients and relatives in this emotionally distressed transitional period, seeing their clients through difficult decisions. Discharge managers and clients jointly find out actual needs of the patient and discuss possible solutions considering available resources of the respective lay system and ways to strengthen it. The outcome is a tailor-made care package, coordinated across professional services, matching the patients' needs and resources. Moreover the study illustrates that concepts of transitional nursing care require extraordinary skills and competences on the part of the discharge manager, currently not covered by the Austrian curriculum for nurses.", "A goal of Medicare's bundled payment models is to improve quality and control costs after hospital discharge. Little is known about how participating hospitals are focusing their efforts to achieve these objectives, particularly around the use of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). To understand hospitals' approaches, we conducted semistructured interviews with an executive or administrator in each of twenty-two hospitals and health systems participating in Medicare's Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model or its Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative for lower extremity joint replacement episodes. We identified two major organizational responses. One principal strategy was to reduce SNF referrals, using risk-stratification tools, patient education, home care supports, and linkages with home health agencies to facilitate discharges to home. Another was to enhance integration with SNFs: fifteen hospitals or health systems in our sample had formed networks of preferred SNFs to exert influence over SNF quality and costs. Common coordination strategies included sharing access to electronic medical records, embedding providers across facilities, hiring dedicated care coordination staff, and creating platforms for data sharing. As hospitals presumably move toward home-based care and more selective SNF referrals, more evidence is needed to understand how these discharge practices affect the quality of care and patient outcomes.", "OBJECTIVES: Enhancing care coordination and reducing hospital readmissions have been a focus of multiple quality improvement (QI) initiatives. Project BOOST (Better Outcomes by Optimizing Safe Transitions) aims to enhance the discharge transition from hospital to home. Previous research indicates that QI initiatives originating externally often face difficulties gaining momentum or effecting lasting change in a hospital. We performed a qualitative evaluation of Project BOOST implementation by examining the successes and failures experienced by six pilot sites. We also evaluated the unique physician mentoring component of this program. Finally, we examined the impact of intensification of the physician mentoring model on adoption of BOOST interventions in two later Illinois cohorts (27 hospitals). METHODS: Qualitative analysis of six pilot hospitals used a process of methodological triangulation and analysis of the BOOST enrollment applications, the listserv, and content from telephone interviews. Evaluation of BOOST implementation at Illinois hospitals occurred via mid-year and year-end surveys. RESULTS: The identified common barriers included inadequate understanding of the current discharge process, insufficient administrative support, lack of protected time or dedicated resources, and lack of frontline staff buy-in. Facilitators of implementation included the mentor, a small beginning, teamwork, and proactive engagement of the patient. Notably, hospitals viewed their mentors as essential facilitators of change. Sites consistently commented that the individualized mentoring was extremely helpful and provided significant accountability and stimulated creativity. In the Illinois cohorts, the improved mentoring model showed more complete implementation of BOOST interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of Project BOOST was well received by hospitals, although sites faced substantial barriers consistent with other QI research reports. The unique mentorship element of Project BOOST proved extremely valuable in helping sites overcome their distinctive challenges and identify facilitators for success. The findings from this qualitative study should contribute to future BOOST implementation success and others' efforts to optimize hospital discharge transitions."]}
{"question": "Does performance in selection processes predict performance as a dental student?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: This study investigated associations between the performance of dental students in each of the three components of the selection procedure [academic average, Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT) and structured interview], socio-demographic characteristics and their academic success in an undergraduate dental surgery programme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Longitudinal review of admissions data relating to students entering dental education at the University of Otago, New Zealand, between 2004 and 2009 was compared with academic performance throughout the dental programme. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: After controlling for variables, pre-admission academic average, UMAT scores and interview performance did not predict performance as a dental student. Class place in second year, however, was a strong predictor of class place in final year. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the best predictors of higher class placement in the final year were New Zealand European ethnicity and domestic (rather than international) student status. Other socio-demographic characteristics were not associated with performance. These interim findings provide a sound base for the ongoing study. CONCLUSION: The study found important socio-demographic differences in pre-admission test scores, but those scores did not predict performance in the dental programme, whether measured in second year or in final year.", "It is important for dental schools to select students who will complete their degree and progress on to become the dentists of the future. The process should be transparent, fair and ethical and utilise selection tools that select appropriate students. The interview is an integral part of UK dental schools student selection procedures. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken in order to determine whether different interview methods (Cardiff with a multiple mini interview and Newcastle with a more traditional interview process) along with other components used in selection predicted academic performance in students. METHODS: The admissions selection data for two dental schools (Cardiff and Newcastle) were collected and analysed alongside student performance in academic examinations in Year 1 of the respective schools. Correlation statistics were used to determine whether selection tools had any relevance to academic performance once students were admitted to their respective Universities. RESULTS: Data was available for a total of 177 students (77 Cardiff and 100 Newcastle). Examination performance did not correlate with admission interview scores at either school; however UKCAT score was linked to poor academic performance. DISCUSSION: Although interview methodology does not appear to correlate with academic performance it remains an integral and very necessary part of the admissions process. Ultimately schools need to be comfortable with their admissions procedures in attracting and selecting the calibre of students they desire.", "AIM: To assess the association between the admissions performance and subsequent academic achievement within a graduate-entry dental school. METHODS: The study was conducted at the University of Aberdeen Dental School. UCAS forms for course applicants were reviewed and assigned a pre-admission score (PAS) and a tariff given for the UCAS personal statement (UCAS). Individuals ranked highest were invited to attend multiple mini-interviews (MMI), which were scored. Data was correlated with academic performance reported as the University Common Assessment Scale (0-20). Comparisons were also made between the first degree and subsequent educational achievement. STATISTICS: Data were analysed by multiple linear regression, Pearson correlation and unstacked ANOVA (IBM SPSS Statistics 19). RESULTS: Data were obtained for 75 students (F: 50; M: 25). A correlation between performance at MMI and CAS scores was identified (r = 0.180, p = 0.001, df = 538). A correlation was also noted between each student's first degree and the CAS scores (F = 4.08, p = 0.001, df = 9).

Archival records from the International Dental Program (IDP) at Loma Linda University provided data on 171 students who had trained in countries outside the United States. The students sought admission to the D.D.S. degree program, successful completion of which qualified them to sit for U.S. licensure. As with most dental schools, competition is high for admission to the D.D.S. program. The study's goal was to identify what measures contributed to a fair and accurate selection process for dental school applicants from other nations.

{"question": "Is an advance care planning model feasible in community palliative care?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: This article reports a study to determine the feasibility of an advance care planning model developed with Australian community palliative care services. BACKGROUND: An effective advance care planning programme involves an organizational wide commitment and preparedness for health service reform to embed advance care planning into routine practice. Internationally, such programmes have been implemented predominantly in aged and acute care with more recent work in primary care. METHODS: A multi-site action research was conducted over a 16-month period in 2007-2009 with three Victorian community palliative care services. Using mixed method data collection strategies to assess feasibility, we conducted a baseline audit of staff and clients; analysed relevant documents (client records, policies, procedures and quality improvement strategies) pre-implementation and post-implementation and conducted key informant interviews (n = 9). SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Three community palliative care services: one regional and two metropolitan services in Victoria, Australia. RESULTS: The services demonstrated that it was feasible to embed the Model into their organizational structures. Advance care planning conversations and involvement of family was an important outcome measure rather than completion rate of advance care planning documents in community settings. Services adapted and applied their own concept of community, which widened the impact of the model. Changes to quality audit processes were essential to consolidate the model into routine palliative care practice. CONCLUSION: An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.", "BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence shows that advance care planning is effective in improving outcomes. However, its applicability and acceptability outside Western cultures remain unknown. Examination of relevant cultural adaptations is required prior to wider adoption. AIM: To examine the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted advance care planning intervention in a Taiwanese inpatient hospital for advanced cancer patients, family members and healthcare professionals. METHODS: A single-group, non-controlled, mixed methods feasibility study guided by a previously developed logic model. The culturally adapted advance care planning intervention represented a one-time intervention, comprising pre-advance care planning preparation and follow-up consultation. Qualitative interviews explored participants' view on their involvement in the study. Patients' medical records were examined to assess intervention fidelity. Findings from both data sets were integrated following analysis. RESULTS: N = 29 participants (n = 10 patients; n = 10 family members and n = 9 healthcare professionals) participated in the intervention, of who 28 completed follow-up interviews. Of the 10 advance care planning interventions delivered, most components (n = 10/13) were met. Key contextual moderators influencing the intervention feasibility included: (1) resource constraints resulting in increased workload; (2) care decisions informed by relatives' experiences of care; (3) the requirement for financial and policy support; and (4) a presumption for end-of-life care provision and surrogate decision-making. Six areas of intervention refinement were identified for future research. CONCLUSION: Implementing a culturally adapted advance care planning intervention in an inpatient hospital setting in Taiwan is possible. The participants reported the intervention to be acceptable. However, careful attention to the conceptual underpinning using local primary data is imperative for its success.", "INTRODUCTION: Healthcare models for the delivery of palliative care to rural populations encounter common challenges: service gaps, the cost of the service in relation to the population, sustainability, and difficulty in demonstrating improvements in outcomes. Although it is widely agreed that a community capacity-building approach to rural palliative care is essential, how that approach can be achieved, evaluated and sustained remains in question. The purpose of this community-based research project is to test the feasibility and identify potential outcomes of implementing a rural palliative supportive service (RPaSS) for older adults living with life-limiting chronic illness and their family caregiver in the community. This paper reports on the feasibility aspects of the study. METHODS: RPaSS is being conducted in two co-located rural communities with populations of approximately 10 000 and no specialized palliative services. Participants living with life-limiting chronic illness and their family caregivers are visited bi-weekly in the home by a nurse coordinator who facilitates symptom management, teaching, referrals, psychosocial and spiritual support, advance care planning, community support for practical tasks, and telephone-based support for individuals who must commute outside of the rural community for care. Mixed-method collection strategies are used to collect data on visit patterns; healthcare utilization; family caregiver needs; and participant needs, functional performance and quality of life. RESULTS: A community-based advisory committee worked with the investigative team over a 1-year period to plan RPaSS, negotiating the best fit between research methods and the needs of the community. Recruitment took longer than anticipated with service capacity being reached at 8 months. Estimated service capacity of one nurse coordinator, based on bi-weekly visits, is 25 participants and their family caregivers. A total of 393 in-person visits and 53 telephone visits were conducted between January 2013 and May 2014. Scheduled in-person visit duration showed a mean of 67 minutes. During this same time period only 19 scheduled visits were declined, and there was no study attrition except through death, indicating a high degree of acceptability of the intervention. The primary needs that were addressed during these visits have been related to chronic disease management, and the attending physical symptoms were addressed through teaching and support. The use of structured quality of life and family caregiver needs assessments has been useful in facilitating communication, although some participants experienced the nature of the questions as too personal in the early stages of the relationship with the nurse coordinator. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study illustrate the feasibility of providing home-based services for rural older adults living with life-limiting chronic illness. The RPaSS model has the potential to smooth transitions and enhance quality of life along the disease trajectory and across locations of care by providing a consistent source of support and education. This type of continuity has the potential to foster the patient- and family-centered approach to care that is the ideal of a palliative approach. Further, the use of a rural community capacity-building approach may contribute to sustainability, which is a particularly important part of rural health service delivery.", "CONTEXT: Patients with serious medical problems who live at home may not be able to access specialist-level palliative care when the need develops. Nurse practitioner (NP)-based models may be able to increase the availability of specialist care in the community. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the financial sustainability and feasibility of two NP-based models in an urban setting. METHODS: In one model, an NP was linked with a social worker (SW) to create a new palliative home care team (PHCT-NP-SW), which would provide consultation and direct care to referred homebound elderly patients with advanced illnesses. In a second model, an NP was assigned to a hospice program (Hospice-NP) for the purpose of enhancing the reach and impact of a home care team. The revenue generated by each model was compared with direct costs; the PHCT-NP-SW model also was evaluated for its feasibility and impact on patient-level outcomes. RESULTS: Over a two-year period, the NP in the PHCT-NP-SW model made 350 visits and followed 114 patients at home. Annualized revenue through reimbursement from patient billing offset less than 50% of the NP's salary costs. In contrast, the Hospice-NP model led to a 360% increment in hospice referrals, yielding sufficient new revenue to support this position indefinitely after only seven months. The PHCT-NP-SW model provided numerous interventions that yielded a significant decline in symptom distress during the initial two weeks after referral (P=0.003), 100% compliance with advance care planning, 21% admission rate to hospice, access to other community services, and crisis management. Nonetheless, lack of funding led to closure of this model after the two years. CONCLUSION: This experience suggests that a PHCT-NP-SW model is not sustainable in this urban environment through reimbursement-based revenue, whereas a Hospice-NP model for hospice can be sustainable based on the growth of hospice census. The PHCT-NP-SW model appears to offer benefits, and additional efforts are needed to establish the funding mechanisms to sustain such programs, create mixed models of hospice and nonhospice funding, or provide a basis for sustainability through cost reduction.", "BACKGROUND: No systematic review has focused on conceptual models underpinning advance care planning for patients with advanced cancer, and the mechanisms of action in relation to the intended outcomes. AIM: To appraise conceptual models and develop a logic model of advance care planning for advanced cancer patients, examining the components, processes, theoretical underpinning, mechanisms of action and linkage with intended outcomes. DESIGN: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials was conducted, and was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. Narrative synthesis was used for data analysis. DATA SOURCES: The data sources were MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CENTRAL, PROSPERO, CareSearch, and OpenGrey with reference chaining and hand-searching from inception to 31 March 2017, including all randomised controlled trials with advance care planning for cancer patients in the last 12 months of life. Cochrane quality assessment tool was used for quality appraisal. RESULTS: Nine randomised controlled trials were included, with only four articulated conceptual models. Mechanisms through which advance care planning improved outcomes comprised (1) increasing patients' knowledge of end-of-life care, (2) strengthening patients' autonomous motivation, (3) building patients' competence to undertake end-of-life discussions and (4) enhancing shared decision-making in a trustful relationship. Samples were largely highly educated Caucasian. CONCLUSION: The use of conceptual models underpinning the development of advance care planning is uncommon. When used, they identify the individual behavioural change. Strengthening patients' motivation and competence in participating advance care planning discussions are key mechanisms of change. Understanding cultural feasibility of the logic model for different educational levels and ethnicities in non-Western countries should be a research priority."]}
{"question": "Sub-classification of low-grade cerebellar astrocytoma: is it clinically meaningful?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to identify prognostic factors for the survival of children with cerebellar astrocytoma, and to evaluate the reproducibility and prognostic value of histological sub-classification and grading. METHODS: Children aged 0-14 years treated in Denmark for a cerebellar astrocytoma in the period 1960-1984 were included and followed until January 2001 or until their death. The histological specimens from each patient were reviewed for revised grading and classification according to three different classification schemes: the WHO, the Kernohan and the Daumas-Duport grading systems. RESULTS: The overall survival rate was 81% after a follow-up time of 15-40 years. The significant positive prognostic factors for survival were \"surgically gross-total removal\" of the tumour at surgery and location of the tumour in the cerebellum proper as opposed to location in the fourth ventricle. No difference in survival time was demonstrated when we compared pilocytic astrocytoma and fibrillary astrocytoma. Moreover, we found that the Kernohan and the WHO classification systems had no predictive value and that the Daumas-Duport system is unsuitable as a prognostic tool for low-grade posterior fossa astrocytomas. CONCLUSION: Discordant observations due to interobserver variability make histological sub-classification of low-grade cerebellar astrocytomas in children insufficient for predicting prognosis and biological behaviour. Similar survival rates in a population of paediatric low-grade cerebellar astrocytomas of grades I and II indicate that tumour grade has no prognostic significance within this group of patients. \"Surgically gross-total removal\", especially if the tumour is located in the fourth ventricle is of the highest importance for long-term survival. Histological sub-classification of the tumours has no predictive value."]}
{"question": "Is intraoperative neuromonitoring associated with better functional outcome in patients undergoing open TME?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIMS: Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) aims to control nerve-sparing total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer in order to improve patients' functional outcome. This study was designed to compare the urogenital and anorectal functional outcome of TME with and without IONM of innervation to the bladder and the internal anal sphincter. METHODS: A consecutive series of 150 patients with primary rectal cancer were analysed. Fifteen match pairs with open TME and combined urogenital and anorectal functional assessment at follow up were established identical regarding gender, tumour site, tumour stage, neoadjuvant radiotherapy and type of surgery. Urogenital and anorectal function was evaluated prospectively on the basis of self-administered standardized questionnaires, measurement of residual urine volume and longterm-catheterization rate. RESULTS: Newly developed urinary dysfunction after surgery was reported by 1 of 15 patients in the IONM group and by 6 of 15 in the control group (p = 0.031). Postoperative residual urine volume was significantly higher in the control group. At follow up impaired anorectal function was present in 1 of 15 patients undergoing TME with IONM and in 6 of 15 without IONM (p = 0.031). The IONM group showed a trend towards a lower rate of sexual dysfunction after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In this study TME with IONM was associated with significant lower rates of urinary and anorectal dysfunction. Prospective randomized trials are mandatory to evaluate the definite role of IONM in rectal cancer surgery."]}
{"question": "Can we predict which head and neck cancer survivors develop fears of recurrence?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to investigate longitudinal predictors of fear of recurrence in survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC) using Leventhal's Common Sense Model (CSM) as a framework. The research questions were as follows: (a) to what extent do HNC patients report fear of cancer recurrence? (b) To what extent are fears of recurrence manifestations of illness-related anxiety? (c) Are fears of recurrence closely related to current symptoms, disease, and treatment-related factors, or psychological/socio-demographic factors? (d) What factors are predictive of long-term fears of recurrence? METHODS: A prospective repeat measures design was employed whereby a sample of 82 newly diagnosed HNC patients (54 males, 28 females, mean age 60 years) completed measures of fears of recurrence, illness perceptions, coping, and anxiety and depression, prior to treatment and 6-8 months after treatment (fears of recurrence only). RESULTS: A third of HNC patients at diagnosis reported relatively high levels of fears of recurrence, with 12% still reporting similar levels of fear 6-8 months after treatment. Fears of recurrence were not related to any socio-demographic factor (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment) or disease, treatment, or symptom-related factors. Path analyses demonstrated that fears of cancer recurrence after treatment were directly predicted by pre-treatment fears and optimism. CONCLUSION: Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "OBJECTIVE: There has been a recent proliferation of research on quality of life (QoL) in head and neck cancer (HNC). The objective of this review was to systematically examine the evidence on psychological factors associated with QoL outcomes for HNC survivors in the post-treatment period published during 2004-2015. METHODS: Five databases were searched for studies investigating psychological factors associated with QoL in HNC survivors. Empirical studies published between January 2004 and June 2015 were included if they measured QoL as an outcome following treatment using a reliable and valid measure, examined its association with at least one psychological factor and included at least 50 HNC survivors. RESULTS: Twenty-four publications describing 19 studies (9 cross-sectional, 10 prospective) involving 2,263 HNC survivors were included. There was considerable heterogeneity in study design and diversity in measurement and analysis. Distress-related variables (depression, anxiety, distress) were most frequently investigated, and mostly reported negative associations with QoL outcomes. Associations were also observed between other psychological factors (e.g., coping, neuroticism and fear of recurrence) and QoL. CONCLUSIONS: Several psychological factors predict QoL among HNC survivors who have completed treatment. Routine screening and early interventions that target distress could improve HNC survivors' QoL following treatment. Longitudinal and population-based studies incorporating more systematic and standardised measurement approaches are needed to better understand relationships between psychological factors and QoL and to inform the development of intervention and supportive care strategies.Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."]}
{"question": "Does quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion change after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: We compared left ventricular regional wall motion, the global left ventricular ejection fraction, and the New York Heart Association functional class pre- and postoperatively. INTRODUCTION: Endomyocardial fibrosis is characterized by fibrous tissue deposition in the endomyocardium of the apex and/or inflow tract of one or both ventricles. Although left ventricular global systolic function is preserved, patients exhibit wall motion abnormalities in the apical and inferoapical regions. Fibrous tissue resection in New York Heart Association FC III and IV endomyocardial fibrosis patients has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We prospectively studied 30 patients (20 female, 30+/-10 years) before and 5+/-8 months after surgery. The left ventricular ejection fraction was determined using the area-length method. Regional left ventricular motion was measured by the centerline method. Five left ventricular segments were analyzed pre- and postoperatively. Abnormality was expressed in units of standard deviation from the mean motion in a normal reference population. RESULTS: Left ventricular wall motion in the five regions did not differ between pre- and postoperative measurements. Additionally, the left ventricular ejection fraction did not change after surgery (0.45+/-0.13% x 0.43+/-0.12% pre- and postoperatively, respectively). The New York Heart Association functional class improved to class I in 40% and class II in 43% of patients postoperatively (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational."]}
{"question": "Does occupational nuclear power plant radiation affect conception and pregnancy?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of occupational exposure in a nuclear power plant in Griefswald, Germany on male and female fecundity. METHODS: The frequency of men and women exposed to ionizing radiation through work in a nuclear power plant among 270 infertile couples was retrospectively compared to a control fertile population using a pair-matched analysis. The total cumulative equivalent radiation dose was determined. In addition, the spermiograms of the male partners in both groups were compared and correlated to the degree of exposure. RESULTS: No differences were noted in the frequency of nuclear power plant exposure between sterile and fertile groups. There was a higher rate of anomalous spermiograms in nuclear power plant workers. However, abnormalities were temporary. No correlation was found between the cumulative equivalent radiation dose and abnormal spermiograms. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that occupational exposure due to ionizing radiation should be investigated as a possible cause for involuntary temporary sterility and as a risk factor for early pregnancy disorders."]}
{"question": "Is the Retromandibular Transparotid Approach a Reliable Option for the Surgical Treatment of Condylar Fractures?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: This study evaluated the outcomes and complications of the surgical treatment of condylar fractures by the retromandibular transparotid approach. The authors hypothesized that such an approach would be safe and reliable for the treatment of most condylar fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent surgical reduction of a condylar fracture from January 2012 to December 2014 at the Clinic of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University Hospital of Verona (Verona, Italy) was performed. Inclusion criteria were having undergone surgical treatment of condylar fractures with a retromandibular transparotid approach and the availability of computed tomograms of the preoperative and postoperative facial skeleton with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Static and dynamic occlusal function, temporomandibular joint health status, presence of neurologic impairments, and esthetic outcomes were evaluated in all patients. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 25 patients. Preinjury occlusion and temporomandibular joint health were restored in most patients. Esthetic outcomes were deemed satisfactory by clinicians and patients. Neither permanent neurologic impairments nor major postoperative complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of the present study, the retromandibular transparotid approach is a viable and safe approach for the surgical treatment of condylar fractures."]}
{"question": "Does Viral Co-Infection Influence the Severity of Acute Respiratory Infection in Children?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Multiple viruses are often detected in children with respiratory infection but the significance of co-infection in pathogenesis, severity and outcome is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To correlate the presence of viral co-infection with clinical phenotype in children admitted with acute respiratory infections (ARI). METHODS: We collected detailed clinical information on severity for children admitted with ARI as part of a Spanish prospective multicenter study (GENDRES network) between 2011-2013. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was used to detect respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions. Findings were compared to an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: 204 children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. The number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity (OR: 4.356; P-value = 0.005), PICU admission (OR: 3.342; P-value = 0.006), higher clinical score (1.988; P-value = 0.002) respiratory support requirement (OR: 7.484; P-value < 0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (OR: 1.468; P-value < 0.001). In addition, pneumococcal vaccination was found to be a protective factor in terms of degree of respiratory distress (OR: 2.917; P-value = 0.035), PICU admission (OR: 0.301; P-value = 0.011), lower clinical score (-1.499; P-value = 0.021) respiratory support requirement (OR: 0.324; P-value = 0.016) and oxygen necessity (OR: 0.328; P-value = 0.001). All these findings were replicated in the UK cohort. CONCLUSION: The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) represents the leading cause of viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. The clinical picture of an RSV infection differs substantially between patients, and the role of viral co-infections is poorly investigated. During two consecutive winter seasons from October 2018 until February 2020, we prospectively included children up to 2 years old presenting with an acute LRTI, both ambulatory and hospitalized. We collected clinical data and tested nasopharyngeal secretions for a panel of 16 different respiratory viruses with multiplex RT-qPCR. Disease severity was assessed with traditional clinical parameters and scoring systems. A total of 120 patients were included, of which 91.7% were RSV positive; 42.5% of RSV-positive patients had a co-infection with at least one other respiratory virus. We found that patients suffering from a single RSV infection had higher pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission rates (OR = 5.9, 95% CI = 1.53 to 22.74), longer duration of hospitalization (IRR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.52), and a higher Bronchiolitis Risk of Admission Score (BRAS) (IRR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.70) compared to patients with RSV co-infections. No significant difference was found in saturation on admission, O(2) need, or ReSViNET-score. In our cohort, patients with a single RSV infection had increased disease severity compared to patients with RSV co-infections. This suggests that the presence of viral co-infections might influence the course of RSV bronchiolitis, but heterogeneity and small sample size in our study prevents us from drawing strong conclusions. IMPORTANCE RSV is worldwide the leading cause of serious airway infections. Up to 90% of children will be infected by the age of 2. RSV symptoms are mostly mild and typically mimic a common cold in older children and adolescents, but younger children can develop severe lower respiratory tract disease, and currently it is unclear why certain children develop severe disease while others do not. In this study, we found that children with a single RSV infection had a higher disease severity compared to patients with viral co-infections, suggesting that the presence of a viral co-infection could influence the course of an RSV bronchiolitis. As preventive and therapeutic options for RSV-associated disease are currently limited, this finding could potentially guide physicians to decide which patients might benefit from current or future treatment options early in the course of disease, and therefore, warrants further investigation.", "Bronchiolitis is the first lower respiratory tract viral infection manifesting in infants younger than 12 months of age. Our aim was to evaluate clinical and serological differences in infants with bronchiolitis from a single or from multiple viruses. Our secondary aim was to investigate differences in recurrent wheezing episodes after 12-24-36 months of follow-up. We reviewed the clinical records for 486 full-term infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis with at least one virus detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. In 431 (88.7%) patients one virus was detected and in 55 (11.3%) infants more than one virus was found. No differences were observed in the length of hospitalization, clinical severity score, O(2) supplementation or admission to the intensive care unit. Single virus was associated with higher serum C-reactive protein (C-RP) than infants with multiple viruses and higher blood neutrophil counts. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected virus. RSV alone was associated with higher C-RP (P = 0.007), compared to RSV coinfection. Infants with human rhinovirus (hRV) alone had higher white blood cell counts, higher blood neutrophils, and higher serum C-RP levels than hRV co-infection (P = 0.029, P = 0.008, P = 0.008). RSV + hRV, the most frequent co-infection, was associated with lower neutrophil count and lower C-RP levels (P = 0.008, P = 0.016) and less fever (P = 0.012), when comparing RSV versus hRV versus RSV + hRV. No differences were found in the frequency of recurrent wheezing between single versus multiple viruses after bronchiolitis. Our findings suggest that in infants with bronchiolitis multiple viral co-infections can occur, without influence in the clinical severity of the disease. Infants with co-infection seems to mount a lower inflammatory response.", "BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is considered one of the earliest and most common causes of hospitalisation in young children. Development of molecular technologies allowed a better understanding of bronchiolitis aetiology. Results from cohort studies evaluating the association between single, multiple viral infections and clinical outcomes are conflicting. Data on viral bronchiolitis in children were found to be limited in Qatar. This study aimed to determine frequency and seasonal trends of viral pathogens causing acute bronchiolitis, and to explore association between viral pathogens, disease severity and length of stay (LOS). METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study, including children admitted in 2010 and 2011 with acute bronchiolitis. Presenting history, physical examination and respiratory viral co-infections as detected by molecular assays were analysed. RESULTS: At least one virus was detected in 315/369 (85.4%) of included children with single and multiple viruses in 67 and 33% of cases respectively. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most detected virus, accounting for 51.2% followed by rhinovirus (RV) in 25.5% of cases. Fall and summer admissions were associated with longer LOS. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, retraction (OR 3.96; 95% CI 1.64,9.59) and age group 1-3 months (OR 3.09; 95% CI 1.06,9.05) were associated with longer LOS. Crepitation (OR 9.15; 95% CI 1.58,53.13), retraction (OR 4.10; 95% CI 1.05,16.12) and respiratory rate (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.28,1.66) were associated with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. Identifying the viral agent did not influence disease severity or LOS. CONCLUSION: Clinical presentation is of more relevance to LOS and disease severity than the detected viruses. Future studies should investigate the interplay between climate characteristics, population's factors and the most detectable circulating viruses.", "A wide range of human respiratory viruses are known that may cause acute respiratory infections (ARIs), such as influenza A and B viruses (HIFV), respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), coronavirus (HCoV), parainfluenza virus (HPIV), metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus (HAdV), bocavirus (HBoV), and others. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the COronaVIrus Disease (COVID) that lead to pandemic in 2019 and significantly impacted on the circulation of ARIs. The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in the epidemic patterns of common respiratory viruses among children and adolescents hospitalized with ARIs in hospitals in Novosibirsk, Russia, from November 2019 to April 2022. During 2019 and 2022, nasal and throat swabs were taken from a total of 3190 hospitalized patients 0-17 years old for testing for HIFV, HRSV, HCoV, HPIV, HMPV, HRV, HAdV, HBoV, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time PCR. The SARS-CoV-2 virus dramatically influenced the etiology of acute respiratory infections among children and adolescents between 2019 and 2022. We observed dramatic changes in the prevalence of major respiratory viruses over three epidemic research seasons: HIFV, HRSV, and HPIV mainly circulated in 2019-2020; HMPV, HRV, and HCoV dominated in 2020-2021; and HRSV, SARS-CoV-2, HIFV, and HRV were the most numerous agents in 2021-2022. Interesting to note was the absence of HIFV and a significant reduction in HRSV during the 2020-2021 period, while HMPV was absent and there was a significant reduction of HCoV during the following epidemic period in 2021-2022. Viral co-infection was significantly more frequently detected in the 2020-2021 period compared with the other two epidemic seasons. Certain respiratory viruses, HCoV, HPIV, HBoV, HRV, and HAdV, were registered most often in co-infections. This cohort study has revealed that during the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, there were dramatic fluctuations in common respiratory viruses registered among hospitalized patients 0-17 years old. The most dominant virus in each research period differed: HIFV in 2019-2020, HMPV in 2020-2021, and HRSV in 2021-2022. Virus-virus interaction was found to be possible between SARS-CoV-2 and HRV, HRSV, HAdV, HMPV, and HPIV. An increase in the incidence of COVID-19 was noted only during the third epidemic season (January to March 2022)."]}
{"question": "Cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction in elderly patients: does admission to a tertiary center improve survival?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of cardiogenic shock (CS) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains controversial and continues to be associated with a high mortality rate. The present study evaluated the outcomes of all patients having AMI complicated by CS in a single Canadian province. METHODS: All consecutive patients diagnosed with AMI and CS from October 1997 to December 2002 in Nova Scotia were included in the present study. The Improving Cardiac Outcomes in Nova Scotia (ICONS) registry was used as the principal source of data. The outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 11,300 patients with AMI were identified, with 707 complicated by CS, for an incidence of AMI+CS of 6.3%. The overall mortality rate for patients with AMI+CS was 60.1%. Multivariate regression analysis identified age older than 65 years (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.4 to 2.9) and renal insufficiency (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.4 to 3.2) as independent predictors of mortality, while access to invasive cardiac care (defined as admission or transfer to the only cardiac catheterization-capable centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia) was found to be an independent predictor of survival (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.3 to 0.5). Access to invasive cardiac care was limited to 414 (59%) patients, 250 (35%) of whom actually underwent cardiac catheterization. CONCLUSIONS: Admissions to a tertiary care centre that can provide invasive care was independently associated with improved survival, and older age and renal insufficiency were associated with death among patients with AMI and CS.", "BACKGROUND: The role of early revascularization among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock remains controversial. Angioplasty registries, while suggesting a benefit, are subject to selection bias, and clinical trials have been underpowered to detect early benefits. If an invasive strategy is beneficial in this population, patients admitted to hospitals with onsite coronary revascularization might be expected to have a better prognosis. We sought to determine whether access to cardiovascular resources at the admitting hospital influenced the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. METHODS: By use of the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project database (a retrospective medical record review of Medicare patients discharged with acute myocardial infarction), we identified patients aged > or =65 years whose myocardial infarction was complicated by cardiogenic shock. RESULTS: Of the 601 patients with cardiogenic shock, 287 (47.8%) were admitted to hospitals without revascularization services and 314 (52.2%) were admitted to hospitals with coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery facilities. Clinical characteristics were similar across the subgroups. Patients admitted to hospitals with revascularization services were more likely to undergo coronary revascularization during the index hospitalization and during the first month after acute myocardial infarction. After adjustment for demographic, clinical, hospital, and treatment strategies, the presence of onsite revascularization services was not associated with a significantly lower 30-day (odds ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.47, 1.45) or 1-year mortality (odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.49, 1.72). CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based cohort, patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock did not have significantly different adjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality, irrespective of the revascularization capabilities of the admitting hospital.", "OBJECTIVES: To compare outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiogenic shock (CS) presenting with and without out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). BACKGROUND: Despite general improvement in outcome after acute MI, CS remains a leading cause of death in acute MI patients with a high 30-day mortality rate. OHCA on top of cardiogenic shock may further increase mortality in these patients resulting in premature withdrawal of supportive therapy, but this is not known. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a retrospective study from 2008 to 2013, 248 consecutive patients admitted alive to a tertiary centre with the diagnosis of CS and acute MI were enrolled, 118 (48%) presented with OHCA and 130 (52%) without (non-OHCA patients). Mean lactate level at admission was significantly higher in OHCA patients compared with non-OCHA patients (9mmol/l (SD 6) vs. 6mmol/l (SD 4) p<0.0001). Co-morbidities were more prevalent in the non-OHCA group. By univariate analysis age (Hazard ratio (HR)=1.02 [CI 1.00-1.03], p=0.01) and lactate at admission (HR=1.06 [CI 1.03-1.09], p<0.001), but not OHCA (HR=1.1 [CI 0.8-1.4], p=NS) was associated with mortality. In multivariate analysis, only age (HR=1.02 [CI 1.01-1.04], p=0.003) and lactate level at admission (HR=1.06 [1.03-1.09], p<0.001) were independent predictors of mortality. One-week mortality was 63% in the OHCA group and 56% in the non-OHCA group, p=NS. CONCLUSION: OHCA is not an independent predictor of mortality in patients with acute MI complicated by cardiogenic shock. This should encourage active intensive treatment of CS patients regardless of OHCA.", "BACKGROUND: There are limited data on sex-specific outcomes and management of cardiogenic shock complicating ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (CS-STEMI). We investigated whether any sex bias exists in the admission to revascularization capable hospitals (RCH) or intensive cardiac care units (ICCU) and its impact on in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We used the Spanish National Health System Minimum Basic Data from 2003 to 2015 to identify patients with CS-STEMI. The primary outcome was sex differences in in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 340 490 STEMI patients, 20 262 (6%) had CS and 29.2% were female. CS incidence was higher in women than in men (7.9% vs 5.1%, P = .001). Women were older and had more hypertension and diabetes, and were less often admitted to RCH than men (from 58.7% in 2003 to 79.6% in 2015; and from 61.9% in 2003 to 85.3% in 2015; respectively, P = .01), and to ICCU centres (25.7% vs 29.2%, P = .001). Adjusted mortality was higher in women than men over time (from 79.5 +/- 4.3% to 65.8 +/- 6.5%; and from 67.8 +/- 6% to 58.1 +/- 6.5%; respectively, P < .001). ICCU availability was associated with higher use of Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in women (46.8% to 67.2%; P < .001) but was even higher in men (54.8% to 77.4%; P < .001). In ICCU centres, adjusted mortality rates decreased in both sexes, but lower in women (from 74.9 +/- 5.4% to 66.3 +/- 6.6%) than in men (from 67.8 +/- 6.0% to 58.1 +/- 6.5%, P < .001). Female sex was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 1.18 95% CI 1.10-1.27, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Women with CS-STEMI were less referred to tertiary-care centres and had a higher adjusted in-hospital mortality than men.", "OBJECTIVE: Myocarditis is a rare disease that may progress rapidly to refractory cardiogenic shock and death. In such situations, emergent initiation of mechanical circulatory assistance is the only therapeutic option to rescue these dying patients. This study was designed to evaluate the outcomes, health-related quality of life and frequencies of anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in fulminant myocarditis patients rescued by mechanical circulatory assistance, since these major components of outcome evaluation after serious illnesses have not yet been assessed in this setting. DESIGN: A retrospective, single-center, observational study and a cross-sectional survey to assess health-related quality of life by the Short Form-36 questionnaire and frequencies of anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale, respectively. SETTING: An 18-bed tertiary intensive care unit in a university hospital. PATIENTS: We analyzed the short- and long-term outcomes of 41 patients hospitalized at our institution between 2003 and 2009 and who received either a Thoratec BiVAD (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) (n = 6) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 35) to combat refractory cardiogenic shock due to fulminant myocarditis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intensive care unit survival was 68%, and four (10%) patients underwent heart transplantation. Independent predictors of in-intensive care unit death were Simplified Acute Physiology Score II >/=56 (odds ratio = 10.23) and troponin Ic >/=12 mug/L (odds ratio = 7.49) at admission. Complete follow-up (median, 525 days) was available for 26 of 28 survivors. Compared to age- and sex-matched controls, Short Form-36 evaluation of health-related quality of life revealed satisfactory mental health and vitality but persistent physical and psychosocial-related difficulties. Lastly, anxiety, depression, and/or posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were reported by 38%, 27% and 27% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical circulatory assistance rescued 68% of patients with refractory circulatory failure due to fulminant myocarditis. Greater disease severity and higher troponin Ic levels at extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation predicted poorer prognosis. Because up to one-third of the patients reported anxiety, depression, and/or posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, strategies aimed at attenuating their emotional and psychologic distress might significantly improve their long-lasting well-being."]}
{"question": "Learning needs of postpartum women: does socioeconomic status matter?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Little is known about how information needs change over time in the early postpartum period or about how these needs might differ given socioeconomic circumstances. This study's aim was to examine women's concerns at the time of hospital discharge and unmet learning needs as self-identified at 4 weeks after discharge. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a cross-sectional survey of postpartum health outcomes, service use, and costs of care in the first 4 weeks after postpartum hospital discharge. Recruitment of 250 women was conducted from each of 5 hospitals in Ontario, Canada (n = 1,250). Women who had given vaginal birth to a single live infant, and who were being discharged at the same time as their infant, assuming care of their infant, competent to give consent, and able to communicate in one of the study languages were eligible. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire in hospital; 890 (71.2%) took part in a structured telephone interview 4 weeks after hospital discharge. RESULTS: Approximately 17 percent of participants were of low socioeconomic status. Breastfeeding and signs of infant illness were the most frequently identified concerns by women, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Signs of infant illness and infant care/behavior were the main unmet learning needs. Although few differences in identified concerns were evident, women of low socioeconomic status were significantly more likely to report unmet learning needs related to 9 of 10 topics compared with women of higher socioeconomic status. For most topics, significantly more women of both groups identified learning needs 4 weeks after discharge compared with the number who identified corresponding concerns while in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to ensure that new mothers are adequately informed about topics important to them while in hospital.

{"question": "Laminoplasty outcomes: is there a difference between patients with degenerative stenosis and those with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECT: Two common causes of cervical myelopathy include degenerative stenosis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). It has been postulated that patients with OPLL have more complications and worse outcomes than those with degenerative stenosis. The authors sought to compare the surgical results of laminoplasty in the treatment of cervical stenosis with myelopathy due to either degenerative changes or segmental OPLL. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of 40 instrumented laminoplasty cases performed at a single institution over a 4-year period to treat cervical myelopathy without kyphosis. Twelve of these patients had degenerative cervical stenotic myelopathy ([CSM]; degenerative group), and the remaining 28 had segmental OPLL (OPLL group). The 2 groups had statistically similar demographic characteristics and number of treated levels (mean 3.9 surgically treated levels; p > 0.05). The authors collected perioperative and follow-up data, including radiographic results. RESULTS: The overall clinical follow-up rate was 88%, and the mean clinical follow-up duration was 16.4 months. The mean radiographic follow-up rate was 83%, and the mean length of radiographic follow-up was 9.3 months. There were no significant differences in the estimated blood loss (EBL) or length of hospital stay (LOS) between the groups (p > 0.05). The mean EBL and LOS for the degenerative group were 206 ml and 3.7 days, respectively. The mean EBL and LOS for the OPLL group were 155 ml and 4 days, respectively. There was a statistically significant improvement of more than one grade in the Nurick score for both groups following surgery (p < 0.05). The Nurick score improvement was not statistically different between the groups (p > 0.05). The visual analog scale (VAS) neck pain scores were similar between groups pre- and postoperatively (p > 0.05). The complication rates were not statistically different between groups either (p > 0.05). Radiographically, both groups lost extension range of motion (ROM) following laminoplasty, but this change was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CSM due to either degenerative disease or segmental OPLL have similar perioperative results and neurological outcomes with laminoplasty. The VAS neck pain scores did not improve significantly with laminoplasty for either group. Laminoplasty may limit extension ROM.", "OBJECT: There are little data on the effects of plated, or plate-only, open-door laminoplasty on cervical range of motion (ROM), neck pain, and clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare ROM after a plated laminoplasty in patients with ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) versus those with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and to correlate ROM with postoperative neck pain and neurological outcomes. METHODS: The authors retrospectively compared patients with a diagnosis of cervical stenosis due to either OPLL or CSM who had been treated with plated laminoplasty in the period from 2007 to 2012 at the University of California, San Francisco. Clinical outcomes were measured using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scale and neck visual analog scale (VAS). Radiographic outcomes included assessment of changes in the C2-7 Cobb angle at flexion and extension, ROM at C2-7, and ROM of proximal and distal segments adjacent to the plated lamina. RESULTS: Sixty patients (40 men and 20 women) with an average age of 63.1 +/- 10.9 years were included in the study. Forty-one patients had degenerative CSM and 19 patients had OPLL. The mean follow-up period was 20.9 +/- 13.1 months. The mean mJOA score significantly improved in both the CSM and the OPLL groups (12.8 to 14.5, p < 0.01; and 13.2 to 14.2, respectively; p = 0.04). In the CSM group, the mean VAS neck score significantly improved from 4.2 to 2.6 after surgery (p = 0.01), but this improvement did not reach the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). Neither was there significant improvement in the VAS neck score in the OPLL group (3.6 to 3.1, p = 0.17). In the CSM group, ROM at C2-7 significantly decreased from 32.7 degrees  before surgery to 24.4 degrees  after surgery (p < 0.01). In the OPLL group, ROM at C2-7 significantly decreased from 34.4 degrees  to 20.8 degrees (p < 0.01). In the CSM group, the change in the VAS neck score significantly correlated with the change in the flexion angle (r = - 0.31) and the extension angle (r = - 0.37); however, it did not correlate with the change in ROM at C2-7 (r = - 0.1). In the OPLL group, the change in the VAS neck score did not correlate with the change in the flexion angle (r = 0.03), the extension angle (r = - 0.17), or the ROM at C2-7 (r = - 0.28). The OPLL group had a significantly greater loss of ROM after surgery than did the CSM group (p = 0.04). There was no significant correlation between the change in ROM and the mJOA score in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Plated laminoplasty in patients with either OPLL or CSM decreases cervical ROM, especially in the extension angle. Among patients who have undergone laminoplasty, those with OPLL lose more ROM than do those with CSM. No correlation was observed between neck pain and ROM in either group. Neither group had a change in neck pain that reached the MCID following laminoplasty. Both groups improved in neurological function and outcomes.", "OBJECTIVE Cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) has been demonstrated to be as safe and effective as anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in the management of 1- and 2-level degenerative disc disease (DDD). However, there has been a lack of data to address the fundamental discrepancy between the two surgeries (CDA vs ACDF), and preservation versus elimination of motion, in the management of cervical myelopathy associated with congenital cervical stenosis (CCS). Although younger patients tend to benefit more from motion preservation, it is uncertain if CCS caused by multilevel DDD can be treated safely with CDA. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent 3-level anterior cervical discectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Inclusion criteria were age less than 50 years, CCS (Pavlov ratio </= 0.82), symptomatic myelopathy correlated with DDD, and stenosis limited to 3 levels of the subaxial cervical (C3-7) spine. Exclusion criteria were ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, previous posterior decompression surgery (e.g., laminoplasty or laminectomy), osteoporosis, previous trauma, or other rheumatic diseases that might have caused the cervical myelopathy. All these patients who underwent 3-level discectomy were divided into 2 groups according to the strategies of management: preservation or elimination of motion (the hybrid-CDA group and the ACDF group). The hybrid-CDA group underwent 2-level CDA plus 1-level ACDF, whereas the ACDF group underwent 3-level ACDF. Clinical assessment was measured by the visual analog scales (VAS) for neck and arm pain, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, and Nurick grades. Radiographic outcomes were measured using dynamic radiographs for evaluation of range of motion (ROM). RESULTS Thirty-seven patients, with a mean (+/- SD) age of 44.57 +/- 5.10 years, were included in the final analysis. There was a male predominance in this series (78.4%, 29 male patients), and the mean follow-up duration was 2.37 +/- 1.60 years. There were 20 patients in the hybrid-CDA group, and 17 in the ACDF group. Both groups demonstrated similar clinical improvement at 2 years' follow-up. These patients with 3-level stenosis experienced significant improvement after either type of surgery (hybrid-CDA and ACDF). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups at each of the follow-up visits postoperatively. The preoperative ROM over the operated subaxial levels was similar between both groups (21.9 degrees  vs 21.67 degrees ; p = 0.94). Postoperatively, the hybrid-CDA group had significantly greater ROM (10.65 degrees  vs 2.19 degrees ; p < 0.001) than the ACDF group. Complications, adverse events, and reoperations in both groups were similarly low. CONCLUSIONS Hybrid-CDA yielded similar clinical improvement to 3-level ACDF in patients with myelopathy caused by CCS. In this relatively young group of patients, hybrid-CDA demonstrated significantly more ROM than 3-level ACDF without adjacent-segment disease (ASD) at 2 years' follow-up. Therefore, hybrid-CDA appears to be an acceptable option in the management of CCS. The strategy of motion preservation yielded similar improvements of cervical myelopathy to motion elimination (i.e., ACDF) in patients with CCS, while the theoretical benefit of reducing ASD required further validation.", "Objective: To investigate the imaging features of patients with developmental stenosis of atlas (small atlas) complicated with degenerative cervical myelopathy and to explore the diagnostic criteria of small atlas. Methods: The clinical data of patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy treated by posterior cervical laminoplasty and resection of posterior arch of atlas from 2006 to 2020 in the Department of Orthopedics, Peking University Third Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Sixteen cases had spinal cord compression at C(1) level after the exclusion of ossification of cervical posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and other pathology. These cases were suspected small atlas (small atlas group). Forty-six cases without posterior arch resection in the same period were selected as control group. The middle sagittal diameter of atlas and the vertical distance from posterior tubercle of atlas to occipitoaxial line under CT in both groups were compared. The sagittal diameter of the spinal canal at the atlas level under MRI, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score for functional state of cervical spine before operation and at last follow-up were also measured. Results: There were 9 males and 7 females in the small atlas group, aged (63+/-12) years. There were 21 males and 25 females in the control group, aged (57+/-10) years. The patients in both group were followed-up for at least one year. The sagittal diameter of atlas in the small atlas group was (26.4+/-3.1) mm, which was significantly smaller than that in the control group [(29.6+/-2.2) mm, P=0.010]. The vertical distance from the posterior tubercle of atlas to the occipitoaxial line in the small atlas group was larger than that in the control group[(6.79+/-1.17) mm vs (5.57+/-1.29) mm, P=0.001]. The diameter of atlas canal in the small atlas group was (8.25+/-1.44) mm which was significantly smaller than that in the control group [(13.00+/-1.66) mm, P<0.001]. The JOA score of the small atlas group before operation and at the last follow-up were both slightly lower than that in the control group (both P<0.05), but there was no significant difference in the recovery rate of JOA score between the two groups (61.9% vs 66.0%, P=0.066). Among the 16 cases in the small atlas group, 5 cases of occipital-axial connection were located at the posterior 1/3 of the posterior arch of atlas, and 11 cases of occipital-axial connection were completely located at the posterior arch of atlas. Conclusions: The effective sagittal diameter of atlas is smaller in small atlas group which can lead to more severe cervical myelopathy. The presence of a small atlas should be highly suspected when the sagittal diameter of atlas canal is less than 26 mm under CT. The existence of the small atlas should be alert when the occipitalaxial line is located at the dorsal 1/3 or behind of the posterior arch of atlas."]}
{"question": "Hypotension in patients with coronary disease: can profound hypotensive events cause myocardial ischaemic events?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anginal episodes might be related to extremes of hypotension in patients with ischaemic heart disease taking drugs to treat angina and heart failure. DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational study of patients with ischaemic heart disease attending an urban tertiary referral cardiology centre. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: A selected patient population was enrolled, having: angina on one or more hypotensive cardiovascular medications; hypotension on clinic or ambulatory measurement; and a resting ECG suitable for ambulatory monitoring. Patients had echocardiography, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and Holter monitoring. Hypotension induced ischaemic (HII) events were defined as episodes of ST segment ischaemia occurring at least one minute after an ambulatory blood pressure measurement (systolic/diastolic) below 100/65 mm Hg during the day, or 90/50 mm Hg at night. RESULTS: 25 suitable patients were enrolled, and 107 hypotensive events were documented. 40 ST events occurred in 14 patients, of which a quarter were symptomatic. Fourteen HII events occurred in eight patients, with 13 of the 14 preceded by a fall in diastolic pressure (median diastolic pressure 57.5 mm Hg, interquartile range 11, maximum 72 mm Hg, minimum 45 mm Hg), and six preceded by a fall in systolic pressure (chi(2) = 11.9, p < 0.001). ST events were significantly associated with preceding hypotensive events (chi(2) = 40.2, p < 0.0001). Patients with HII events were more frequently taking multiple hypotensive drug regimens (8/8 v 9/17, chi(2) = 5.54, p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ischaemic heart disease and hypotension, symptomatic and silent ischaemia occurred in a temporally causal relation with hypotension, particularly for diastolic pressures, suggesting that patients with coronary disease may be susceptible to ischaemic events incurred as a result of low blood pressure caused by excessive hypotensive drug treatment.", "BACKGROUND: With expanding applications and increasingly aggressive stress protocols, concerns about the safety of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) have arisen. The purpose of this study was to analyse prospectively the safety, adverse event profile and complication rate of DSE. METHODS: Prospective data were recorded in a consecutive series of 474 patients undergoing DSE. Dobutamine was administered intravenously in graded infusion, each stage over 3 min, at 10, 20, 40 and, if required, 50 micrograms/kg/min. Atropine (1 mg) was administered thereafter if the response remained suboptimal. RESULTS: The mean dose of dobutamine was 42 micrograms/kg/min, with 111 patients (23%) receiving 50 micrograms/kg/min. Atropine was required for 27 patients (6%). No patient died or suffered a myocardial infarction. Sustained ventricular tachycardia occurred in one patient, angina pectoris in 127 (27%), non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in eight (2%) and supraventricular tachycardia in 19 (4%). Profound bradycardia requiring cessation of the test occurred in one patient. Pulmonary oedema developed in one patient. A hypotensive response requiring cessation of the test was seen in one patient. Test termination because the patient complained of nausea, tremor or headache was not required. CONCLUSION: DSE is safe. Side effects are rare and when they occur, are usually minor. Ischaemic pain is effectively treated by termination of the test and sublingual administration of nitrates."]}
{"question": "An HIV1/2 point of care test on sputum for screening TB/HIV co-infection in Central India - Will it work?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the OraQuick(R) HIV-1/2 Assay (OraSure Technologies, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA) in sputum is a valid tool for HIV surveillance among TB patients. METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out on sputa of patients diagnosed with tuberculosis. Sputa were tested for antibodies to HIV using OraQuick(R) HIV-1/2 Assay (OraSure Technologies, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA). The results were compared with results of serum ELISA. RESULTS: Compared to serum ELISA, the OraQuick(R) HIV-1/2 Assay in sputum specimens reported 90% sensitivity (9/10) and 100% specificity (307/307), with a positive predictive value of 100% (95%CI: 66.37%-100.00%) and a negative predictive value of 99.68% (95%CI: 98.20%-99.99%). CONCLUSIONS: This testing method may provide a useful strategy for conducting HIV surveillance in possible co-infected TB patients at peripheral centres. Since there is no investment on infrastructure, it may be possible for paramedical health professionals to carry out the test, particularly in areas with low HIV endemicity."]}
{"question": "Is routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy necessary?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND STUDY OBJECTIVE: Pneumothorax following flexible bronchoscopy (FB) with transbronchial biopsy (TBB) occurs in 1 to 6% of cases. Routine chest radiography (CXR) following TBB is therefore requested by most pulmonologists in an attempt to detect complications, particularly pneumothorax. The objective of this study was to determine if routine CXR after bronchoscopy and TBB is necessary. PATIENTS AND METHOD: The study group included 350 consecutive patients who underwent FB with TBB at our institution between December 2001 and January 2004. Routine CXR was performed up to 2 h after the procedure in all cases. Additionally, the following information was recorded in all patients: sex, age, immune status, indication for bronchoscopy, total number of biopsies done, segment sampled, pulse oxygen saturation, and development of symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. RESULTS: Pneumothorax was diagnosed radiologically in 10 patients (2.9%). Seven patients had symptoms strongly suggestive of pneumothorax prior to CXR, including four patients with large (> 10%) pneumothorax. The other three patients were asymptomatic, with only minimal pneumothorax (</= 10%), which resolved completely 24 to 48 h later. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "A chest roentgenogram is commonly obtained after a transbronchial biopsy to exclude a pneumothorax. We hypothesized that these routine chest roentgenograms rarely demonstrate a pneumothorax in patients who have neither symptoms nor fluoroscopic findings of lung collapse. To test this hypothesis, we studied 305 consecutive patients undergoing bronchoscopy with fluoroscopically guided TBB. No patient without symptoms and fluoroscopic findings suggesting lung collapse had a pneumothorax demonstrated on the post-biopsy chest roentgenogram. At the University of Virginia, routine chest roentgenograms failed to demonstrate a single unsuspected pneumothorax among all patients undergoing TBB during a period of nearly six years. Given this low incidence of unsuspected pneumothorax, we conclude that routine chest roentgenograms have a low diagnostic yield and may not be necessary in all patients after fluoroscopically guided TBB.", "BACKGROUND: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) with transbronchial biopsy (TBB) is complicated by a pneumothorax in 1-4% of cases. Performance of routine post-TBB chest radiography (CXR) results in an extremely low diagnostic yield but nevertheless is the common clinical practice prevailing today. It has previously been suggested that routine post-TBB CXR could be avoided in asymptomatic patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to prospectively assess the feasibility and safety of this approach. METHODS: The study group included 201 consecutive patients who underwent FOB with TBB at our institution between January 2009 and September 2014. All subjects completed a preprocedural, a 2-hour postprocedural, and a 24- to 48-hour postprocedural symptom questionnaire (chest pain, dyspnea, and cough). Post-TBB CXR was ordered by the treating physician only if indicated. All cases of pneumothorax were documented. Additionally, the following information was recorded: sex, age, immune status, indication for FOB, total number of biopsies done, lobe sampled, and pulse oxygen saturation. RESULTS: Sixteen CXRs were ordered by the treating physician due to suspected pneumothorax (8%). Early-onset pneumothorax (i.e. within 2 h of TBB) was diagnosed radiologically in 6 patients (3%). Two late-onset pneumothoraxes (1%) were diagnosed more than 24 h after TBB. No pneumothoraxes of clinical significance were diagnosed among asymptomatic patients without significant oxygen desaturation events. CONCLUSIONS: Among asymptomatic patients without significant desaturation events, pneumothorax is rare and usually of negligible clinical significance. Therefore, performance of routine CXR after TBB is not necessary and can be safely avoided in this category of patients.", "We have followed 106 recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and observed 47 episodes of interstitial pneumonitis (IP) in 37 patients. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis was seen in 18 episodes in 18 patients, of whom 10 patients were diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), 7 patients by autopsy, and 1 patient by sputum culture. There was one varicella-zoster virus pneumonitis diagnosed by autopsy. However, we could find no apparent etiology of pneumonitis in the other 18 patients. The median interval between BMT and episodes of IP was 74 days (range, 23-578 days) for CMV pneumonitis, and 180 days (range, 41-428 days) for idiopathic pneumonitis (p less than 0.05). BAL was more sensitive than transbronchial lung biopsy in the diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis, and CD4/CD8 ratio in BAL fluid was inverted in all episodes of CMV pneumonitis. Computed tomography (CT) scans were performed in 31 episodes in 26 patients, and all scans revealed abnormalities. CT scans were more sensitive than routine chest X-rays against micro- or small-nodular patterns, air bronchogram, and air alveologram (p less than 0.05). CT scan and arterial blood gas analysis were most useful and necessary in approaching the problem of pneumonitis in allogeneic marrow transplant patients. Based on these findings, when CMV pneumonitis is suspected, it is recommended to perform BAL for the final diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis."]}
{"question": "Is it safe to perform rectal anastomosis in gynaecological debulking surgery without a diverting stoma?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: Colorectal resection is frequently performed during cytoreductive surgery for gynaecological malignancy. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of colorectal anastomosis, and especially low rectal anastomosis, in the absence of a protective stoma in patients with gynaecological cancer and peritoneal metastasis. METHOD: Patient data were retrospectively collected from a database for gynaecological cancer procedures carried out between January 2013 and July 2015. All patients who underwent a colorectal resection during cytoreduction were included in the study. The primary outcome was anastomotic leakage in the presence or absence of a diverting stoma. Secondary outcome parameters were complications and reoperations. RESULTS: In the period of study, 43 major colorectal procedures were performed on 37 women. The most common colorectal procedure was low rectal resection (n = 22; 59%) followed by anterior rectal resection (n = 7; 19%) and sigmoid resection (n = 4; 11%). Five (14%) patients underwent Hartmann's procedure. In three (8%) patients, a diverting loop ileostomy was created. CONCLUSION: Low rectal resection during debulking procedures for gynaecological cancers with peritoneal carcinomatosis can safely be performed by an experienced surgeon without a diverting stoma."]}
{"question": "Can biofeedback training of psychophysiological responses enhance athletes' sport performance?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: In recent years, biofeedback has become increasingly popular for its proven success in peak performance training - the psychophysiological preparation of athletes for high-stakes sport competitions, such as the Olympic games. The aim of this research was to test whether an 8-week period of exposure to biofeedback training could improve the psychophysiological control over competitive anxiety and enhance athletic performance in participating subjects. METHODS: Participants of this study were highly competent athletes, each training in different sport disciplines. The experimental group consisted of 18 athletes (4 women, 14 men), whereas the Control group had 21 athletes (4 women, 17 men). All athletes were between 16 and 34 years old. The biofeedback device, Nexus 10, was used to detect and measure the psychophysiological responses of athletes. Athletes from both groups (control and experimental) were subjected to stress tests at the beginning of the study and once again at its conclusion. In between, the experimental group received training in biofeedback techniques. We then calculated the overall percentage of athletes in the experimental group compared with those in the control group who were able to control respiration, skin conductance, heart rate, blood flow amplitude, heart rate variability, and heart respiration coherence. One year following completion of the initial study, we questioned athletes from the experimental group, to determine whether they continued to use these skills and if they could detect any subsequent enhancement in their athletic performance. RESULTS: We demonstrated that a greater number of participants in the experimental group were able to successfully control their psychophysiological parameters, in comparison to their peers in the control group. Significant results (p < 0.05) were noted in regulation of GSR following short stress test conditions (p = 0.037), in regulation of HR after exposure to STROOP stressor (p = 0.037), in regulation of GSR following the Math and GSR stressors (p = 0.033, p = 0.409) and in achieving HR - breathing coherence following the math stressor (p = 0.042). CONCLUSION: One year following completion of the training program, all participants from the experimental group indicated that they were still using the biofeedback - psycho-regulation skills. Furthermore, these participants uniformly reported believing that these skills had enhanced their athletic performance and general well-being."]}
{"question": "Do cytokines have any role in epilepsy?", "retrieved_passages": ["Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder affecting approximately 8 out of 1000 people. Its pathophysiology, however, has remained elusive in many regards. Consequently, adequate seizure control is still lacking in about one third of patients. Cytokines are soluble mediators of cell communication that are critical in immune regulation. In recent years, studies have shown that epileptic seizures can induce the production of cytokines, which in turn influence the pathogenesis and course of epilepsies. At the time of this review, the focus is mostly on interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding these cytokines and their potential roles in epilepsy. The focus concentrates on their expression and influence on induced seizures in animal models of epilepsy, as well as findings in human studies. Both proconvulsive and anticonvulsive effects have been reported for each of these molecules. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that cytokines play dichotomous roles through multiple pathways, each of which is dependent on free concentration and available receptors. Furthermore, the immune-mediated leakage in the blood-brain-barrier also plays an important role in epileptogenesis. Nonetheless, these observations demonstrate the multifarious nature of cytokine networks and the complex relationship between the immune system and epilepsy. Future studies are warranted to further clarify the influence of the immune system on epilepsy and vice versa.", "Within the pathophysiology of epilepsy, as a chronic brain disorder, the involvement of neuroinflammation has been extensively implied. Recurrent seizures of epilepsy have been associated with elevated levels of immune mediators that seem to play a pivotal role in triggering them. Neurons, glia, and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) take part in such inflammatory processes by expressing receptors of associated mediators through autocrine and paracrine stimulation of intracellular signaling pathways. In this milieu, elevated cytokine levels in serum and brain tissue have been reported in patients with an epileptic profile. Noteworthy, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are the proinflammatory cytokines mostly associated, in literature, with the pathogenesis of epilepsies. In this review, we examine the function of these cytokines in connection with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) as potential proinflammatory mediators in the neuropathology of epilepsy.", "Recent findings in experimental models and in the clinical setting highlight the possibility that inflammatory processes in the brain contribute to the etiopathogenesis of seizures and to the establishment of a chronic epileptic focus. Prototypical inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 have been shown to be overexpressed in experimental models of seizures in brain areas of seizure generation and propagation, prominently by glia and to a lesser extent by neurons. Cytokines receptors are also upregulated, and the related intracellular signalling is activated, in both cell populations highlighting autocrine and paracrine actions of cytokines in the brain. Cytokines have been shown to profoundly affect seizures in rodents; in particular, IL-1 beta is endowed of proconvulsant activity in a large variety of seizure models. The recent demonstration of functional interactions between cytokines and classical neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA, suggest the possibility that these interactions underlie the cytokine-mediated changes in neuronal excitability, thus promoting seizure phenomena and the associated neuropathology. These findings point out at novel glio-neuronal communications in diseased conditions and highlight potential new targets for therapeutic intervention.", "The balance between cytokines with pro- and anti-inflammatory effects contributes to the course of the Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. TNFalpha seems to be an important factor in the cascade of events leading to demyelination and even axonal damage. During the acute phase, the serum concentrations of TNFalpha and IL-6 are elevated while anti-inflammatory cytokines are up-regulated in the recovery phase. Cytokines also have a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and most data suggest that this effect is mediated by myelin-specific CD4 T lymphocytes secreting Th type 1 cytokines. However, several different immune cells including B lymphocytes, CD8 T lymphocytes and NK T lymphocytes are also involved in the pathogenesis. Both Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes and cytokines probably participate in the development of myasthenia gravis (MG). The IFNalpha production is probably related to the severity of the disease, with clinical improvement associated with decreased production. The serum levels of IL-18 are significantly elevated in MG, with highest concentrations in patients with generalized disease. The immune system may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD by the effect of microglia, which can induce microglial activation with subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In parkinsonism, there is evidence of chronic inflammation in the substantia nigra and striatum. Activated microglia, producing proinflammatory cytokines, surround the degenerating dopaminergic neurons and may contribute to the dopaminergic neuron loss. Studies of patients with epilepsy and animals with experimentally induced seizures indicate that cytokines may also influence the electrophysiological properties of neurons.", "A large series of clinical and experimental studies supports a link between inflammation and epilepsy, indicating that inflammatory processes within the brain are important contributors to seizure recurrence and precipitation. Systemic inflammation can precipitate seizures in children suffering from epileptic encephalopathies, and hallmarks of a chronic inflammatory state have been found in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Research performed on animal models of epilepsy further corroborates the idea that seizures upregulate inflammatory mediators, which in turn may enhance brain excitability and neuronal degeneration. Several inflammatory molecules and their signaling pathways have been implicated in epilepsy. Among these, the chemokine pathway has increasingly gained attention. Chemokines are small cytokines secreted by blood cells, which act as chemoattractants for leukocyte migration. Recent studies indicate that chemokines and their receptors are also produced by brain cells, and are involved in various neurological disorders including epilepsy. In this review, we will focus on a subset of pro-inflammatory chemokines (namely CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CX3CL1) and their receptors, and their increasingly recognized role in seizure control."]}
{"question": "Colorectal cancer in young patients: is it a distinct clinical entity?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The incidence of colorectal cancer in young patients is increasing. It remains unclear if the disease has unique features in this age group. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study which included patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age </=40 years in 1997-2013 matched 1:2 by year of diagnosis with consecutive colorectal cancer patients diagnosed at age >50 years during the same period. Patients aged 41-50 years were not included in the study, to accentuate potential age-related differences. Clinicopathological characteristics, treatment, and outcome were compared between groups. RESULTS: The cohort included 330 patients, followed for a median time of 65.9 months (range 4.7-211). Several significant differences were noted. The younger group had a different ethnic composition. They had higher rates of family history of colorectal cancer (p = 0.003), hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes (p < 0.0001), and inflammatory bowel disease (p = 0.007), and a lower rate of polyps (p < 0.0001). They were more likely to present with stage III or IV disease (p = 0.001), angiolymphatic invasion, signet cell ring adenocarcinoma, and rectal tumors (p = 0.02). Younger patients more frequently received treatment. Young patients had a worse estimated 5-year disease-free survival rate (57.6  vs. 70 %, p = 0.039), but this did not retain significance when analyzed by stage (p = 0.092). Estimated 5-year overall survival rates were 59.1 and 62.1 % in the younger and the control group, respectively (p = 0.565). CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal cancer among young patients may constitute a distinct clinical entity. Further research is needed to validate our findings and define the optimal approach in this population.", "PURPOSE: This study was designed to characterize the entity of colorectal cancer (CRC) in young patients and to evaluate whether it has any unique epidemiological or clinicopathological features. METHODS: The study population consisted of all consecutive young (</=50 years old at diagnosis) patients with CRC who were diagnosed during the years 1997-2007 and were treated at our institution, and a matching group of patients (>50 years at diagnosis). The medical files of these patients were reviewed, and the epidemiological, clinical, and pathological features of both groups were compared. RESULTS: There were 406 patients: 203 in each group. The features of the older group were typical for patients with CRC, but the younger group showed female predominance, different ethnic composition, prevalence of family history of cancer and hereditary CRC syndromes, and lower incidence of polyps. The incidence of left-sided tumors and advanced stages (III-IV) at diagnosis was higher in the younger patients. Mucinous/signet ring histology, grade, stage, lymphatic and vascular invasion were all predictive of survival, whereas age was not. CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal cancer in young patients was found to display a cluster of unique characteristics but fewer than previously reported and young age by itself was not found to impact patient outcome.", "Early-onset colorectal cancer emerges as a distinctive clinical and biological entity and is generally defined as the onset of colon or rectal neoplasia before the age of 50. Several reports describe an increasing incidence worldwide of colorectal cancers occurring in individuals younger than 50 years, along with particular histologic and molecular features. Although heredity may be an explanation in some cases with young-onset colorectal cancer, other driving factors remain partially unknown. The present study explores demographic, clinical, and pathological features within a group of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer before the age of 50. It is a retrospective survey based on data collected between 2017 and 2023 within three surgical departments from a tertiary Romanian hospital. The clinical and pathological features we identified (later-stage disease, distal colon tumor localization, mucinous histology) are mainly superimposed with the existing data in the literature regarding this pathology. In order to lower the burden that colorectal neoplasia diagnosed in the young implies, a change of paradigm should be made in terms of establishing effective and targeted screening programs but also in the direction of enhancing complex clinical, pathological, and molecular diagnosis.", "Background. Early onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is rare and has been hypothesized to be a biologically and clinically distinct entity personifying aggressive disease and worse survival. Methods. Data for 131 patients was collected by retrospective chart review. Cox proportional hazard model was used to compute prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results. Early onset sporadic CRC accounted for 32% of all CRC treated in the specified time period. The mean age was 33.3 +/- 7.9 years and the male to female ratio was 2 : 1. Colon and rectal cancers accounted for 55% and 45% of patients, respectively. 96% of rectal carcinoma patients received appropriate therapy as opposed to 65% of colon cancers. On multivariable analysis, appropriate reception of therapy (PR 4.99; 95% CI, 1.21-20.6) and signet ring morphology (PR 2.40; 95% CI, 1.33-4.32) were significantly associated with rectal cancers as opposed to colon cancer. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a trend towards inferior survival for rectal carcinoma 2 years after diagnosis. Conclusion.A high prevalence of early onset CRC was noted in the study. A trend towards inferior survival was seen in patients with rectal cancer. This finding raises the possibility of rectal carcinoma being an aggressive subset of young CRC.", "AIM: To characterize colorectal cancer (CRC) in octogenarians as compared with younger patients. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cohort study which included patients diagnosed with CRC at the age of 80 years or older between 2008-2013. A control group included consecutive patients younger than 80 years diagnosed with CRC during the same period. Clinicopathological characteristics, treatment and outcome were compared between the groups. Fisher's exact test was used for dichotomous variables and chi(2) was used for variables with more than two categories. Overall survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with the log-rank test. Cancer specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards model, with the Fine and Gray correction for non-cancer death as a competing risk. RESULTS: The study included 350 patients, 175 patients in each group. Median follow-up was 40.2 mo (range 1.8-97.5). Several significant differences were noted. Octogenarians had a higher proportion of Ashkenazi ethnicity (64.8% vs 47.9%, P < 0.001), a higher rate of personal history of other malignancies (22.4% vs 13.7%, P = 0.035) and lower rates of family history of any cancer (36.6% vs 64.6%, P < 0.001) and family history of CRC (14.4% vs 27.3%, P = 0.006). CRC diagnosis by screening was less frequent in octogenarians (5.7% vs 20%, P < 0.001) and presentation with performance status (PS) of 0-1 was less common in octogenarians (71% vs 93.9%, P < 0.001). Octogenarians were more likely to have tumors located in the right colon (45.7% vs 34.3%, P = 0.029) and had a lower prevalence of well differentiated histology (10.4% vs 19.3%, P = 0.025). They received less treatment and treatment was less aggressive, both in patients with metastatic and non-metastatic disease, regardless of PS. Their 5-year CSS was worse (63.4% vs 77.6%, P = 0.009), both for metastatic (21% vs 43%, P = 0.03) and for non-metastatic disease (76% vs 88%, P = 0.028).

CONCLUSION: The incidence of abdominal injury in intoxicated, hemodynamically stable, blunt trauma patients with a normal abdominal examination and normal mentation is low. Physical examination and attention to clinical risk factors allow accurate abdominal evaluation without CT.", "BACKGROUND: We sought to determine if clinician suspicion of injury was useful in predicting injuries found on pan-body computed tomography (PBCT) in clinically intoxicated patients. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled awake, intoxicated patients with low-energy mechanism of injury. For each of four body regions (head/face, neck, thorax and abdomen/pelvis), clinician suspicion for injury was recorded as \"low index\" or \"more than a low index\". The reference standard was the presence of any pre-defined significant finding (SF) on CT. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (LR+) and negative (LR-) likelihood ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Enrollment of 103 patients was completed. Sensitivity, specificity, LR+ and LR-for clinician index of suspicion were: 56%, 68%, 1.75, 0.64 (head/face), 50%, 92%, 6.18, 0.54 (neck), 10%, 96%, 2.60, 0.94 (thorax) and 67%, 93%, 9.56, 0.36 (abdomen/pelvis). CONCLUSION: Clinician judgement was most useful to guide need for CT imaging in the neck and abdomen/pelvis. Routine PBCT may not be necessary. SUMMARY: For awake, stable intoxicated patients after falls and assaults, clinician index of suspicion was most useful to guide the need for CT imaging in the neck and abdomen/pelvis. Our findings support selective use of CT if the index of suspicion is low. Routine PBCT may not be necessary."]}
{"question": "Is lumbar drainage of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid fistula after spine surgery effective?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: This study is a retrospective consecutive case series analysis of 198 patients who underwent spine surgery between 2009 and 2010. The aim of this paper was to assess the efficacy and safeness of bed rest and lumbar drainage in treating postoperative CSF fistula. Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula is a well-known complication in spine surgery which lead to a significant change in length of hospitalization and possible postoperative complications. Management of CSF leaks has changed little over the past 20 years with no golden standard advocated from literature. METHODS: Postoperative CSF fistulas were described in 16 of 198 patients (8%) who underwent spine surgery between 2009 and 2010. The choice of the therapeutic strategy was based on the clinical condition of the patients, taking into account the possibility to maintain the prone position continuously and the risk of morbidity due to prolonged bed rest. Six patients were treated conservatively (position prone for three weeks), ten patients were treated by positioning an external CSF lumbar drainage for ten days. The mean follow-up period was ten months. RESULTS: All patients healed their wound properly and no adverse events were recorded. Patients treated conservatively were cured in a mean period of 30 days, while patients treated with CSF drainage were cured in a mean period of 10 days. CONCLUSION: Lumbar drainage seems to be effective and safe both in preventing CSF fistula in cases of large dural tears and debilitated/irradiated patients and in treating CSF leaks.", "STUDY DESIGN: This case report illustrates the development of a cerebrospinal fluid fistula and pseudomeningocele in a patient after lumbar discectomy and fusion with instrumentation. OBJECTIVE: The patient is treated successfully with a combined treatment protocol of epidural blood patch and brief course of spinal drainage. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Many surgeons advocate a trial of cerebrospinal fluid diversion for postoperative cerebrospinal fluid fistula. This treatment may be problematic in patients with spinal implants because a trial of cerebrospinal fluid diversion may not obliterate the extradural anatomic dead space that is created by instrumentation procedures and increases the rist of infection. A few case reports indicate that epidural blood patch also may be an effective management technique. A combined treatment protocol that may offer some advantages to either treatment alone is described METHODS: The patient was brought to the radiology department, and a lumbar spinal drain was placed at the L2-L3 interspace under fluoroscopic guidance with the patient in the prone position. A Tuohy needle was inserted into the pseudomeningocele, and the collection was drained. Thirty milliters of blood drawn from an antecubital vein was injected into the epidural space over the laminectomy site. Spinal drainage was continued for 4 days. RESULTS: The treatment protocol resulted in resolution of cerebrospinal fluid leakage in the patient. This result was confirmed by myelogram. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative pseudomeningocele and cerebrospinal fluid fistula in patients with spinal instrumentation can be treated successfully with epidural blood patch and a brief course (4 days) of spinal drainage. This combined treatment protocol may have some advantages to treatment with 7 days of cerebrospinal fluid diversion or to percutaneous epidural blood patch alone.", "One hundred and seven patients who had a lumbar subarachnoid catheter (teflon or silicone) placed for closed continuous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage between 1983-1991 are presented. Overall, the drain was successful in achieving the desired goal in 101 of 107 (94%) cases. There were no deaths. Five of 107 (5%) patients developed infections including two cases (2%) of meningitis. There were three cases (3%) of overdrainage with temporary neurologic decline, but all recovered. Five of fifteen (33%) teflon catheters required replacement because of occlusion, but only 5 of 92 (5%) silicone catheters required replacement. Transient lumbar nerve root irritation was seen in 15 of 107 (14%) patients treated for a CSF fistula, and all symptoms resolved after drain removal. CSF fistula/pseudomeningocele after spine surgery was cured by CSF drainage in 36 of 39 (92%) cases; there was a 10% incidence of infection (1 wound, 2 discitis, 1 meningitis). CSF fistula after cranial surgery was cured in 22 of 25 (87%) cases; there was 1 case of (4%) infection and 1 case (4%) of overdrainage. A drain was used to augment a tenuous dural closure in 38 patients with 100% success; no infection occurred and there were 2 cases (5%) of overdrainage. Five patients were successfully treated for traumatic CSF rhinorrhea/otorrhea without complications. The silicone catheter appears superior to the teflon catheter; however, both are simple, safe, and efficacious for the treatment or prevention of CSF fistulas.", "A retrospective review was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of a temporary subarachnoid shunt to treat patients who have a leak of cerebrospinal fluid after a spinal operation. The shunt is percutaneously inserted in the lumbar spine and is removed after four days. This technique was used in nineteen patients over a ten-year period. Of the seventeen patients who had the shunt in place for the full four days, fourteen had resolution of the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid from the wound. One of two patients whose shunt was removed early also had a successful result. Eleven of the fifteen patients who were successfully treated were available for follow-up, and none had any adverse effects related to the original cerebrospinal-fluid leak or its treatment. The four patients who had a persistent leak were successfully treated with reoperation and direct repair of the dura. Eleven (58 per cent) of the nineteen patients had transient complaints of nausea and vomiting while being treated with subarachnoid drainage. Two of the nineteen patients had evidence of an intradural infection after placement of the catheter; the infection resolved in both patients after removal of the catheter and treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Closed subarachnoid drainage, when properly performed and monitored, is a reasonably effective and safe method for treating dural-cutaneous cerebrospinal-fluid leaks after a spinal operation. It may be considered as a non-operative alternative to the standard procedure of reoperation and direct repair of the dura. A good result is still possible in patients in whom this technique fails and who eventually need surgical management.", "BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fistulas and pseudomeningoceles can occur after lumbar spinal surgery, and are sometimes refractory to direct repair, external drainage, and blood patches. The authors report a technique for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion from the lumbar spine to the peritoneum to assist with the management of these difficult situations. METHODS: Using video-laparoscopic assistance, two shunts are placed from the lumbar region into the peritoneal cavity: first, a lumbar subarachnoid space to peritoneum shunt; and second, a meningocele cavity to peritoneum shunt. Patients are ambulated immediately after the procedure. External drains are not used. RESULTS: Four patients with refractory CSF leaks were successfully managed with this technique. Complications associated with prolonged bedrest and external drains were avoided. Ancillary procedures were minimized, and hospital stay was shortened. Laparoscopic assistance offered verification of accurate placement of the peritoneal catheter and shortened operative times. CONCLUSIONS: Dual lumbar peritoneal shunts (intrathecal-peritoneal and meningocele cavity-peritoneal), placed with laparoscopic assistance, proved effective in the management of four patients with postoperative lumbar CSF leaks, who had failed to respond to conventional treatment."]}
{"question": "Is obesity a risk factor for wheezing among adolescents?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of obesity at the start of adolescence on the prevalence, incidence and maintenance of chest wheezing among individuals aged 11-15 years in a birth cohort in a developing country. METHODS: The seventh follow-up of the 1993 Pelotas birth cohort occurred in 2004 (individuals aged 10-11 years). Between January and August 2008, the eighth follow-up of the cohort was conducted. All the individuals of the original cohort who were alive (who were then adolescents aged between 14 and 15 years) were targets for the study. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was used to define wheezing. In addition to the body mass index (BMI), used to define obesity by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, we assessed skinfold thickness. RESULTS: From the original cohort, 4,349 individuals were located (85.7% follow-up rate). The prevalence of chest wheezing at 11 and 15 years were 13.5% (95% CI: 12.5%-14.5%) and 12.1% (95% CI: 11.1%-13.1%), respectively. The prevalence of wheezing at both times was 4.5% (95% CI: 3.9%-5.1%) and the incidence of wheezing was 7.5% (95% CI: 6.7%-8.3%). Independent of the effect of various confounding variables, the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was 50% greater among obese individuals than among eutrophic individuals at 11 years (RR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.14-2.05). The greater the skinfold tertile at 11 years, the higher the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was (p = .011). Weight status and skinfolds did not present any association with incident wheezing. After controlling for confounding factors, the risk of persistent wheezing among obese individuals at 11 years was 1.82 (95% CI: 1.30-2.54). CONCLUSIONS: Since obesity at the start of adolescence is associated with asthma symptom persistence, prevention and treatment of obesity may reduce avoidable healthcare costs and disease burden.", "BACKGROUND: Although several mechanisms underlying the asthma-obesity connection have been proposed, debates still remain. This study was to determine whether overweight is associated with a higher prevalence of atopy, asthma symptoms, airway obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) or biomarkers of inflammation in a sample of Korean adolescents. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey involving questionnaires, skin tests, spirometry and methacholine challenge tests among 717 adolescents from Seoul (South Korea). Overweight status was defined as a BMI greater than the local age- and gender-specific 85th percentile. RESULTS: Overweight subjects more frequently reported ever having wheezing (24.6 vs. 14.0%, p = 0.001) and wheezing in the previous 12 months (11.5 vs. 6.3%, p = 0.02) than normal-weight subjects, especially in boys. Atopy was more common among overweight adolescents than among those of normal weight (61.5 vs. 49.2%, p = 0.002), especially in boys (65.0 vs. 52.8%, p = 0.005). Overweight subjects had higher total WBC counts and eosinophil counts, especially boys. The presence of BHR was more common only among overweight girls (32.8 vs. 18.0%, p = 0.028). Overweight status was a significant risk factor for the presence of atopy (odds ratio = 1.49; 95% CI 1.06-2.10), after adjusting for various confounders by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between overweight status and both atopy and an increased prevalence of wheezing in adolescent Korean boys. These findings suggest that being overweight in puberty may be one of several risk factors responsible for atopy, BHR, and asthma symptoms.", "BACKGROUND: Many asthma studies are available in the literature, but few investigated whether risk factors for asthma differ by sex. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk factors for wheezing in early adolescence, with emphasis on sex differences. METHODS: A prospective birth cohort study was initiated in 1993; 87.5% of the original cohort was traced at 11 years, totaling 4,452 adolescents. Current wheezing was defined as at least 1 crisis in the previous 12 months. The following independent variables were analyzed: maternal smoking during pregnancy, wheezing at 4 years, maternal wheezing, and adolescent body mass index. RESULTS: Current wheezing affected 13.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.4%-14.5%) of the cohort. The prevalence of current wheezing was 15.3% (95% CI, 13.7%-16.8%) in boys and 11.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-13.1%) in girls (P < .001). Maternal smoking was related to an increased risk of wheezing for boys but not for girls. There was a significant tracking of wheezing from 4 to 11 years in both sexes, although the magnitude was stronger for boys. A dose-response association between maternal wheezing and adolescent wheezing was observed in boys but not in girls. Finally, obesity was associated with an increased risk of wheezing in boys but not in girls. CONCLUSIONS: The variables explored in this investigation had a stronger effect on adolescent wheezing in boys than in girls. Public health strategies aimed at minimizing the burden of wheezing should take these sex differences into account.", "BACKGROUND: Some studies indicate some causal relationship between obesity and asthma, while others show inconsistent results. Our objective was to evaluate the prevalence of asthma according to obesity in children. METHODS: A cross-sectional study, following the ISAAC study methodology, was conducted on two randomly selected groups consisting of 6-7 year-old children (n=7485) and 13-14 year-old adolescents (n=8496). The asthma symptoms and potential risk factors were determined from the questionnaire. Overweight and obesity were defined based on the body mass index. Multiple logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted prevalence odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Obesity was associated with an increase in wheezing ever (OR: 1.35) and exercise-induced asthma (OR: 1.62) in the 6-7 year-old group. No significant relationship was observed in the adolescent population. CONCLUSION: Obesity was associated with a higher prevalence of asthma in young children, but not in adolescents.", "BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to assess whether the recent increases in prevalence of both asthma and obesity are linked and to determine if obesity is a risk factor for diagnosed asthma, symptoms, use of asthma medication, or airway hyperresponsiveness. METHODS: Data from 1971 white adults aged 17-73 years from three large epidemiological studies performed in NSW were pooled. Doctor diagnosis of asthma ever, history of wheeze, and medication use in the previous 12 months were obtained by questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI) in kg/m(2) was used as a measure of obesity. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was defined as dose of <3.9 micromol histamine required to provoke a fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) of 20% or more (PD(20)FEV(1)). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were obtained by logistic regression. RESULTS: After adjusting for atopy, age, sex, smoking history, and family history, severe obesity was a significant risk factor for recent asthma (OR 2. 04, p=0.048), wheeze in the previous 12 months (OR 2.6, p=0.001), and medication use in the previous 12 months (OR 2.83, p=0.005), but not for AHR (OR 0.87, p=0.78). FEV(1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were significantly reduced in the group with severe obesity, but FEV(1)/FVC ratio, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and mid forced expiratory flow (FEF(25-75)) were not different from the group with normal BMI. The underweight group (BMI <18.5 kg/m(2)) had increased symptoms of shortness of breath, increased airway responsiveness, and reduced FEV(1), FVC, PEF, and FEF(25-75) with similar use of asthma medication as subjects in the normal weight range. CONCLUSIONS: Although subjects with severe obesity reported more wheeze and shortness of breath which may suggest a diagnosis of asthma, their levels of atopy, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway obstruction did not support the suggestion of a higher prevalence of asthma in this group. The underweight group appears to have more significant respiratory problems with a higher prevalence of symptoms, reduced lung function, and increased airway responsiveness without an increase in medication usage. This group needs further investigation."]}
{"question": "Dose end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement correlate with arterial carbon dioxide in extremely low birth weight infants in the first week of life?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation and agreement between end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) in ventilated extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants in the first week of life. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all ELBW (<1,000 g) infants admitted to a level III NICU from January 2003 to December 2003. Data collected included demographic details and simultaneous EtCO(2) (mainstream capnography) and arterial blood gas values (pH, PaCO(2), PaO(2)). OUTCOME: The correlation coefficient, degree of bias with 95% confidence interval between the EtCO(2) and PaCO(2). RESULTS: There were 754 end-tidal and arterial CO(2) pairs from 31 ELBW infants (21 male and 10 female). The overall EtCO(2) values were significantly lower than PaCO(2) value. In only 89/754(11.8%) pairs, the EtCO(2) was higher than the PaCO(2). The overall bias was 5.6 +/- 6.9 mmHg (95% C.I. 5.11-6.09). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.81. Using EtCO2 ranges of 30 to 50 mmHg, the capnographic method was able to identify 84% of instances where PaCO(2) was between 35 (<35 = hypocarbia) and 55 mmHg (>55= hypercapnia). CONCLUSIONS: There is good correlation and agreement between end-tidal CO(2) and arterial CO(2) in ELBW infants in the EtCO(2) range 30-50 mmHg. End-tidal CO(2) monitoring can be helpful in trending or for screening abnormal PaCO(2) values in ELBW infants in first week of life."]}
{"question": "Is CA72-4 a useful biomarker in differential diagnosis between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Surgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve. A correct diagnosis in cases not scheduled for surgery is therefore mandatory in order to avoid unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis. Endometriosis is often associated with high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to establish if the serum marker CA72-4 could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer. METHODS: Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. RESULTS: High CA125 concentrations were observed in patients with ovarian endometriosis and in those with ovarian cancer. A marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian cancer (71.0%) and patients with endometriosis (13.8%) (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that CA72-4 determination can be useful to confirm the benign nature of ovarian endometriomas in women with high CA125 levels.", "BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is frequently associated with high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to establish a panel of complementary biomarkers that could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis or other ovarian benign masses and ovarian cancer. METHODS: Blood samples from 50 healthy women, 17 patients with benign ovarian tumors, 57 patients with ovarian endometrioma and 39 patients with ovarian cancer were analyzed and serum values were measured for the following biomarkers: CA125, HE4 and CA72-4. RESULTS: Serum CA125 concentration was elevated in both patients with ovarian endometriosis and ovarian cancer but not in patients with other benign ovarian masses. HE4 was never increased in patients with endometriosis or benign masses whereas it was significantly higher in all patients with ovarian cancer (p < 0.05). A marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian cancer (67%) and those with endometriosis (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study suggest that HE4 and CA72-4 determination is the best approach to confirm the benign nature of ovarian endometrioma in women with high CA125 levels."]}
{"question": "Does increased nerve length within the treatment volume improve trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that increasing the nerve length within the treatment volume for trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery would improve pain relief. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-seven patients with typical trigeminal neuralgia were randomized to undergo retrogasserian gamma knife radiosurgery (75 Gy maximal dose with 4-mm diameter collimators) using either one (n = 44) or two (n = 43) isocenters. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 1-36). RESULTS: Pain relief was complete in 57 patients (45 without medication and 12 with low-dose medication), partial in 15, and minimal in another 15 patients. The actuarial rate of obtaining complete pain relief (with or without medication) was 67.7% +/- 5.1%. The pain relief was identical for one- and two-isocenter radiosurgery. Pain relapsed in 30 of 72 responding patients. Facial numbness and mild and severe paresthesias developed in 8, 5, and 1 two-isocenter patients vs. 3, 4, and 0 one-isocenter patients, respectively (p = 0.23). Improved pain relief correlated with younger age (p = 0.025) and fewer prior procedures (p = 0.039) and complications (numbness or paresthesias) correlated with the nerve length irradiated (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the treatment volume to include a longer nerve length for trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery does not significantly improve pain relief but may increase complications.", "AIM: To analyze the effect of different radiation variables on the outcomes of treatment for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients with refractory TN were treated with a maximum dose of 75-90 Gy using either one (n = 41) or two (n = 32) isocenters and were intensively followed up. The integrated dose delivered to the trigeminal nerve root within the prepontine cistern and the nerve root volume was calculated using the Gamma-Plan system. Relationships between the clinical outcomes and radiation variables were statistically analyzed using a combination of Fisher's exact test and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: At their last follow up, 21 patients (28.8%), 22 patients (30.1%), 19 patients (26%), 6 patients (8.2%), and 5 patients (6.8%) had Grade I-V pain outcomes, respectively, and the average mean dose delivered to the trigeminal nerve root, average integrated dose (mJ) and nerve root volume in prepontine cistern were 45.29 Gy, 4,26 mJ, and 98.47 mm 3 , respectively. The pain relief rate was not significantly improved by a higher amount of integrated dose received by the trigeminal nerve root in prepontine cistern, however, incidence of trigeminal nerve toxicity was increased (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our limited results suggested that a higher integrated dose might increase the incidence of trigeminal nerve toxicity with no significant benefits in pain relief when the maximal doses were within 75-90 Gy. The protocol for increasing radiation variables such as longer nerve exposure length and higher maximal dose is not recommended as a routine approach and more randomized studies with large number of cases would be required to verify the best treatment strategy of gamma knife radiosurgery for TN."]}
{"question": "Is the affinity column-mediated immunoassay method suitable as an alternative to the microparticle enzyme immunoassay method as a blood tacrolimus assay?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressive drug used in organ transplantation. Because of its substantial toxic effects, narrow therapeutic index, and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability, therapeutic drug monitoring of whole-blood tacrolimus concentrations has been recommended. We investigated the comparability of the results of 2 immunoassay systems, affinity column-mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) and microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA), comparing differences in the tacrolimus concentrations measured by the 2 methods in relation to the hematologic and biochemical values of hepatic and renal functions. METHODS: A total of 154 samples from kidney or liver transplant recipients were subjected to Dimension RxL HM with a tacrolimus Flex reagent cartilage for the ACMIA method and IMx tacrolimus II for the MEIA method. RESULTS: Tacrolimus concentrations measured by the ACMIA method (n = 154) closely correlated with those measured by the MEIA method (r = 0.84). The Bland-Altman plot using concentration differences between the 2 methods and the average of the 2 methods showed no specific trends. The tacrolimus levels determined by both the MEIA method and the ACMIA method were not influenced by hematocrit levels, but the difference between the 2 methods (ACMIA - MEIA) tended to be larger in low hematocrit samples (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The ACMIA method used for a tacrolimus assay is precise and has advantages, including the lack of a required pretreatment procedure. Furthermore, it is only slightly influenced by the hematologic or biochemical status of the samples."]}
{"question": "Should tumor depth be included in prognostication of soft tissue sarcoma?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Most staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma are based on histologic malignancy-grade, tumor size and tumor depth. These factors are generally dichotomized, size at 5 cm. We believe it is unlikely that tumor depth per se should influence a tumor's metastatic capability. Therefore we hypothesized that the unfavourable prognostic importance of depth could be explained by the close association between size and depth, deep-seated tumors on average being larger than the superficial ones. When tumor size is dichotomized, this effect should be most pronounced in the large size (>5 cm) group in which the size span is larger. METHODS: We analyzed the associations between tumor size and depth and the prognostic importance of grade, size and depth in a population-based series of 490 adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk wall with complete, 4.5 years minimum, follow-up. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed no major prognostic effect of tumor depth when grade and size were taken into account. The mean size of small tumors was the same whether superficial or deep but the mean size of large and deep-seated tumors were one third larger than that of large but superficial tumors. Tumor depth influenced the prognosis in the subset of high-grade and large tumors. In this subset deep-seated tumors had poorer survival rate than superficial tumors, which could be explained by the larger mean size of the deep-seated tumors. CONCLUSION: Most of the prognostic value of tumor depth in soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity or trunk wall can be explained by the association between tumor size and depth.", "BACKGROUND: The updated 8th version of the AJCC-staging system for soft tissue sarcomas (STS) has been criticised for omitting tumour depth as category-defining variable and eventually not improving prognostic accuracy in comparison to the 7th version. This study aimed at investigating the prognostic accuracy of both AJCC-versions in STS-patients treated at European tertiary sarcoma centres. METHODS: 1032 patients (mean age: 60.7 +/- 16.3 years; 46.0% [n = 475] females; median follow-up: 38.6 months), treated at five tertiary sarcoma centres for localised, intermediate or high-grade STS of extremities and trunk were retrospectively included. Uni- and multivariate Cox-regression models and Harrell's C-indices were calculated to analyse prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and assess prognostic accuracy. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, prognostic accuracy for OS was comparable for both AJCC-versions (C-index: 0.620 [8th] vs. 0.614 [7th]). By adding margins, age, gender, and histology to the multivariate models, prognostic accuracy of both versions could be likewise improved (C-index: 0.714 [8th] vs. 0.705 [7th]). Moreover, tumour depth did not significantly contribute to prognostic accuracy of the 8th version's multivariate model (C-index for both models: 0.714). Stratification into four main T-stages based on tumour size only, as implemented in the 8th version, significantly improved prognostic accuracy between each category. However, T-stages as defined in the 7th version had poorer discriminatory power (C-index: 0.625 [8th] vs. 0.582 [7th]). CONCLUSION: Both AJCC-versions perform equally well regarding prognostic accuracy. Yet, simplification of the 8 (th) version by omitting tumour depth as T-stage-defining parameter, whilst emphasizing the importance of tumour size, should be considered advantageous.", "Background: The AJCC recently published the 8th edition of its cancer staging system. Significant changes were made to the staging algorithm for soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of the extremities or trunk, including the addition of 2 additional T (size) classifications in lieu of tumor depth and grouping lymph node metastasis (LNM) with distant metastasis as stage IV disease. Whether these changes improve staging system performance is questionable. Patients and Methods: This retrospective cohort analysis of 21,396 adult patients with STS of the extremity or trunk in the SEER database compares the AJCC 8th edition staging system with the 7th edition and a newly proposed staging algorithm using a variety of statistical techniques. The effect of tumor size on disease-specific survival was assessed by flexible, nonlinear Cox proportional hazard regression using restricted cubic splines and fractional polynomials. Results: The slope of covariate-adjusted log hazards for sarcoma-specific survival decreases for tumors >8 cm in greatest dimension, limiting prognostic information contributed by the new T4 classification in the AJCC 8th edition. Anatomic depth independently provides significant prognostic information. LNM is not equivalent to distant, non-nodal metastasis. Based on these findings, an alternative staging system is proposed and demonstrated to outperform both AJCC staging schemes. The analyses presented also disclose no evidence of improved clinical performance of the 8th edition compared with the previous edition. Conclusions: The AJCC 8th edition staging system for STS is no better than the previous 7th edition. Instead, a proposed staging system based on histologic grade, tumor size, and anatomic depth shows significantly higher predictive accuracy, with higher model concordance than either AJCC staging system. Changes to existing staging systems should improve the performance of prognostic models. Until such improvements are documented, AJCC committees should refrain from modifying established staging schemes.", "BACKGROUND: Staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are important to identify patients with similar systemic risk who might benefit from specific treatments. This study compared four commonly used staging systems for predicting systemic outcomes of patients with localized extremity STS, as proposed by the fourth and fifth editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer (AJCC/UICC) staging system, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) system, and the Surgical Staging System (SSS) of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society. METHODS: Three hundred consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic STS of the lower extremity were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1982 and 1989. Metastasis free survival was the end point of the study. The prognostic value of the four staging systems and their components were examined in univariate and multivariate analyses. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to identify the system that best predicted the risk of systemic recurrence. RESULTS: Compartment status, depth, grade, and size were all independent predictors of outcome within their respective staging systems. However, when compared with one another, only depth, grade, and size retained their prognostic significance. Of the four models, the AIC predicted that the MSK was the best predictor of systemic relapse, followed by the fifth edition of the AJCC/UICC staging system. CONCLUSIONS: Staging systems such as the MSK system or the fifth edition of the AJCC/UICC system, which include tumor depth, grade, and size as prognostic factors, are the most predictive of systemic relapse in patients presenting with localized extremity STS. Both of these systems identify the same group of patients at the highest risk who would be the most suitable for adjuvant chemotherapy trials.", "High grade soft tissue sarcomas often show histological invasion to adjacent compartment including bone and vessel. This study aimed to evaluate histological invasion in high grade soft tissue sarcomas, clarify its impact on prognosis and devise treatment strategies. We retrospectively reviewed 133 patients with non-small round cell high grade soft tissue sarcomas surgically treated between 2001 and 2011. Clinical and histological factors examined for prognostic value included age, gender, size, depth, location, adjuvant therapy and invasion to adjacent compartment. Study endpoints included overall survival rate, event free survival rate and local recurrence free survival rate, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. Local recurrence was recognized in 14 cases (11%). The 5-year overall survival rate and 5-year event free survival rate were 82.2% and 63.6% respectively. The metastasis-free survival rate at 5 years and local recurrence-free survival rate at 5 years were 69.8% and 86.8% respectively. Histological invasion to adjacent compartment was noted in 52 cases (39%), and was significantly correlated with histological type (p = 0.01), tumor size (p = 0.009), and depth (p < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, we showed that tumor size and histological invasion were significant independent predictors of OS (hazard ratio 8.1/2.5) and EFS (hazard ratio 5.5/2.2), while only tumor size was a significant independent predictor of LRFS (hazard ratio 4.0). We evaluated the relation between histological invasion and the oncological outcomes of high grade soft tissue sarcomas. In multivariate analyses, histological invasion was found to be an independent adverse prognostic factor with hazard ratios of 2.2-2.5, suggesting that a detailed assessment of these factors is essential. Histological invasion showed a correlation with tumor size and histological type, and the surgical margin should be decided based on these factors."]}
{"question": "Is amoxapine an atypical antipsychotic?", "retrieved_passages": ["Amoxapine is marketed as an antidepressant. However, its in-vitro profile, receptor occupancy and preclinical effects are very similar to atypical antipsychotics. Amoxapine has also shown efficacy as an atypical antipsychotic in open trials. The objective of this study was to compare the antipsychotic and side effect profile of amoxapine and risperidone in a randomised assignment, standardized dosing, double-blind trial of acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia. A total of 48 schizophrenic patients were enrolled and randomized in a double-blind 6-week trial to receive either risperidone (up to 5 mg/day) or amoxapine (up to 250 mg/day). Positive, negative, affective symptoms and motor side effects were measured using standardized weekly assessments. Prolactin levels were also determined at baseline and at the end of the study. A total of 39 patients (amoxapine, n=22; risperidone, n=21) completed the trial. Both pharmacological treatments, amoxapine 228.0 mg/day (SD=34.6) and risperidone 4.5 mg/day (SD=0.7), showed equivalent improvement in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms. Amoxapine was associated with less EPS and less prolactin elevation than risperidone. These data support previous reports about the efficacy of amoxapine as an atypical antipsychotic. Since amoxapine is off-patent, it may be a valuable low-cost alternative to new atypical antipsychotics, particularly in low-income countries where the majority of the patients are still treated with typical antipsychotics.", "OBJECTIVE: Amoxapine is marketed as an antidepressant. However, its receptor occupancy, in vitro and in vivo, and its effects in pre-clinical models are very similar to atypical antipsychotics. To examine if this leads to an atypical antipsychotic effect in the clinical context, the authors examined the antipsychotic and side-effect profile of amoxapine in acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Seventeen patients were enrolled and 15 completed a prospective open-label 6-week study of amoxapine starting with a fixed-starting dose (150 mg/h) with standardized titration up to 250 mg/h, if required. Positive, negative, affective symptoms and side-effects were monitored using standardized weekly assessments. RESULTS: Amoxapine (median final dose 210 mg/h) was well-tolerated and showed significant improvement in positive and negative symptoms (both p<0.001), with a trend towards improvement in mood symptoms and no treatment-emergent extrapyramidal side-effects, akathisia or weight gain. Prolactin elevation was observed. CONCLUSION: These clinical data lend support to the pre-clinical suggestions that amoxapine may be an atypical antipsychotic. Given its lack of weight gain and that it is considerably less expensive than current options, amoxapine could be a valuable alternative for some patients. These considerations strongly call for more systematic, double-blind studies of amoxapine as an atypical antipsychotic.", "Amoxapine, a dibenzoxazepine antidepressant, has been suggested to have atypical antipsychotic properties. We tested it to control psychosis in three patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Two patients had significant improvement in hallucinations, whereas the third could not tolerate the drug for a sufficient period. All three patients experienced a decline in motor function; two also had concomitant reduction in dyskinesias. Therefore, although we found some support for amoxapine having antipsychotic properties, this drug seems to carry a risk of worsening motor function in patients with PD.", "It has been proposed that the lack of extrapyramidal side effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs is caused by their fast dissociation or low affinity for the D2 receptor or their concomitant high affinity for other receptors, for example, 5HT2 and D4. We noted that amoxapine, an established antidepressant, has affinity for 5HT2 and D2 receptors, and its effects in preclinical model are very similar to atypical antipsychotics. The objective of this study was to examine the antipsychotic effect and side effect profile of amoxapine versus haloperidol in a double-blind study for 6 weeks in patients with schizophrenia. A total of 54 patients with schizophrenia were titrated to the starting dose of 150 mg/d of amoxapine or 5 mg/d of haloperidol within 3 days. Clinical efficacy and side effects were monitored at baseline, and Weeks 2, 4, and 6.Forty-one patients completed 5 weeks, and 36 patients completed the 6 weeks of follow-up. Both treatment groups showed significant improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive (30%) and total scores (20%), without significant differences between the groups. In addition, in the amoxapine group, significant improvement was seen in the negative symptoms and the Clinical Global Impression. No significant changes were seen on Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, side effect checklists, and prolactin levels in both groups. The results suggest that amoxapine may be as effective an antipsychotic as haloperidol as predicted by its affinity for D2 and 5HT2 receptors, supporting earlier studies. However, it did not prove to have fewer extrapyramidal side effects than haloperidol, possibly because the baseline scores were very low.", "BACKGROUND: All currently available atypical antipsychotics have, at clinically relevant doses: i) high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy; ii) greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy; and iii) a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when their D2 occupancy exceeds 80%. A review of pharmacologic and behavioral data suggested that amoxapine should also conform to this profile; therefore, we undertook a positron-emission tomography (PET) study of its 5-HT2 and D2 occupancy. METHODS: Seven healthy volunteers received 50-250 mg/day of amoxapine for 5 days and then had [11C]-raclopride and [18F]-setoperone PET scans. RESULTS: 5-HT2 receptors showed near saturation at doses of 100 mg/day and above. The D2 receptor occupancies showed a dose-dependent increase, never exceeding 80%; at all doses 5-HT2 occupancy exceeded D2 occupancy. CONCLUSIONS: PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia."]}
{"question": "Is non-HDL-cholesterol a better predictor of long-term outcome in patients after acute myocardial infarction compared to LDL-cholesterol?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: It has recently been shown that non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) may be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Based on known ethic differences in lipid parameters and cardiovascular risk prediction, we sought to study the predictability of attaining non-HDL-C target and long-term major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in Thai patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) compared to attaining LDL-C target. METHODS: We retrospectively obtained the data of all patients who were admitted at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital due to AMI during 2006-2013. The mean non-HDL-C and LDL-C during long-term follow-up were used to predict MACE at each time point. The patients were classified as target attainment if non-HDL-C <100 mg/dl and/or LDL-C <70 mg/dl. The MACE was defined as combination of all-cause death, nonfatal coronary event and nonfatal stroke. RESULTS: During mean follow-up of 2.6 +/- 1.6 years among 868 patients after AMI, 34.4% achieved non-HDL-C target, 23.7% achieved LDL-C target and 21.2% experienced MACEs. LDL-C and non-HDL-C were directly compared in Cox regression model. Compared with non-HDL-C <100 mg/dl, patients with non-HDL-C of >130 mg/dl had higher incidence of MACEs (HR 3.15, 95% CI 1.46-6.80, P = 0.003). Surprisingly, LDL-C >100 mg/dl was associated with reduced risk of MACE as compared to LDL <70 mg/dl (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.98, p = 0.046) after direct pairwise comparison with non-HDL-C level. CONCLUSIONS: Non-attaining non-HDL-C goal predicted MACE at long-term follow-up after AMI whereas non-attaining LDL-C goal was not associated with the higher risk. Therefore, non-HDL-C may be a more suitable target of dyslipidemia treatment than LDL-C in patients after AMI."]}
{"question": "The association of puberty and young adolescent alcohol use: do parents have a moderating role?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To explore the extent to which parent-adolescent emotional closeness, family conflict, and parental permissiveness moderate the association of puberty and alcohol use in adolescents (aged 10-14). METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 7631 adolescents from 231 Australian schools. Measures included pubertal status, recent (30day) alcohol use, parent-adolescent emotional closeness, family conflict, parental permissiveness of alcohol use and peer alcohol use. The analysis was based on a two-level (individuals nested within schools) logistic regression model, with main effects entered first, and interaction terms added second. RESULTS: The interaction of family factors and pubertal stage did not improve the fit of the model, so a main effect model of family factors and pubertal stage was adopted. There were significant main effects for pubertal stage with boys in middle puberty at increased odds of alcohol use, and girls in advanced puberty at increased odds of alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS: Puberty and family factors were strong predictors of adolescent alcohol use, but family factors did not account for variation in the association of pubertal stage and alcohol use."]}
{"question": "Does body mass index (BMI) influence morbidity and long-term survival in gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy?", "retrieved_passages": ["Radical gastrectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer causes serious nutritional impairment. Our study evaluated the clinical impact of body mass index (BMI) on the long-term outcomes of advanced gastric cancer (stage II and III). We analyzed 211 cases of stage II and III gastric cancer between January 2005 and December 2010 at Chung-Ang University Hospital, Seoul, Korea. Patients were divided into four groups according to BMI: underweight, normal, overweight, and obese. In addition, we divided patients into two groups: BMI-High (BMI >/= 23 kg/m(2)) vs. BMI-Low (BMI < 23 kg/m(2)). We assessed age, sex, tumor location, lymph node (LN) involvement, operation method, initial cancer stage, recurrence, and survival between the two groups. There was significant difference in overall survival (OS) between the underweight group and the other groups (P = 0.005). The survival of the BMI-High group was better than that of the BMI-Low group. The rate of cancer-related death in the BMI-High group was significantly lower than that in the BMI-Low group (cancer-related death: BMI-Low 27% vs. BMI-High 12.6%, P = 0.022). Our findings suggest that preoperative BMI may have an influence on the long-term outcomes of advanced gastric cancer after radical surgery and chemotherapy.", "BACKGROUND/AIMS: The long-term survival of patients with gastric cancer is governed by various factors, such as the clinical stage of the cancer, the patient's nutritional state, and the treatment and may be governed by the volume of intraperitoneal adipose tissue. The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship between the degree of the patients' body mass index and their long-term survival. METHODOLOGY: Gastric cancer patients who had undergone a gastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy and with resection A and B according to the criteria of the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer Rules were subgrouped into those patients with a body mass index < 0.185 (the lower body mass index group) and those patients with a body mass index > 0.210 (the higher body mass index group). The patient's morbidity and long-term survival rate was retrospectively compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: A significantly longer mean survival rate was observed for the lower body mass index group in stage 2 (1667 vs. 1322 days, P = 0.0240). Also, a significantly longer mean survival rate was observed for the higher BMI group in stage 3a (1431 vs. 943, P = 0.0071). CONCLUSIONS: The body mass index is one of the prognostic factors of stage 2 and stage 3a gastric cancer. However, it does not appear to be useful for determining the prognosis of stage 1a, 1b, 3b, and 4a gastric cancers.", "HYPOTHESIS: Overweight (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], > or =25.0) has an effect on surgical results, postoperative complications, and long-term survival in patients with gastric cancer who underwent curative gastrectomy. DESIGN: Retrospective study from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2002. SETTING: Wakayama Medical University Hospital. PATIENTS: This study included 689 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy (R0). Patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy, gastrectomy with pancreaticoduodenectomy, gastrectomy with another organ resection (liver, colon, or ovary), or gastrectomy with thoracotomy were not included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Duration of operation, amount of blood loss, incidence of postoperative complications, and survival analysis. RESULTS: The mean (SD) duration of the operation was longer in the overweight group (315 [75] minutes) than in the normal-weight group (277 [85] minutes) (P < .001). The mean (SD) intraoperative blood loss was larger in the overweight group (882 [764] mL) than in the normal-weight group (536 [410] mL) (P < .001). The rates of postoperative complications (anastomotic leakage, pancreatic fistula, and intra-abdominal abscess) were significantly higher in the overweight group (P < .05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that postoperative complications were significantly associated with being overweight (P = .01) and with undergoing pancreatectomy (P = .03). Disease-specific and overall survival did not show any significant difference between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Being overweight is not a poor risk factor for survival in patients with gastric cancer, although it is independently predictive of postoperative complications.", "BACKGROUND/AIM: A recent nationwide survey using the National Clinical Database in Japan identified a high proportion of low-weight patients, who are defined as low body mass index (BMI) patients, in comparison with Western countries. This study was designed to investigate the influence of low BMI on short- and long-term outcomes after curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 1,281 consecutive gastric cancer patients, who underwent curative gastrectomy with radical lymphadenectomy from 1997 through 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Low BMI and non-low BMI were defined as a BMI<18.5 and BMI>18.5 kg/m(2), respectively. RESULTS: Compared to patients with BMI higher than 18.5, those with BMI<18.5 had a significantly shorter duration of surgery (p<0.001) and tended to have lower blood loss (p=0.058). There was no difference in preoperative serum albumin level (p=0.592) and the incidence in postoperative abdominal infection complications (p=0.925) between the two groups. Whereas, BMI<18.5 was significantly associated with female gender, anemia, deeper tumor depth and nodal metastasis. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the BMI<18.5 was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival [p=0.010, HR 1.6 (95%CI=1.32-2.30)]. Concerning recurrence, the cumulative incidence rate was significantly higher in patients with BMI<18.5 than those without (p=0.045). CONCLUSION: Low weight did not have adverse effects on short-term outcomes including postoperative complications. However, there was a negative prognostic impact of low BMI, suggesting the requirement of meticulous treatments and follow-up in these gastric cancer patients.", "PURPOSE: Despite the increasing prevalence of obesity and gastric diseases, the impact of obesity on short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer still remains unclear. METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive obese patients with body mass index (BMI)>/=30 kg/m(2), who underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, were compared with 76 non-obese patients with BMI<30 kg/m(2). Short- and long-term outcomes were analyzed in both groups. RESULTS: Obesity was associated with a longer operative time and a greater estimated blood loss. The rate of conversion to open distal gastrectomy was similar between the two groups. There were no 30-day postoperative deaths in either group. There was no significant difference in the overall number or severity of 30-day postoperative complications between the two groups. Regarding long-term survival outcomes, there was no statistical difference in overall (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) between the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that BMI did not influence prognosis. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy appears to be a safe and reasonable option for selected obese patients with gastric cancer and results in short- and long-term outcomes similar to those in non-obese patients."]}
{"question": "Ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria: are there different levels of risk for transition to psychosis?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: The ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria have been validated in a number of studies. However, it is not known whether particular UHR criteria (Attenuated Psychotic Symptoms (APS), Brief Limited Intermittent Psychotic Symptoms (BLIPS) or Trait vulnerability criteria), or combination of criteria, is associated with a higher risk of transition to psychosis. The current study investigated this issue over a 6-month follow-up period. We hypothesised that the risk of transition would increase in the following order: Trait alone<APS alone < APS+Trait<BLIPS. METHOD: Data on UHR intake criteria and transition to psychosis status at 6 months were analysed for UHR patients seen at the PACE clinic, Orygen Youth Health between January 2000 and November 2008. RESULTS: A total of 928 new referrals were accepted into the PACE clinic over this period of whom 817 (88%) had baseline information available for analysis. The percentage of subjects who presented with APS, Trait and BLIPS were 83%, 27% and 4%, respectively. When the two intermediate groups (APS alone and APS+Trait) were combined, there was evidence that the risk of transition increased in the order of Trait alone<APS<BLIPS (p=0.024, adjusted analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that UHR intake criteria predict transition over 6 months in the order of Trait alone<APS<BLIPS. The fact that BLIPS patients are at the highest risk of transition over the short term is consistent with the \"early\" versus \"late\" prodrome model. It also indicates that particular clinical attention may need to be paid to BLIPS patients, especially early in the course of treatment.", "AIM: The 'ultra-high-risk' criteria identify a clinical population at substantially increased risk for progressing to schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Although a number of clinical variables predictive of transition to psychotic disorder have been identified within this population, the predictive value of the level of distress associated with attenuated psychotic symptoms has not yet been examined. This was the aim of the present study. METHOD: The level of distress (0-100) associated with attenuated psychotic symptoms was recorded for 70 ultra-high-risk (UHR) patients using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State (CAARMS). Transition to psychosis was assessed over a 16-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Of the 70 UHR patients, 15 transitioned to psychosis (21.4%). Of the four CAARMS subscales measuring attenuated positive symptoms, Perceptual Abnormalities was rated as the most distressing. There were no differences in CAARMS scales rated as the most distressing between those who transitioned to psychosis and those who did not. There was also no association between higher levels of distress associated with attenuated psychotic symptoms and transition to psychosis. CONCLUSION: Although the findings require replication, they indicate that the degree of distress associated with attenuated psychotic symptoms should not be used as a criterion for enriching UHR samples for risk of frank psychotic disorder.", "BACKGROUND: The chance of transition to psychosis in patients at Ultra High Risk for developing psychosis (UHR) is 10-15%. The aim of present study was to investigate differences in baseline clinical symptomatology, general level of functioning (GAF-score) and genetic risk between UHR patients who did (UHR+T) or did not (UHR+NT) make a transition to psychosis. Sharpening UHR inclusion criteria may aid in improving prediction of transition to psychosis. METHOD: The study sample was taken from 285 patients who were examined within the Dutch Prediction of Psychosis Study (DUPS) at the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Out of 73 included UHR subjects, 18 made a transition to psychosis. Psychopathology was investigated with the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes, Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms and GAF-score. The follow-up period of the study was three years. RESULTS: The UHR+T group showed more social anhedonia and withdrawal, more bizarre thinking and a lower GAF score at baseline than the UHR+NT group. CONCLUSIONS: In agreement with the results of Cannon et al. [Cannon, T.D., Cadenhead, K., Cornblatt, B., Woods, S.W., Addington, J., Walker, E., Seidman, L.J., Perkins, D., Tsuang, M., McGlashan, T., Heinssen, R., 2008. Prediction of Psychosis in Youth at High Clinical Risk: A Multisite Longitudinal Study in North America. Arch. Gen. Psychiat. 65 (1) 28-37.], our study indicates that severity of specific symptoms at baseline is related to transition to psychosis in UHR subjects. These findings may contribute to a more accurate prediction of a first psychotic episode. Furthermore, symptoms that are increased at baseline in the UHR+T group could be a focus of cognitive behavioural therapy in the UHR period.", "This article reviews recent findings on predictors of conversion to psychosis among youth deemed at ultra high risk (UHR) based on the presence of subpsychotic-intensity symptoms or genetic risk for psychosis and a recent decline in functioning. Although transition rates differ between studies, the most well powered studies have observed rates of conversion to full psychosis in the 30-40% range over 2-3 years of follow-up. Across studies, severity of subthreshold positive symptoms, poorer social functioning, and genetic risk for schizophrenia appear to be consistent predictors of conversion to psychosis, with algorithms combining these indicators achieving positive predictive power > 80%. Nevertheless, a substantial fraction of UHR cases do not convert to psychosis. Recent work indicates that UHR cases who present with lower levels of negative symptoms and higher levels of social functioning are more likely to recover symptomatically and no longer meet criteria for an at-risk mental state. In general, it appears that about 1/3 of UHR cases convert to psychosis, about 1/3 do not convert but remain symptomatic and functionally impaired, and about 1/3 recover symptomatically and functionally. Continued efforts to detect early risk for psychosis are critical for informing early intervention and provide increasing promise of delaying or even preventing the onset of psychosis.", "INTRODUCTION: Several studies have identified ultra-high-risk criteria that may characterize an at-risk mental state and predict the transition of psychotic evolution. Personality traits may play a crucial role in this process. AIMS: The current study aims to: (a) explore the evolution of an initial diagnosis over 12 months; (b) assess differences in social and occupational functioning; (c) identify common (trans-diagnostic) personality traits of psychotic risk. METHODS: The sample includes 97 (44 males and 53 females) young adults. They completed an assessment that consists of socio-demographic data, the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale, the Early Recognition Inventory-retrospective assessment onset of schizophrenia, and the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5). According to the tests' assessment, the sample was divided into three different groups: Ultra-High Risk (UHR), At-Risk, and Not at risk. One year after the first evaluation, psychiatrists administered the QuickSCID-5 to verify the diagnostic trajectories of the sample. RESULTS: Overall, the most prevalent category diagnoses were anxiety/depression, personality disorders, and psychosis. Specifically, the most common diagnosis in the UHR group was psychosis. Moreover, in the UHR group, the social and occupational functioning score was the lowest. In terms of differences in PID-5 personality traits, the At-risk and UHR groups scored highest in detachment and disinhibition. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups for negative affectivity, antagonism, and psychoticism traits. CONCLUSION: Results obtained by the current study should be considered an attempt to better understand the diagnostic trajectories and trans-diagnostic personality traits in a group of young help-seekers, specifically in UHR. Findings highlight both the importance of diagnosis and personality traits evaluation to customize a specific intervention based on the level of psychotic risk. Clinical suggestions are reported."]}

{"question": "Does head positioning influence anterior chamber depth in pseudoexfoliation syndrome?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Phacodonesis can occur in pseudoexfoliation syndrome because of impaired zonular support. This study investigates whether the increased mobility of the lens influences anterior chamber depth in patients with pseudoexfoliation while assuming a prone position. METHODS: Central anterior chamber depth was measured in 39 patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation and elevated intraocular pressure. Patients were placed in a face-up position for 5 minutes, at which time anterior chamber depth and axial length were measured by A scan, and intraocular pressure was measured by Tonopen (Oculab, La Jolla, CA) in both eyes. The measurements were repeated on both eyes after 5 minutes in a face-down position. RESULTS: No significant differences in intraocular pressure or axial length between the prone and supine positions were found in either eye. Anterior chamber depth in eyes with pseudoexfoliation decreased from a mean of 3.08 mm in the supine position to a mean of 2.95 mm in the prone position, whereas mean anterior chamber depth in the fellow eyes decreased from 3.01 mm to 2.97 mm. The decrease in anterior chamber depth when facing down in the eyes with pseudoexfoliation was significantly greater than in the fellow eyes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation, the lens seems to be more mobile in the affected eye. This results in a shallower anterior chamber when the head is placed in a prone position. Whether this fact might potentially lead to transient pupillary block when engaging in activities such as facing down while reading warrants further study."]}
{"question": "Sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure; can it improve sternal stability?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Sternal instability with mediastinitis is a very serious complication after median sternotomy. Biomechanical studies have suggested superiority of rigid plate fixation over wire cerclage for sternal fixation. This study tests the hypothesis that sternal closure stability can be improved by adding plate fixation in a human cadaver model. METHODS: Midline sternotomy was performed in 18 human cadavers. Four sternal closure techniques were tested: (1) approximation with six interrupted steel wires; (2) approximation with six interrupted cables; (3) closure 1 (wires) or 2 (cables) reinforced with a transverse sternal plate at the sixth rib; (4) Closure using 4 sternal plates alone. Intrathoracic pressure was increased in all techniques while sternal separation was measured by three pairs of sonomicrometry crystals fixed at the upper, middle and lower parts of the sternum until 2.0 mm separation was detected. Differences in displacement pressures were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and Regression Coefficients. RESULTS: Intrathoracic pressure required to cause 2.0 mm separation increased significantly from 183.3 +/- 123.9 to 301.4 +/- 204.5 in wires/cables alone vs. wires/cables plus one plate respectively, and to 355.0 +/- 210.4 in the 4 plates group (p < 0.05). Regression Coefficients (95% CI) were 120 (47-194) and 142 (66-219) respectively for the plate groups. CONCLUSION: Transverse sternal plating with 1 or 4 plates significantly improves sternal stability closure in human cadaver model. Adding a single sternal plate to primary closure improves the strength of sternal closure with traditional wiring potentially reducing the risk of sternal dehiscence and could be considered in high risk patients.", "OBJECTIVE: Postoperative sternal wound complications are a significant problem in high-risk patients. In addition to closure with conventional wires, several systems involving rigid fixation with metal plates are currently available. The rapid sternal closure system (Talon) is approved for stabilization and fixation of the anterior chest wall. Anecdotal evidence suggests that use of the Talon may result in improved postoperative recovery. METHODS: Fifty-one cardiac surgical patients at higher risk for sternal wound complications were enrolled at two sites. Subjects were randomized to insertion of Talons (n = 28) or wires only (control, n = 23) for sternal closure. The primary endpoint was a comparison between study groups of the percent of baseline incentive spirometry volume through postoperative day 7. Secondary endpoints included other measures of quality of recovery, sternal wound infection, and nonunion. RESULTS: The percentage of preoperative incentive spirometry volume achieved was higher in the Talon arm (67% +/- 32%) versus control (58% +/- 24%); however, this was not statistically significant (P = 0.41). Use of the Talon was associated with decreased use of opiates (21.3 +/- 11.8 vs. 25.4 +/- 21.6 mg, P = 0.44), increased ability to ambulate 1000 ft on postoperative day 5 (25% vs. 13%, P = 0.28), and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation (median 0.5 vs 1.0 days, P = 0.24) and hospital length of stay (4.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 5.3 +/- 4.0 days, P = 0.40). One superficial sternal wound infection was observed in each study arm. There were no cases of nonunion. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, the primary endpoint was not statistically different between the treatment groups. Use of the Talon was associated with trends toward benefit in endpoints consistent with enhanced postoperative recovery, highlighting a need for additional data from larger randomized trials.", "BACKGROUND: We developed a new sternal fixation device, Super FIXSORB WAVE((R)), a corrugated plate made of u-HA/PLLA, to improve sternal stability after sternotomy. This present study aimed to evaluate the new device clinically. METHODS: This prospective, single-blinded, multicenter trial randomized 69 patients to either wire cerclage only (group C, n = 30) or wire cerclage plus Super FIXSORB WAVE((R)) (group W, n = 39). The primary endpoint was a degree of sternal displacement at six months. Displacement of the sternal halves in the anteroposterior and lateral directions was measured using computed tomography horizontal section images at the third costal and fourth intercostal levels. The secondary endpoints were sternal pain and quality-of-life over 6 months. RESULTS: Group W showed significantly reduced sternal anteroposterior displacement at both the third costal (0 [0-1.9] mm vs. 1.1 [0-2.1] mm; P = 0.014) and fourth intercostal (0 [0-1.0] mm) vs. 1.0 [0-1.8] mm; P = 0.015) levels than group C. In group W, lateral displacement was suppressed without a significant increase from 2 weeks to 6 months, while it increased in group C. There was no significant difference in postoperative sternal pain and quality-of-life between the two groups. No adverse events, such as infection, inflammation, or foreign body reaction, were observed with this device. CONCLUSIONS: Using Super FIXSORB WAVE((R)), sternal displacement was significantly suppressed in both the anteroposterior and lateral directions. The use of this device results in safe and easy sternal reinforcement without any adverse events, and sternal healing can be accelerated.

{"question": "Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma: a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Neutrophil infiltration of the lung is characteristic of early posttraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study examines the ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: University Hospital Wales, the Royal Gwent Hospital, and East Glamorgan General Hospital. Laboratory work was conducted at the Institute of Nephrology. PATIENTS: Adult blunt trauma victims with Injury Severity Score > or = 18. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Neutrophils were isolated from citrated blood from 17 adult blunt major trauma patients at admission (0 hrs) and 8 and 24 hrs later. Identical samples were obtained from normal laboratory volunteers (n = 9). The neutrophil count in each specimen was measured, and the number of neutrophils migrating across porous tissue culture inserts in response to defined concentrations of interleukin-8 (0, 10, 30, and 100 ng/mL) was quantitated by peroxidase assay. Neutrophil counts in the whole blood specimens obtained from those later developing ARDS were elevated significantly at admission and declined rapidly throughout the next 24 hrs. Significantly greater numbers of trauma patients' neutrophils migrated to concentrations of interleukin-8 (30 and 100 ng/mL) at each time point when compared with normal volunteers (Mann-Whitney U test, p <.05). Neutrophils isolated from major trauma patients exhibited an enhanced migratory response to high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hrs of admission, in contrast to the normal physiologic attenuation of migration seen in neutrophils isolated from normal laboratory volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS."]}
{"question": "BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR : are correlated results possible from homebrew assays?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Quantitative real-time PCR has become the predominant molecular technique to monitor BCRABL levels in response to treatment in Ph(+) leukemia patients. However, without some form of standardized methodology between laboratories, the correlation of results is difficult. METHODS: Using TaqMan-based assays, parallel quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed on 70 clinical specimens at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Virginia Commonwealth University. While the same positive control cell line (K562) and quality control gene (BCR) were used, the RNA isolation technique, cDNA synthesis, BCR control cell line, and PCR primer and probe sequences were different. RESULTS: The detection of BCRABL-positive results spanned a dynamic range from 10(0) to 10(5)/100,000 cells. Forty-three samples were negative at both facilities. A Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed for the 22 BCRABL-positive paired results. The correlation coefficient, r(s), was 0.9435 (p < 0.00001), suggesting a strong correlation of the results. One discordant result was obtained for consecutive samples from one patient with a low BCRABL copy number as a result of a minimal RNA yield at one laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared."]}
{"question": "Does a physician's specialty influence the recording of medication history in patients' case notes?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIMS: To determine the impact of a physician's specialty on the frequency and depth of medication history documented in patient medical records. METHODS: A cross-sectional assessment of the frequency and depth of medication history information documented by 123 physicians for 900 randomly selected patients stratified across Cardiology, Chest, Dermatology, Endocrine, Gastroenterology, Haematology, Neurology, Psychiatry and Renal specialties was carried out at a 900-bed teaching hospital located in Ibadan, Nigeria. RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-three (49.2%) of the cohort were males and 457 (50.8%) were females; with mean ages 43.2 +/- 18.6 and 43.1 +/- 17.9 years respectively. Physicians' specialties significantly influenced the depth of documentation of the medication history information across the nine specialties (P < 0.0001). Post hoc pair-wise comparisons with Tukey's HSD test showed that the mean scores for adverse drug reactions and adherence to medicines was highest in the Cardiology specialty; while the Chest specialty had the highest mean scores for allergy to drugs, food, chemicals and cigarette smoking. Mean scores for the use of alcohol; illicit drugs; dietary restrictions was highest for Gastroenterology, Psychiatry and Endocrine specialties respectively. Physicians' specialties also significantly influenced the frequency of documentation of the medication history across the nine specialties (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians appear to document more frequently and in greater depth medication history information that may aid the diagnostic tasks in their specific specialty. Researchers and other users of medication history data documented in patients' medical records by physicians may want to take special cognizance of this phenomenon.", "A substantial number of medical errors in radiology are attributed to failures of perception or decision making, although it is believed that experience (or expertise) might buffer diagnosticians from some types of perceptual-cognitive bias. We examined how the quality of contextual information influences decision making and how underlying perceptual-cognitive processes change as a function of experience and diagnostic accuracy. Twenty-one radiologists dictated their findings on 16 deidentified musculoskeletal radiographic cases while wearing a mobile-eye tracking system. Patient histories were mismatched on a subset of cases to be miscued relative to the correct diagnosis. Experienced radiologists outperformed less-experienced participants, but no systematic differences in gaze behaviors emerged between groups. Miscued case notes increased perceptual-cognitive bias in both groups, resulting in an approximate 40% decrease in diagnostic accuracy. Most errors were judgment errors, meaning participants visually fixated on the abnormality for longer than a second yet still failed to make the correct diagnosis. Findings suggest a physician's confidence in their diagnosis might be misplaced after spending insufficient time extracting relevant information from key areas of the visual display, or when decisions are based primarily on a priori expectations derived from patient histories.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency of documented sleep histories by medical house officers (HOs) in an ambulatory medicine clinic and to assess whether a chart reminder influences their performance. DESIGN: We reviewed the performance of medical HOs after introduction of a medical record form that included a simple sleep history prompt among reminders relating to health promotion. For each of 108 HOs, we randomly selected a chart with a sleep history prompt and one without. RESULTS: Any sleep history was documented in only 37 of 216 medical records (17%), including 21 of 122 patients (17%) with risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Use of chart reminders was associated with nearly a fivefold increase of sleep histories (29% vs 6%, p < 0.001), and charts with prompts had more notations about specific sleep complaints (2.6 +/- 0.9 vs 1.0 +/- 0.0 notes per patient, p < 0.0001). Sleep histories were recorded less often (p < 0.001) than histories of cigarette smoking or alcohol use. Although 24% of physicians appeared to be influenced by the prompt, sleep problems were included on problem lists of only six patients (3%). Overall, the frequencies of diagnostic studies (1% of all patients, 6% of those with sleep histories) or documented therapeutic recommendations (0%) relating to sleep were low, whether or not chart reminders were used, with sleep testing obtained in only one patient. Sleep interventions were documented less often than smoking cessation or weight loss (p < 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep histories are seldom documented by medical HOs, even in patients at risk for OSA. Use of a simple chart reminder was associated with an increased frequency of recorded sleep histories, but had no clear impact on diagnosis or treatment. If sleep problems and their management are to be prioritized appropriately, then the obstacles to obtaining sleep histories and to following up cues to sleep disorders must be clarified and overcome.", "World War I witnessed the admission of large numbers of German soldiers with neurological symptoms for which there was no obvious organic cause. This posed a considerable challenge for the military and medical authorities and resulted in an active discussion on the etiology and treatment of these disorders. Current historiography is reliant on published physician accounts, and this represents the first study of treatment approaches based on original case notes. We analyzed patient records from two leading departments of academic psychiatry in Germany, those at Berlin and Jena, in conjunction with the contemporaneous medical literature. Treatment, which can be broadly classified into reward and punishment, suggestion, affective shock, cognitive learning, and physiological methods, was developed in the context of the emerging fields of animal learning and neurophysiology. A further innovative feature was the use of quantitative methods to assess outcomes. These measures showed good response rates, though most cured patients were not sent back to battle because of their presumed psychopathic constitution. While some treatments appear unnecessarily harsh from today's perspective and were also criticized by leading psychiatrists of the time, the concentration of effort and involvement of so many senior doctors led to the development of psychotherapeutic methods that were to influence the field of psychiatric therapy for decades to come.", "PURPOSE: The present study was undertaken to investigate epidemiological distribution, clinical manifestation, co morbid status, treatment strategy and case fatality index of emerging COVID-19 infection at SMS Medical College Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan. It also evaluated efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treatment of patients and risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 in relation to their co morbid status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an attempt to provide extensive information pertaining to epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, the present study was undertaken on 522 patients. The patients were COVID-19 confirmed positive by genomic analysis through Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at SMS Medical College and Attached Hospitals, Jaipur. The indoor admitted patient's information inclusive of demographic profile (age, sex, nationality, residence), date of confirmation for positive COVID-19 case, travel/ exposure history, date of recovery/ death, clinical features, co morbidities and treatment plan was recorded. A serial follow-up of recovered patients to evaluate infective period of the disease was also part of the study. RESULTS: A total of 522 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 test by RT-PCR at SMS Hospitals, Jaipur were assessed. Among the confirmed cases, most of patients were young adult in the age group with mean age of 35.42 years. 22.41% patients were below 20 years of age, majority of patients (58.80%) were in the age range of 21 to 50 years and only 18.79% patient population was in the age range of above 50 years. Females (39.08%) were affected less than males (60.91%) with an average sex ratio of female: male being 0.64. Out of the total analyzed patients, only 24.32% patients were symptomatic, among them fever (55.90%), cough (52.75%), sore throat (49.60%) and shortness of breath (46.45%) were the most common presenting clinical manifestations while a few patients also had symptoms of headache (26.77%), chest pain (6.29%) and other symptoms (7.87%) like pain abdomen, fatigue, joints pain, altered sensorium etc. Most of symptomatic patients belonging to older age group. An average of 40.40% patient population of above 50 years of age, were symptomatic while none of the patients below 10 years of age were symptomatic. 13.98% patients had some or the other underlying co morbid disease. The most prevalent co morbidity was hypertension (42.46%) followed by Diabetes mellitus (39.72%), Old k-chest (20.54%), COPD/ Bronchial Asthma (16.43%), Coronary artery disease (13.69%), Chronic kidney disease (13.69%) and Valvular heart disease (6.84%) distributed in co morbid patients of COVID-19. 60.27% of patient population with underlying co morbid conditions were more prone to develop symptomatology complex as compared to that observed in patients with no co morbidity (18.42%). 116 patients had recovered with effective treatment till the date of data analysis. Time of recovery was counted from the date of positive report to 1st negative report of oropharyngeal sample by RT-PCR for COVID-19 with an average recovery time of 8.15 days. 23.27% patients recovered within 5 days, while 52.58% patients took about 6-10 days, 23.27% patients took 11-15 days and remaining 0.86% took more than 16 days to recover. In the present study 15 patients had died till analysis of data, among the deceased, 73.33% were above 50 year of age with a male preponderance (66.6%). Interestingly, all deceased (100%) had presented with clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and all had underlying multiple co morbid conditions. Majority of patients had early mortality after admission to hospital with two third death account in initial three days. Asymptomatic patients (cases) treated with HCQ recovered early (average recovery time =5.4 days) compared to asymptomatic patients who did not receive any treatment (control group) and had longer recovery time (average recovery time =7.6 days). CONCLUSION: The varied spectra of COVID-19 mostly affects young adult age group (third to fifth decades of life). Interestingly, early age group was also affected in significant proportion when compared with similar data from other countries. It was observed that male population seemed to be was more prone to getting infected. Majority of COVID-19 positive patients (nearly three-fourth) were asymptomatic (mostly in young age range) at the time of diagnosis, which poses a major challenge for health care workers. Fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath were major symptoms that could be detected in such COVID-19 patients. Symptomatic clinical manifestations were more common in old age population. Infectivity was higher in patients that had underlying co morbid disease, especially in patients with multiple co morbid conditions. Symptomatic presentation of COVID-19 was observed to be higher in patients with co morbid disease. Average recovery time from COVID-19 was 8 days with effective treatment. Mortality in COVID-19 was higher in old age population, male gender, symptomatic and co morbid patients as compared to other similarly matched group. Most of mortality was noted within first few days of admission, suggestive of early mortality due to the primary disease process. Treatment with HCQ had early recovery without effectively influencing the overall mortality."]}
{"question": "Is renal warm ischemia over 30 minutes during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy possible?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To evaluate renal damage and impairment of renal function 1 yr after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) with warm ischemia >30 min. METHODS: From July 2004 to June 2005, 18 patients underwent LPN with warm ischemia time >30 min. Kidney damage markers (daily proteinuria and tubular enzymes) and renal function (serum creatinine, cystatin C, and creatinine clearances) were assessed on postoperative days 1 and 5 and at 12 mo. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was evaluated before surgery and at 3 mo. Renal scintigraphy was performed before the procedure, at 5 d and at 3 and 12 mo postoperatively. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student t test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In terms of kidney damage and renal function markers, the statistical analysis demonstrated that at 1 yr there was complete return to the normal range and no statistical difference between the values at the various time points. The GFR was not significantly different before and 3 mo after surgery. In terms of scintigraphy of the operated kidney, the values were 48.35+/-3.82% (40-50%) before the procedure, 36.88+/-8.42 (16-50%) on postoperative day 5 (p=0.0001), 40.56+/-8.96 (20-50%) at 3 mo (p=0.003), and 42.8+/-7.2% (20-50%) 1 yr after surgery (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that kidney damage occurs during LPN when warm ischemia is >30 min. This damage is only partially reversible and efforts should be made to keep warm ischemia within 30 min.", "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate establishment of overnight stay only as sufficient after robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN). METHODS: Stated benefits of minimally invasive surgery include reduced hospitalization, but published hospital stays after laparoscopic or robotic partial nephrectomy are not significantly less than with open surgery. We developed a clinical pathway targeting discharge on postoperative day (POD) 1 after RPN of any complexity. We reviewed all RPNs by a single surgeon since instituting our clinical pathway, including ambulation and diet the night of surgery, avoidance of intravenous narcotics and drains, and catheter removal on POD 1 before discharge. Targeted discharge was not modified regardless of RPN complexity. RESULTS: A total of 150 consecutive patients underwent 160 RPNs with 35 hilar tumors and 26 with segmental, and 33 with no artery clamping. Three had solitary kidneys, and 8 underwent multiple (range, 2-4) RPNs. Mean patient age was 57 years (range, 22-89 years), and body mass index was 32 kg/m(2) (range, 18-54 kg/m(2)). Mean tumor size was 3.6 cm (range, 1.0-11.0; median, 3.2 cm), and the RENAL (radius, exophytic/endophytic, nearness to collecting system, anterior/posterior, and location) nephrometry score was 8 (range, 4-12; median, 8). Mean warm ischemia time was 12.1 minutes (range, 0-30.0 minutes). Mean preoperative and discharge creatinine were 0.9 mg/dL (range, 0.43-2.79 mg/dL) and 1.13 mg/dL (range, 0.56-2.93 mg/dL). All patients ambulated on POD 0. One patient required one dose of intravenous narcotic. Mean length of stay was 1.1 days, with 145 (97%) discharged on POD 1, of which only 4 (2.7%) were readmitted within 30 days. CONCLUSION: Discharge on POD 1 is feasible in most RPN patients regardless of complexity. Readmission rate was low, indicating that longer admissions may not prevent complications when patients meeting discharge criteria go home on POD 1."]}
{"question": "Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities: Are they detected by rapid prescreening?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Rapid prescreening (RPS) is one of the quality assurance (QA) methods used in gynecologic cytology. The efficacy of RPS has been previously studied but mostly with respect to squamous lesions; in fact, there has been no study so far specifically looking at the sensitivity of RPS for detecting glandular cell abnormalities. METHODS: A total of 80,565 Papanicolaou (Pap) smears underwent RPS during a 25-month period. A sample was designated as \"review for abnormality\" (R) if any abnormal cells (at the threshold of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells [AGC]) were thought to be present or was designated as negative (N) if none were detected. Each sample then underwent full screening (FS) and was designated as either R or N and also given a cytologic interpretation. RESULTS: The final cytologic interpretation was a glandular cell abnormality (>/=AGC) in 107 samples (0.13%); 39 of these (36.4%) were flagged as R on RPS. Twenty-four patients (33.8%) out of 71 who had histologic follow-up were found to harbor a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or carcinoma; 13 of those 24 Pap smears (54.2%) had been flagged as R on RPS. Notably, 11 AGC cases were picked up by RPS only and not by FS and represented false-negative cases; 2 of these showed endometrial adenocarcinoma on histologic follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities are often flagged as abnormal by RPS, and this results in a sensitivity of 36.4% (at the AGC threshold). Most importantly, some cases of AGC are detected on Pap smears by RPS only, and this demonstrates that RPS is a valuable QA method."]}
{"question": "The HELPP syndrome--evidence of a possible systemic inflammatory response in pre-eclampsia?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: The principal causes of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy in Mexico, are preeclampsia/eclampsia, obstetric hemorrhage and puerperium complications; this is, 62% of maternal deaths in last years. HELLP syndrome was observed between 5 to 25% of the mortality in pregnancies of 36 weeks or less. OBJECTIVE: To analyze patients with HELLP syndrome in ICU's (Intensive Care Unit) of a Gynecology and Obstetric Hospital, related to the abnormal hematological, hepatic and renal results with the obstetric case history and the clinical complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A transversal study in patients with HELLP syndrome during 1998 and 1999 were carry out. CASE DEFINITION: Peripheral blood with Microangiopathic hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes: AST, ALT over 40 UI/L, even when were LDH lower than 600 UI/L. It was evaluated the hepatic and renal function, platelets count, microangiopathic hemolysis, arterial pressure, seizures, icteric skin color, blindness, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting and upper quadrant right abdominal pain. In newborn we analyzed gestational age, sex, weight and APGAR. We studied for an association between maternal and biochemical variables with Correlation Pearson Test, and dependence between variables with lineal regression model. RESULTS: 2878 patients with hypertensives disorders in pregnancy (11.64%). The 1.15% (n = 33) had HELLP syndrome with specific maternal mortality of 0.4 per 10,000 live birth, perinatal mortality of 1.62 per 10,000 live birth; and renal damage in 84.5%. Coefficient beta was higher between number of pregnancies to platelets count (-0.33) and creatinine clearance (-0.401). CONCLUSION: We found an important renal damage, low platelets, elevated liver enzymes in women with two or more pregnancies. Then we propose there are similarities between HELLP syndrome and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) because they could have the same pathophysiology."]}
{"question": "Hepatic arterial embolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas: do technical factors affect prognosis?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To evaluate retrospectively whether technical factors of hepatic arterial embolization affect the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria of this study were the following: (1) patients received embolization as the initial treatment during 2003-2004, (2) Child A or B liver profile, (3) five or fewer HCCs with maximum diameter of 7 cm or smaller, and (4) no extrahepatic metastasis. Patient data were gathered from 43 centers. Prognostic factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Eight hundred fifteen patients were enrolled. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival rates were 92.0 % (95 % CI 90.1-93.9), 62.9 % (95 % CI 59.3-66.6), 39.0 % (95 % CI 35.1-43.0), and 26.7 % (95 % CI 22.6-30.8) in all patients. Univariate analysis showed a Child-Pugh class-A, alpha-fetoprotein level lower than 100 ng/ml, tumor size of 3 cm or smaller, tumor number of 3 or fewer, one-lobe tumor distribution, nodular tumor type, within the Milan criteria, stage I or II, no portal venous invasion, use of iodized oil, and selective embolization were significantly better prognostic factors. In the multivariate Cox model, the benefit to survival of selective embolization remained significant (hazard ratio 0.68; 95 % CI 0.48-0.97; p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Selective embolization contributes to survival in patients with HCCs.", "Ninety-two consecutive patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) greater than 2 cm and less than 5 cm in diameter were treated by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using autologous blood clot as an embolizing agent (Short-TAE; S-TAE). Survival, patency of hepatic arteries and side effects were retrospectively analyzed. The median follow-up interval was 42 months. The median size of the main tumor was 3.4 cm in diameter. All tumors were determined to be inoperable because of intrahepatic spread of tumors and/or poor hepatic functional reserves. S-TAE was performed by injecting a mixture of iodized oil and anticancer drugs followed by embolization of hepatic arteries with autologous blood clot. Embolization with clots maintained patency of hepatic arteries in all the patients. The overall survival rates for 92 HCC patients at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8 years were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method to be 100, 52, 34, 12 and 6%, respectively, which were better compared with prior records for conventional method with gelfoam. S-TAE was successfully performed in 16 patients with Childs class C liver cirrhosis presenting icterus and ascitis. The survival rates for Childs class C patients at 1, 2 and 3 years were 100, 66 and 32%, respectively. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess influence of each pretreatment parameter (age, gender, virus marker, stage of cirrhosis, number of tumor) on survival. The univariate analysis demonstrated that both the stage of cirrhosis and the multiplicity of tumor were significant factors predicting survival (p=0.003 and 0.046, respectively). The multivariate analysis showed the stage of cirrhosis to be the sole factor which significantly affected prognosis of HCC patients (p=0.005). In conclusion, chemoembolization with autologous blood clot is an effective and safe therapeutic option for unresectable HCC smaller than 5 cm. The hepatic functional reserves play a key role in determining prognosis of HCC patients.", "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with embospheres for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Patients with unresectable HCC who were treated with TACE followed by embosphere treatment (Embo-TACE) or conventional TACE (cTACE) between May 2010 and March 2014 were retrospectively included in this study. The Embo-TACE group received lipiodol and chemotherapeutic agent emulsion, followed by embospheres. The cTACE group received lipiodol and chemotherapeutic agent emulsion, followed by gelatin sponge pellets. Time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and safety were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses of the factors affecting survival were conducted. RESULTS: The median TTP and OS in the Embo-TACE group were significantly longer than those in the cTACE group (TPP: 7.0 months vs 5.4 months, P = 0.035; OS: 15 months vs 12 months, P = 0.032). Seven days after the first TACE treatment, alanine aminotransferase level was higher in the cTACE group than in the Embo-TACE group (P = 0.015). The ORR did not significantly differ between the two groups (P = 0.827). Additional therapy and local responses one month after the first TACE treatment were associated with OS. CONCLUSIONS: Embo-TACE resulted in a significant improvement in TTP and OS for patients with unresectable HCC, compared with cTACE. Furthermore, Embo-TACE was better tolerated. Additional therapy and local responses one month after the first TACE were independent prognostic factors for OS.", "BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant cancers worldwide. Less than 30% of patients are suitable candidates for surgery. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered as a first-line treatment for patients with unresectable advanced liver cancer. In the routine diagnosis and treatment pathway for unresectable HCC, a biopsy is usually performed firstly, followed by hepatic artery angiography and TACE. However, hepatic artery angiography data reveals that the risk of arteriovenous shunt (AVS) is significantly increased following biopsy, which negatively affects the outcomes of TACE. AIM: To investigate the feasibility of delayed biopsy following TACE in patients with HCC. METHODS: Data from 112 patients with a definitive diagnosis of HCC were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who underwent biopsy immediately after TACE formed the experimental group (n = 55) and those who underwent biopsy before TACE formed the control group (n = 57). Positive pathological diagnosis rate, incidence of AVS, and rates of TACE-related complications were compared between the two groups. In addition, factors affecting the occurrence of AVS were assessed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in positive pathological diagnosis rate between the experimental and control groups (81.8% vs. 77.2%, respectively; P = 0.545). The incidence of AVS in the experimental group was lower than that in the control group (3.6% vs. 22.8%, respectively; P = 0.003), and embolization results were better in the experimental group. There was no difference in the incidence of TACE-related complications between the two groups. Late tumor stage (P = 0.04) and pre-TACE biopsy puncture (P = 0.003) are associated with the occurrence of AVS. CONCLUSION: In patients with HCC, delayed biopsy following completion of TACE did not affect pathological diagnosis results and yielded better embolization outcomes. Therefore, delayed biopsy following completion of TACE in patients with HCC is worth popularizing for clinical use. However, with the development of precision medicine, the diagnosis and treatment of tumor will certainly advance to the molecular level, whether the ischemic and oxygen-deficient tumor microenvironment caused by TACE treatment will have an impact on tumor tissue at molecular level remains unknown.", "OBJECTIVE: To study the therapeutic results of hepatic resection for shrunk hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and hepatic artery ligation and chemoembolization (HALCE) in patients with unresectable HCC, and compare the influence of the above different treatment modalities on the prognosis. METHODS: Two hundred and four patients w ith pathologically proven HCC by two stage liver resection were classified into two groups: TACE group (n = 112) and HALEC group (n = 92). The patients in the TACE group received a total of 1-7 consecutive treatment courses (average, 2.4 +/- 1.2 courses). HALCE was done in 49 patients. HALCE alternating fractionated radiotherapy was employed in 7 patients and HALCE + targeting regional internal radiotherapy in 36. Shrunk tumors were surgically removed by two-stage operation in all the patients with unresectable HCC. Seven possible factors influencing the results of two-stage resection of HCC were studied. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up to June, 1999. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year survival rates were 95.7%, 69.3%, 56.5% and 44.5% after the first TACE and HALCE, respectively and 88.5%, 64.9%, 51.9% and 38.3% after resection of the shrunk HCC, respectively. The 1-, 3-, 5- and 7-year survival rates were 94.1%, 64.7%, 51.2% and 40.8% respectively in the TACE group and 96.3%, 73.9%, 61.6% and 45.2% respectively in the HALCE group. There were no statistically differences between the survival rates in the TACE and HALCE groups. The extent of cirrhotic liver and percentage of tumor necrosis were of prognostic significance. In the TACE group, the extent of cirrhotic liver, the percentage of tumor necrosis and whether capsule of shrunk tumor was complete or in complete were of prognostic significance. In the HALCE group, however, the 7 factors were not found to be statistically significant for the prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential resection should be done after cytoreduction of tumor for the patients with unresectable HCC, which might improve their survival. The extent of cirrhotic liver and the percentage of tumor necrosis after TACE or HALCE are the major factors affecting the survival of patients with two-stage operation."]}
{"question": "Are pelvic anatomical structures in danger during arthroscopic acetabular labral repair?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate safe depth for suture anchor insertion during acetabular labral repair and to determine the neighbouring structures at risk during drilling and anchor insertion. METHODS: Ten human cadaveric hips (six males and four females) were obtained. Acetabular labral surface was prepared and marked for right hips as 12, 1 and 3 o'clock positions, for left hips 12, 11 and 9 o'clock positions. Those were defined as anterior, anterior-superior and superior zones, respectively. These labral positions were drilled at defined zones. After measurements, depth of the bone at 10 degrees  and 20 degrees drill angles on zones was compared statistically. RESULTS: Acetabular bone widths at investigated labral insertion points did not statistically differ. A total of 14 injuries in 60 penetrations occurred (23.3 %) with free drill penetrations, and no injuries occurred with stopped drill penetrations. The bone depth was gradually decreasing from 10 degrees  to 20 degrees  drill angles and from anterior to superior inserting zones without significant importance. The risk of perforation to the pelvic cavity started with 20 mm drill depth, and the mean depth for all insertions was calculated as 31.7 mm (SD 2.6). CONCLUSIONS: It is anatomically possible that some pelvic structures sustain iatrogenic injury during acetabular drilling for anchor placement. Being aware of mean pelvic vault is important in which drilling after excessive pincer rim trimming could easily decrease the depth of acetabular bone without a standard. Careful drilling by using stopped drill bit is crucial to prevent iatrogenic injury."]}
{"question": "Does pediatric housestaff experience influence tests ordered for infants in the neonatal intensive care unit?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between the experience of pediatric housestaff and tests ordered on infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN: Prospective, cohort study over one full academic year. SETTING: One academic Level III neonatal intensive care nursery. PATIENTS: Data were collected prospectively on all 785 infants admitted to the neonatal ICU from July 1993 to June 1994. These infants were cared for by 14 different categorical pediatric housestaff. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our neonatal ICU has either a resident or an intern on-call by himself/herself at night, affording us a natural setting to compare intern vs. resident test ordering. The outcomes of interest were number of arterial blood gases, radiographs, and electrolytes ordered per infant by the on-call pediatric houseofficer, as tabulated the morning after the call night. Control variables included the severity-of-illness of the individual infant (using the Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System), the workload of the houseofficer (number of patients, number of admissions), and supervision (rounding frequency and on-call attending). Controlling for the severity-of-illness of the infant, the workload on the call night, and supervision with multiple linear regression, we found that interns ordered significantly (p = .02) greater numbers of arterial blood gases per infant than residents, amounting to some 0.33 blood gases per infant per call night (3.22 vs. 2.89 arterial blood gases per infant per night). This increase of 0.33 blood gases per infant amounts to interns ordering $169 more arterial blood gases per call night at our institution. There was no difference between interns and residents in ordering radiographs or electrolytes. CONCLUSION: Interns order significantly more arterial blood gases per infant than junior and senior residents on-call in the neonatal ICU. Additional study is required to see if the experience of housestaff is associated with a broader array of neonatal outcomes, such as morbidity and mortality."]}
{"question": "Is robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: While radical retropubic prostatectomy has been the gold standard surgical approach, the explosion of minimally invasive methods has led to the search for less invasive treatment options. We offer an overview of the evolution of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in terms of the landmark publications and recent head-to-head comparisons, and we review our own experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Medline search was performed using the keywords prostate cancer, prostatectomy, laparoscopic, and robotic. All pertinent articles concerning localized prostate cancer were reviewed. The Montefiore experience consisted of a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained confidential database. RESULTS: Several laparoscopic and robotic series were identified including review articles of each modality as well as studies directly comparing the two. Both LRP and RALP compare very favorably with conventional open surgery in terms of safety and oncologic efficacy. Both minimally invasive approaches offer decreased blood loss, transfusion rate, and length of hospital stay when contrasted with open surgery. When compared directly, LRP and RALP offer similar surgical, oncologic, and functional outcomes. However, RALP likely requires a shorter learning curve. CONCLUSION: The use of minimally invasive techniques has revolutionized the surgical treatment of prostate cancer. Pure LRP has been shown to be feasible and reproducible. However, it has a steep learning curve and is difficult to learn. In contrast, RALP is easier to learn and is now the surgical treatment of choice in most centers of excellence in the United States. The superior optics with respect to visualization and magnification translates into a procedure that is equivalent, if not superior, with respect to perioperative parameters, oncologic outcomes, and functional outcomes to its open counterpart.", "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether robotically assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) is less invasive than radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP), as experimental studies suggest that the acute phase reaction is proportional to surgery-induced tissue damage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May and November 2006, all patients undergoing RRP or RALP in our department were prospectively assessed. Blood samples were collected 24 h before (T0), during surgery (T1), at the end of anaesthesia (T2), and 12 (T3) and 24 h after surgery (T4), and assayed for interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-1 alpha, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate. The Mann-Whitney U-, Student's t- and Friedman tests were used to compare continuous variables, and the Pearson chi-square and Fisher test for categorical variables, with a two-sided P < 0.05 considered to indicate significance. RESULTS: In all, 35 and 26 patients were assessed for RALP and RRP, respectively; the median (interquartile range) age was 62 (56-68) and 68.5 (59.2-71.2) years, respectively (P < 0.009). Baseline levels (T0) of IL-1, IL-6, CRP and lactate were comparable in both arms. IL-6, CRP and lactates levels increased during both kinds of surgery. The mean IL-6 and CPR values were higher for RRP at T1 (P = 0.01 and 0.001), T2 (P = 0.001 and <0.001), T3 (P = 0.002 and <0.001) and T4 (P < 0.001 and 0.02), respectively. Lactate was higher for RRP at T2 (P = 0.001), T3 (P = 0.001) and T4 (P = 0.004), although remaining within the normal ranges. IL-1 alpha did not change at the different sample times. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "BACKGROUND: Radical retropubic prostatectomy remains the gold standard treatment for localized prostate cancer. However, new minimally invasive techniques have emerged, providing a less invasive approach. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is the ideal technique, providing good oncologic and functional outcomes. We analyzed the impact of robotic surgical systems on practice patterns among urologists to explain changes in the value of radical retropubic prostatectomy, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in a single institution in Taiwan. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who received prostatectomy by one of the above procedures between January 2004 and November 2009. Decisions to perform these procedures were made by patient preference. Patients who received prostate biopsies at other hospitals were transferred to our hospital specifically for robotic-assisted prostatectomy. RESULTS: A total of 434 radical prostatectomies were performed, of which 141 (32.49%) were radical retropubic prostatectomies, 59 (13.59%) were laparoscopic radical prostatectomies and 234 (53.92%) were robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomies. The overall number of prostatectomies has increased over time because of an increase in robotic-assisted procedures. No decreases were seen in the number of radical retropubic prostatectomies during the evaluation period. Changes in the ratio of robotic-assisted prostatectomies compared to radical retropubic and laparoscopic radical prostatectomies demonstrated a trend toward robotic-assisted procedures. The percentage of cases transferred from other hospitals also increased over time from 28.57% to 68.60%. CONCLUSION: Our experience emphasizes the potential of robotic-assisted prostatectomy to become the mainstream treatment for localized prostate cancer in Taiwan.", "Open retropubic radical prostatectomy is the gold standard treatment for localised prostate cancer. However, the procedure has inherent morbidity associated to it. Therefore, less invasive surgical techniques have been sought, one such alternative is robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The advantages provided by robotic technology have the potential to minimise patient morbidity while improving both functional and oncological outcomes. Although it is a recent technological advancement, robotic surgery has shown an increasing rate of adoption worldwide. Currently more than 30,000 patients have undergone this procedure worldwide. We present a review of the available literature on robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.", "Radical prostatectomy has maintained a cardinal role in the treatment of localized carcinoma of the prostate. The combination of refinements in surgical technique and better definition of the anatomy have decreased the morbidity from surgery. Nonetheless, concerns about treatment-related side effects remain the primary limitation of surgical therapy for prostate cancer. Laparoscopic prostatectomy, with or without robotic assistance, is playing an increasing role in surgical treatment of prostate cancer. However, the minimally invasive aspect of laparoscopy may have less relevance for radical prostatectomy because the open surgical procedure requires a limited infraumbilical incision. In the present series comparing robotically assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with open radical retropubic prostatectomy, no difference was seen in postoperative pain, length of stay, or requirement for blood replacement. However, the most important outcome measures are tumor control, continence, and sexual potency. The outstanding visibility and precision afforded by the robotic approach may offer advantages in each of these areas."]}
{"question": "c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells: a potential therapeutic target?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: This study was conducted to investigate the expression and functional impact of the proto-oncogene c-kit in uveal melanoma. METHODS: Based on immunohistochemical (IHC) study of paraffin-embedded specimens from 134 uveal melanomas and Western blot analysis on eight fresh-frozen samples the expression of c-kit in uveal melanoma was studied. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-kit and the impact of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was examined in the three uveal melanoma cell lines OCM-1, OCM-3, and 92-1. RESULTS: Eighty-four of 134 paraffin-embedded samples and six of eight fresh-frozen samples expressed c-kit. c-Kit was strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells compared with cutaneous melanoma cells. Moreover, in contrast to cutaneous melanoma cell lines c-kit maintained a high phosphorylation level in serum-depleted uveal melanoma cells. No activation-related mutations in exon 11 of the KIT gene were found. On the contrary, expression of the stem cell growth factor (c-kit ligand) was detected in all three uveal melanoma cell lines, suggesting the presence of autocrine (paracrine) stimulation pathways. Treatment of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, resulted in cell death. The IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was of equal size and less than 2.5 microM. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571."]}
{"question": "Is anorectal endosonography valuable in dyschesia?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIMS: Dyschesia can be provoked by inappropriate defecation movements. The aim of this prospective study was to demonstrate dysfunction of the anal sphincter and/or the musculus (m.) puborectalis in patients with dyschesia using anorectal endosonography. METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with a medical history of dyschesia and a control group of 20 healthy subjects underwent linear anorectal endosonography (Toshiba models IUV 5060 and PVL-625 RT). In both groups, the dimensions of the anal sphincter and the m. puborectalis were measured at rest, and during voluntary squeezing and straining. Statistical analysis was performed within and between the two groups. RESULTS: The anal sphincter became paradoxically shorter and/or thicker during straining (versus the resting state) in 85% of patients but in only 35% of control subjects. Changes in sphincter length were statistically significantly different (p<0.01, chi(2) test) in patients compared with control subjects. The m. puborectalis became paradoxically shorter and/or thicker during straining in 80% of patients but in only 30% of controls. Both the changes in length and thickness of the m. puborectalis were significantly different (p<0.01, chi(2) test) in patients versus control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Linear anorectal endosonography demonstrated incomplete or even absent relaxation of the anal sphincter and the m. puborectalis during a defecation movement in the majority of our patients with dyschesia. This study highlights the value of this elegant ultrasonographic technique in the diagnosis of \"pelvic floor dyssynergia\" or \"anismus\".", "BACKGROUND: Endosonography may be used for diagnosing various anorectal disorders. This review addresses its technique and clinical use in benign anorectal disease. METHODS: The English literature available on anal endosonography was reviewed. The different modalities, the endosonography technique itself and its value in benign anorectal disease were described. RESULTS: Anal endosonography is easy to perform, has a short learning curve and causes less discomfort than routine digital examination. Anal sphincters can be clearly visualized and distinction is possible between the internal (hypoechoic) and external (hyperechoic) anal sphincters. Other pelvic floor structures, like the puborectalis muscle, can also be visualized. Endosonography is mostly used in the assessment of faecal incontinence; it has brought new insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of this disorder and can select patients with traumatic incontinence for sphincter repair. It has replaced electromyographical sphincter mapping, which is a painful and time-consuming procedure. In perianal sepsis, endosonography assists in defining fistula tract anatomy. The use of contrast agents has significantly increased the accuracy of endosonography in the assessment of perianal fistulae. In addition, endosonography is an excellent alternative to expensive MRI. Besides its use in incontinence and perianal sepsis, with anal endosonography surgical possibilities can be evaluated in individual patients, for example, to decide whether a sphincter repair or a lateral sphincterectomy is preferable. Finally, endosonography may occasionally identify internal sphincter myopathy in patients with intractable constipation or proctalgia. CONCLUSION: Anal endosonography images the internal and external sphincters with high accuracy. It is easy to perform and is especially valuable in the diagnosis of anal incontinence and perianal sepsis.", "BACKGROUND: Anorectal manometry is a valuable tool for objective assessment of motility motor and sensory function of the anorectum. The aim of this study was to investigate role of water-perfused (WP) three dimensional high-resolution anorectal manometry (3D-HRARM) compared to WP conventional manometry (CM) in the management of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and faecal incontinence (FI) in children. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 122 consecutive children, who had WP 8-channel CM or 24 channel 3D-HRARM and endosonography under ketamine anaesthesia from September 2012 to February 2019. All patients had a validated symptom severity score questionnaire ranging from 0 (best) to 65 (worst). Mann-Whitney-U test and Spearman rank test were used and p<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Subjects were divided according to investigation: CM group (n = 75) and 3D-HRAM (n = 47), who were otherwise comparable. Median anal resting pressure was 50 mmHg and rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) threshold volume was 10mls across the entire cohort. There were no significant differences in resting pressure or RAIR threshold when using conventional or 3D-HRARM. Rectal capacity was significantly higher in the CM group (p = 0.002). Rectal capacity and internal anal sphincter (IAS) thickness positively correlated with symptom severity, duration and patient age. 3D-HRARM provided a more detailed depiction of the anorectal pressure profile. Botulinum toxin was injected into the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle (n = 75, 61%) and an anterograde colonic enema (ACE) stoma was needed subsequently in 19 (16%) to treat recurrent constipation and soiling symptoms. Rectal biopsy was done in 43(35%) patients, if RAIR was absent or inconclusive. CONCLUSION: CM and 3D-HRARM are comparable in terms of resting pressure and RAIR threshold. 3D-HRAM is safe and provides detailed functional morphology of anal sphincters and it is useful to understand underlying pathophysiology of constipation and faecal incontinence in children and plan further treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I.", "Disturbances of anal continence and evacuation are frequent. Numerous techniques are now available to measure anorectal function. There is also a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the pelvic floor which has a major role in anorectal function. ANORECTAL MANOMETRY. Manometry of the anal canal is an index of the resistance of sphincters to the passage of faeces. Resting pressure is due mainly to the internal anal sphincter whereas voluntary contraction is due mainly to the external anal sphincter. Anorectal manometry is essential in measuring the length of the anal canal and in establishing the presence of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex. Several techniques are employed to evaluate anorectal manometry which is useful in the investigation of patients with faecal incontinence and constipation. PUDENDAL LATENCIES: Pudendal latencies are valuable in the study of the innervation of the external anal sphincter. Pudendal latencies are measured thanks to the stimulation of the S2-S4 nerves lying in the proximity of the ischial spine through the use of a special glove (St Mark's glove). Prolonged pudendal latencies are typical of neurogenic faecal incontinence but it can be brought about by childbirth, rectal prolapse, obstructed defecation and old age. ELECTROMYOGRAPHY. Electromyography is useful in the study of the function of the pelvic floor. This technique can be performed with single fibre needles which make it possible to measure the action potentials and the fibre density of the muscular fibres. Fibre density is raised in neurogenic faecal incontinence and the action potentials are polyphasic in this condition. Concentric needles are employed to map the anal sphincters and this is useful for evaluating the extent of the damage caused by traumatic events like a third degree tear. ANAL ENDOSONOGRAPHY. Anal ultrasound is very effective in the study of the morphology of the anal sphincters and it requires a rectal probe fitted with a 7-MHz transducer. It is as accurate as electromyography in evaluating the damage to the anal sphincters but it is not painful and it is more acceptable to the patient. DEFECOGRAPHY. This radiological test is a dynamic study of the pelvic floor during defecation. It is very useful for investigating the function and the morphology of the rectum and the pelvic floor during defecation. Important parameters like: the anorectal angle, the opening of the anal canal, the position of the pelvic floor and the descent of the perineum can be evaluated with this test. Defecography is useful in the study of patients with rectal prolapse and constipation. CONCLUSION. All these tests provide extremely useful information on the pelvic floor and are reproducible. They can be of great help in evaluating patients with pelvic floor disorders but they are no substitute for clinical judgement.", "The aim of this study was to evaluate role of anorectal manometry (ARM) and anal endosonography (ES) in assessment of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) quality on continence outcome following repair of anorectal anomalies (ARA). We devised a scoring system to evaluate the quality of the IAS based on ARM and ES and correlated the scores with clinical outcome, using a modified Wingfield score (MWS) for faecal continence. We also assessed the implication of megarectum and neuropathy on faecal continence. Of 54 children studied, 34 had high ARA and 20 had low ARA. Children with high ARA had poor sphincters on ES and ARM, and also poor faecal continence compared to those with low ARA. The presence of megarectum and neuropathy was associated with uniformly poor outcome irrespective of the IAS quality. The correlations between MWS on one hand, and ES and ARM scores for IAS on the other hand were weak in the whole study group, ES r = 0.27, P < 0.04, and ARM r = 0.39, P < 0.004. However, the correlations were strong in those who had isolated ARA without megarectum or neuropathy, ES r = 0.51, P < 0.02 and ARM r = 0.55, P < 0.01, respectively. In conclusion, the ARM and ES are valuable in evaluation of continence outcome in children after surgery for ARA and those with good quality IAS had better faecal continence. The IAS is a vital component in functional outcome in absence of neuropathy and megarectum."]}
{"question": "Continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department: are trainees learning complete surgical care?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that exemplary surgical care involves a surgeon's involvement in the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative periods. In an era of ever-expanding therapeutic modalities available to the vascular surgeon, it is important that trainees gain experience in preoperative decision-making and how this affects a patient's operative and postoperative course. The purpose of this study was to define the current experience of residents on a vascular surgery service regarding the continuity of care they are able to provide for patients and the factors affecting this experience. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and conducted at the University of British Columbia during January 2005. All patients who underwent a vascular procedure at either of the two teaching hospitals were included. In addition to type of case (emergent, outpatient, inpatient), resident demographic data and involvement in each patient's care (preoperative assessment, postoperative daily assessment, and follow-up clinic assessment) were recorded. Categoric data were analyzed with the chi2 test. RESULTS: The study included 159 cases, of which 65% were elective same-day admission patients, 20% were elective previously admitted patients; and 15% were emergent. The overall rate of preoperative assessment was 67%, involvement in the decision to operate, 17%; postoperative assessment on the ward, 79%; and patient follow-up in clinic, 3%. The rate of complete in-hospital continuity of care (assessing patient pre-op and post-op) was 57%. Emergent cases were associated with a significantly higher rate of preoperative assessment (92% vs 63%, P < .05). For elective cases admitted before the day of surgery compared with same-day admission patients, the rates of preoperative assessment (78% vs 58%, P < .05) and involvement in the decision to operate (16% vs 4%, P < .05) were significantly higher. CONCLUSIONS: The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "P001 - Sepsis impairs the capillary response within hypoxic capillaries and decreases erythrocyte oxygen-dependent ATP efflux R.

{"question": "Are environmental factors important in primary systemic vasculitis?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between primary systemic vasculitis (PSV) and environmental risk factors. METHODS: Seventy-five PSV cases and 273 controls (220 nonvasculitis, 19 secondary vasculitis, and 34 asthma controls) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Factors investigated were social class, occupational and residential history, smoking, pets, allergies, vaccinations, medications, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and farm exposure in the year before symptom onset (index year). The Standard Occupational Classification 2000 and job-exposure matrices were used to assess occupational silica, solvent, and metal exposure. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) adjusted for potential confounders. Total PSV, subgroups (47 Wegener's granulomatosis [WG], 12 microscopic polyangiitis, 16 Churg-Strauss syndrome [CSS]), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive cases were compared with control groups. RESULTS: Farming in the index year was significantly associated with PSV (OR 2.3 [95% CI 1.2-4.6]), with WG (2.7 [1.2-5.8]), with MPA (6.3 [1.9-21.6]), and with perinuclear ANCA (pANCA) (4.3 [1.5-12.7]). Farming during working lifetime was associated with PSV (2.2 [1.2-3.8]) and with WG (2.7 [1.3-5.7]). Significant associations were found for high occupational silica exposure in the index year (with PSV 3.0 [1.0-8.4], with CSS 5.6 [1.3-23.5], and with ANCA 4.9 [1.3-18.6]), high occupational solvent exposure in the index year (with PSV 3.4 [0.9-12.5], with WG 4.8 [1.2-19.8], and with classic ANCA [cANCA] 3.9 [1.6-9.5]), high occupational solvent exposure during working lifetime (with PSV 2.7 [1.1-6.6], with WG 3.4 [1.3-8.9], and with cANCA 3.3 [1.0-10.8]), drug allergy (with PSV 3.6 [1.8-7.0], with WG 4.0 [1.8-8.7], and with cANCA 4.7 [1.9-11.7]), and allergy overall (with PSV 2.2 [1.2-3.9], with WG 2.7 [1.4-5.7]). No other significant associations were found. CONCLUSION: A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, directed against constituents of granules of neutrophils and lysosomes of monocytes, are serological markers of small vessel vasculitides, including Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome and renal-limited vasculitis. These vasculitides are collectively termed ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV). Environmental factors have been considered important in the development of ANCA, including silica, infection especially with Staphylococcus aureus, and drugs. Accelerated apoptosis of neutrophils induced through intratracheal instillation of silica may act as a trigger in the development of AAV. Inhaled silica may activate alveolar macrophages and not only induce inflammation and activation of fibroblasts, but also stimulate lymphocytes through T-cell receptors and attract neutrophils. Staphylococcus aureus is associated with initiation and relapse of Wegener's granulomatosis. Peptides from complementary PR3 show strong homology with peptides from S. aureus, which could underlie the development of PR3-ANCA. There is increasing recognition that drugs, especially propylthiouracil (PTU), may cause AAV. Patients with PTU-induced AAV have better prognosis than those with primary AAV. The disease spectrum of AAV in various geographic regions is different, which may suggest that the initiating factor in AAV has a different geographical distribution. Differences in genetic background may also be important in determining the response to triggering or initiating factors.", "OBJECTIVE: The aetiopathogenesis of the primary systemic vasculitides (PSV) is unknown but includes both environmental and genetic factors. The development of classification criteria/definitions for PSV allows comparison of the epidemiology between different regions. METHODS: The same methods and the American College of Rheumatology (1990) criteria or Chapel Hill definitions were used to compare the epidemiology of Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, and polyarteritis nodosa in Norwich (east England population 413 500) and Lugo (northwest Spain population 204 100). Patients with PSV were identified between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 1998. RESULTS: Overall, the incidence of PSV in adults was almost equal in Norwich (18.9/million) and Spain (18.3/million). The incidence of Wegener's granulomatosis in Norwich (10.6/million) was greater than in Spain (4.9/million). There was a marked age-specific increase in incidence in Norwich with a peak age 65-74 years (52.9/million), but a virtually equal age distribution between ages 45 and 74 in Lugo (34.1/million). There was no significant increase with time in either population, or evidence of cyclical changes in incidence. CONCLUSION: These data support the suggestion that environmental factors may be important in the pathogenesis of PSV.", "Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) are the most common primary systemic vasculitides of the adult population, while polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a clinical syndrome often associated with GCA. Incidence and prevalence rates of AAV have been increasing in the last decades, whereas those of GCA and PMR have remained stable. The mutual interplay between environmental and genetic risk factors leading to the development of these diseases has been further analyzed in the last years. The role of infectious agents has repeatedly been studied with regard to Staphylococcus aureus, associated with relapse in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and Herpes zoster, potentially contributing to GCA development. Remission of disease and prevention of disease-related complications are the most important outcomes for all systemic vasculitides. Although these goals are achieved in the majority of patients receiving modern therapies, the prevention of treatment-related complications, especially glucocorticoid side effects, is still an unmet need that is common to AAV, GCA, and PMR.", "OBJECTIVES: The existing set of outcomes for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) needs to incorporate views of outcome measure stakeholders to meet the current standards of outcome measurement proposed by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) initiative. This study identifies domains that clinical experts (one group of stakeholders) consider to be important to determining the impact of AAV using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), a framework that describes health along four components: body functions, body structures, activities and participation, and contextual factors. METHOD: An international group of clinicians with expertise in the clinical care of patients with vasculitis were identified through consultation with three major vasculitis societies. The relevant domains were determined using a three-round e-mail-based Delphi questionnaire. RESULTS: Eighty-two clinicians were invited to participate in this study and 41 responded. Nineteen domains were identified as important by > 80% of participants: six body functions (energy, seeing, hearing, pain, respiratory, and renal function), seven body structures (peripheral nerves, eye, ear, nose, sinuses, lungs (and airways), and kidneys), three activities and participation (carrying out daily routine, remunerative employment, and recreation and leisure), and three environmental factors (medications, support and relationships, and health services, systems, and policies). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical experts focus on the physiological effects of AAV with less importance given to the effect of AAV on patients' activities and participation in life situations and the role of contextual factors. This study represents a step towards incorporating views of a range of stakeholders into disease assessment in AAV."]}
{"question": "Is low serum chloride level a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Serum chloride level is routinely assayed in clinical laboratories in the management of patients with kidney disorders and with metabolic diseases. It is a biological parameter that is easily, precisely and relatively cheaply measured. The epidemiological features of serum chloride levels have not been studied before. METHODS: For the random sample of men and women from the Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health aged 25-74 years, free of symptomatic coronary heart disease at baseline, serum chloride concentrations were measured, among those of other electrolytes. The cohort was followed up for 10 years with respect to subsequent cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: The results are based on observations of 4793 men and 4313 women. According to Cox regression analysis serum chloride level was one of the strongest predictors of total, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD mortalities independently of age, body mass index, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, levels of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, serum creatinine and serum total proteins and intake of diuretics. This relation was proved to be independent of levels of other serum electrolytes and similar for men and women. The estimated adjusted risk ratio for CVD death for subjects with a serum chloride level < or =100 mmol/l compared with those with levels above that limit was 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.06-2.57) for men and 2.16 (95% confidence interval 1.11-4.22) for women. The study of adjusted risk ratios for four groups of subjects defined on the basis of their baseline serum chloride levels revealed a decreasing log-linear 'dose-response' relation to total and cardiovascular mortalities. CONCLUSION: This s the first report from a population-based study to indicate that there is an association between serum chloride level and the incidence of total, CVD and non-CVD mortalities. The risk ratio for CVD mortality associated with a low serum chloride level was comparable to or higher than those observed for well-established CVD risk factors.", "Chloride (Cl-) is the major extracellular anion in the body, accompanying sodium (Na+), and is primarily derived from dietary sources. Data suggest that increased dietary Cl- intake increases blood pressure, yet paradoxically, higher serum Cl- appears associated with lower mortality and cardiovascular risk. This implies that serum Cl- also reflects risk pathways independent of blood pressure, serum Na+, and bicarbonate (HCO3-). We analyzed 12,968 hypertensive individuals followed up for 35 years, using Cox proportional hazards model to test whether baseline serum Cl- was an independent predictor of mortality. To distinguish the effect of Cl- from Na+ and HCO3-, we adjusted for these electrolytes and also performed the analysis stratified by Na+ /HCO3- and Cl- levels. Generalized estimating equation was used to determine the effect of baseline Cl- on follow-up blood pressure. The total time at risk was 19,7101 person-years. The lowest quintile of serum Cl- (<100 mEq/L) was associated with a 20% higher mortality (all-cause, cardiovascular and noncardiovascular) compared with the remainder of the subjects. A 1 mEq/L increase in serum Cl- was associated with a 1.5% (hazard ratio, 0.985; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-0.99) reduction in all-cause mortality, after adjustment for baseline confounding variables and Na+, K+ , and HCO3- levels. The group with Na+ > 135 and Cl- > 100 had the best survival, and compared with this group, the Na+ >135 and Cl- <100 group had significantly higher mortality (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.31). Low, not high Serum Cl- (<100 mEq/L), is associated with greater mortality risk independent of obvious confounders. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relation between Cl- and risk.", "BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of serum chloride among patients with heart failure was demonstrated by previous studies. However, the association of serum chloride and risk of cardiovascular mortality among the general population remains unclear. METHODS: We included 16,483 participants in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of serum sodium and chloride and cardiovascular mortality. Potential confounders were included in the models. Levels of serum sodium and chloride were also modeled with restrictive cubic splines for potential nonlinear associations. Subgroup analyses were based on baseline diseases and use of diuretics. RESULTS: The mean age was 43.5 years, and 47.8% of the participants were men. During 277,059 person-years of follow-up, there were 1714 cardiovascular deaths. In the multivariate model, low-level serum sodium was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.18 per standard deviation [SD]; P = 0.009), whereas a lower level of serum chloride was not (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.12 per standard deviation; P = 0.278). Analyses with restrictive cubic splines yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Low serum sodium, rather than chloride, was independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality.", "BACKGROUND: Serum chloride levels were recently found to be independently associated with mortality in heart failure (HF). METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the relationship between serum chloride and clinical outcomes in 7195 subjects with acute myocardial infarction complicated by reduced left ventricular function and HF. The studied outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for HF. Both chloride and sodium had a nonlinear association with the studied outcomes (P<0.05 for linearity). Patients in the lowest chloride tertile (chloride </=100) were older, had more comorbidities, and had lower sodium levels (P<0.05 for all). Serum chloride showed a significant interaction with sodium with regard to all studied outcomes (P for interaction <0.05 for all). The lowest chloride tertile (</=100 mmol/L) was associated with increased mortality rates in the context of lower sodium (</=138 mmol/L; adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] for all-cause mortality=1.42 (1.14-1.77); P=0.002), whereas in the context of higher sodium levels (>141 mmol/L), the association with mortality was lost. Spline-transformed chloride and its interaction with sodium did not add significant prognostic information on top of other well-established prognostic variables (P>0.05 for all outcomes). CONCLUSIONS: In post-myocardial infarction with systolic dysfunction and HF, low serum chloride was associated with mortality (but not hospitalization for HF) in the setting of lower sodium. Overall, chloride and its interaction with sodium did not add clinically relevant prognostic information on top of other well-established prognostic variables. Taken together, these data support an integrated and critical consideration of chloride and sodium interplay.", "BACKGROUND: Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly dysnatremia, are independent predictors of adverse outcome in individuals with and without renal failure. However, the association of serum chloride level (Cl(-)) with mortality or risk of cardiovascular (CV) events in chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains unclear. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 923 pre-dialysis CKD G2-G5 patients among the participants of the CKD Research of Outcomes in Treatment and Epidemiology (CKD-ROUTE) study, who newly visited 16 nephrology centers. The primary outcome was a composite of overall death and CV events, and the secondary outcome was overall death. Data were analyzed using the Cox hazards model with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Median Cl(-) was 106.0 mEq/L at enrollment [quartile (Q) 1: </=103.9, n =  207; Q2: 104.0-105.9, n =  207; Q3: 106.0-108.0, n =  289; Q4: >/=108.1, n = 220]. During a median follow-up of 33 months, there were 98 CV events, 66 deaths, and 154 composite outcomes. The hazard ratio (HR) for the composite outcome was higher for Q1 than Q3 [HR 1.72; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.08-2.72; P =  0.022]. As a continuous variable in a subset of patients whose Cl(-) was </=106.0 mEq/L, higher Cl(-) was associated with lower risk of the composite outcome (HR 0.93; 95 % CI 0.87-0.99; P = 0.023). HR for all-cause mortality was also higher for Q1 than Q3 (HR 2.48; 95 % CI 1.22-5.03; P =  0.012). CONCLUSION: Low Cl(-) was associated with increased mortality and risk of CV events in pre-dialysis CKD patients. Cl(-) may be an additional prognostic indicator in CKD."]}
{"question": "Is EQ-5D a valid quality of life instrument in patients with acute coronary syndrome?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To analyze the construct validity of the EQ-5D in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). METHODS: All ACS-diagnosed patients discharged from a university-affiliated hospital during a 3-year period were mailed a questionnaire that included the EQ-5D and the SF-8. The EQ-5D includes a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) to measure self-reported current health-status (0-100) and a five-item descriptive system measuring mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Also included were disease severity measures [Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), cardiac symptom count (SC), patient-perceived cardiac disease severity], comorbidity measures (Charlson comorbidity index, total medication count), and other demographic and disease-related items. RESULTS: Of 1217 patients, 490 (40.3%) responded. Patients averaged 65.2 (SD 11.3) years of age; 71.0% male; 91.9% Caucasian; 64.3% history of MI. Only 0.2%-0.4% of EQ-5D items and 8% of the EQ VAS were left unanswered by respondents. The nine most common health states were identified based on the five EQ-5D item scores. Levels of responses to EQ-5D items and the EQ VAS score were significantly better for patients with very mild/mild perceived disease severity compared to severe/very severe, for patients with lower comorbidity, for patients with lower symptom responses, and for patients with a higher cardiac-related functioning. EQ VAS score and SF-8 subscale score correlation coefficients ranged from 0.527 to 0.798 (all p < 0.0001). Significant differences were observed between the response level of individual EQ-5D items and scores of comparable SF-8 subscales. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the construct validity of the EQ-5D in a population-based sample of patients with a history of ACS.", "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the construct validity of the Turkish version of the EQ-5D in patients with acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study at the Trakya University Hospital between February and May 2008. All patients completed the Turkish version of the EQ-5D and MacNew heart-related quality of life scale. Construct validity of the EQ-5D was assessed according to relationships with MacNew subscales by using Spearman rank correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-two patients responded to the instruments. Mean age was 62.9+/-9.3 years and male gender (88 or 72.1%) was dominant. Mean score of the EQ-5D index was 0.79+/-0.32, while the global score of MacNew was 5.01+/-1.16. The correlation coefficients of the EQ-5D index score with the MacNew subscales ranged from 0.557 to 0.721, with EQ-5D VAS score ranging from 0.297 to 0.484 (p<0.001 for all of them). According to the stepwise regression model MacNew global score was found to be significantly effective factor on EQ-5D index score (beta =0.188; 95% CI: 0.152-0.224; p<0.001).

{"question": "Out of the smokescreen II: will an advertisement targeting the tobacco industry affect young people's perception of smoking in movies and their intention to smoke?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an antismoking advertisement on young people's perceptions of smoking in movies and their intention to smoke. SUBJECTS/SETTING: 3091 cinema patrons aged 12-24 years in three Australian states; 18.6% of the sample (n = 575) were current smokers. DESIGN/INTERVENTION: Quasi-experimental study of patrons, surveyed after having viewed a movie. The control group was surveyed in week 1, and the intervention group in weeks 2 and 3. Before seeing the movie in weeks 2 and 3, a 30 s antismoking advertisement was shown, shot in the style of a movie trailer that warned patrons not to be sucked in by the smoking in the movie they were about to see. OUTCOMES: Attitude of current smokers and non-smokers to smoking in the movies; intention of current smokers and non-smokers to smoke in 12 months. RESULTS: Among non-smokers, 47.8% of the intervention subjects thought that the smoking in the viewed movie was not OK compared with 43.8% of the control subjects (p = 0.04). However, there was no significant difference among smokers in the intervention (16.5%) and control (14.5%) groups (p = 0.4). A higher percentage of smokers in the intervention group indicated that they were likely to be smoking in 12 months time (38.6%) than smokers in the control group (25.6%; p<0.001). For non-smokers, there was no significant difference in smoking intentions between groups, with 1.2% of intervention subjects and 1.6% of controls saying that they would probably be smoking in 12 months time (p = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: This real-world study suggests that placing an antismoking advertisement before movies containing smoking scenes can help to immunise non-smokers against the influences of film stars' smoking. Caution must be exercised in the type of advertisement screened as some types of advertising may reinforce smokers' intentions to smoke."]}
{"question": "Do adjuvant aromatase inhibitors increase the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer?", "retrieved_passages": ["Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the developed world for both men and women. Women experience significant alterations in lipid profiles during the years following menopause, including a reduction in plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an elevation of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and are at an increased risk of CVD. These changes are due in part to the reduction in estrogen production following the onset of the menopause. Therefore, agents that have anti-estrogenic effects, such as most endocrine therapies for breast cancer, may increase the risk of CVD. Tamoxifen, historically the standard endocrine therapy, has an overall beneficial effect on lipid profiles. However, long-term data from clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective effect and patients treated with tamoxifen did not experience fewer cardiovascular events compared with those receiving placebo. Indeed, a number of studies have shown that tamoxifen may have a detrimental effect, with a significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolic events, pulmonary embolism and stroke. The third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have demonstrated an improvement in efficacy and tolerability over previous treatments. Since they have a different mechanism of action to tamoxifen, they are not anticipated to exert the same impact on lipid profiles. Clinical trials with anastrozole demonstrated no clinically relevant impact on lipid profiles in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. However, as lipid profiles are surrogate endpoints, the most appropriate endpoint is the incidence of cardiovascular events in long-term studies. This is of particular relevance in the treatment of early breast cancer, where endocrine agents may be used in the adjuvant setting for periods of 5 years or more. Long-term adjuvant anastrozole treatment resulted in significantly fewer thromboembolic and cerebrovascular events and a similar incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events compared with tamoxifen. The effects of the other AIs on lipid levels are variable, and any correlation with cardiovascular events is currently unknown.", "BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) may increase cardiovascular risk relative to tamoxifen in post-menopausal women with breast cancer. This risk has not been well-quantified outside of clinical trials. METHODS: Observational population-based cohort study of women aged >55 years diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer between 2005 and 2010. Women treated with AIs or tamoxifen were followed to March 2012. The primary outcome was hospitalisation for myocardial infarction (MI). Cause-specific hazards were compared using tamoxifen as the reference group. Inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score was used to reduce confounding due to measured baseline covariates. Results were confirmed using two cause-specific hazards models. Subgroup analyses included women aged >/=66 years, those with prior ischaemic heart disease, and a 'lower-risk group' aged <74 years with stage I-II cancer and no prior ischaemic heart disease. RESULTS: In 7409 aromatase inhibitor-treated and 1941 tamoxifen-treated women, the median age was 71 versus 74 years, respectively (p < 0.001). Baseline prevalence of ischaemic heart disease was similar (17.0% versus 16.9%, p = 0.96). Over a mean of 1184 d of follow-up, there were 123 hospitalisations for MI; the cause-specific hazard was higher with AIs (hazard ratio 2.02; 95% confidence interval 1.16-3.53 in the weighted sample). We observed comparable patterns within pre-defined subgroups and when adjusted using cause-specific hazards models. CONCLUSION: Aromatase inhibitors are associated with a higher risk of MI compared with tamoxifen. This risk should be accounted for when managing aromatase inhibitor-treated women.", "Third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are now being used for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with breast cancer, and are challenging tamoxifen, the previous 'gold standard' of care, in this setting. This review evaluates the potential clinical impact of anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane on the cardiovascular (CV) system of postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Some data for CV safety are available for AIs from the advanced disease setting; however, most derive from patients being treated for early disease. CV data on anastrozole for the treatment of early breast cancer were taken from the ATAC trial, in which anastrozole was compared with tamoxifen in the primary adjuvant setting, and the ABCSG trial 8/ARNO 95 combined analysis, in which switching to 3 years of anastrozole after 2 years of tamoxifen was compared with the standard 5 years of tamoxifen adjuvant therapy. Letrozole has been studied in the primary adjuvant setting and the adjuvant sequencing setting in the BIG 1-98 study, as well as in extended adjuvant endocrine therapy after 5 years of tamoxifen in the MA-17 trial. For exemestane, results were reviewed from the IES trial, in which switching to exemestane following 2-3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen was compared with continued tamoxifen treatment. All these trials clearly confirmed that all three AIs significantly reduce the risk of thromboembolic events compared with tamoxifen. Data on anastrozole versus tamoxifen from the ATAC trial (68 months' follow-up) showed a similar incidence of myocardial infarctions (MIs), CV deaths and overall deaths for both therapies; however, anastrozole appeared to be associated with a lower incidence of cerebrovascular events compared with tamoxifen. In addition, the ABCSG trial 8/ARNO 95 study reported no difference in terms of MIs for patients switching to anastrozole compared with patients continuing tamoxifen treatment. Data from BIG 1-98 (26 months' follow-up) suggested that primary adjuvant treatment with letrozole may be associated with a significantly greater incidence of CV events and a numerical increase of cerebrovascular and cardiac deaths compared with tamoxifen. However, no increase in CV events with letrozole was reported from the MA-17 trial. In the IES, updated data at 55 months' median follow up showed no significant difference in the incidence of MIs and cardiac deaths between patients who switched to exemestane compared with those who continued tamoxifen. In conclusion, a significantly reduced risk of thromboembolic disease was observed for all three AIs compared with tamoxifen. Anastrozole is, at this point, the only AI with a detailed benefit-risk profile from over 5 years' follow-up in the adjuvant setting. Thus far, no apparent CV-safety concerns have emerged. Preliminary data on letrozole and exemestane suggest that longer follow-up is needed for these two AIs before being able to fully assess their respective long-term CV toxicity profile. The present differences in CV-safety profiles suggest that third-generation AIs should not be considered as equivalents in clinical practice.", "Adjuvant systemic therapies for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer (EBC) effectively treat the tumor and significantly decrease the risk for recurrence. However, some of these treatments are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events. Cardiovascular complications related to cancer therapy may be a prominent concern in postmenopausal women with existing cardiovascular disease or in those who are at high risk for developing cardiovascular disease. The increased risk for cardiac toxicity in women receiving radiation, anthracyclines, and/or trastuzumab for the adjuvant treatment of EBC is well established. The risk of thromboembolic disease is higher in patients with estrogen receptor-positive EBC receiving tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting, whether it is given before or instead of an aromatase inhibitor. In addition, while available data suggest no substantial differences in the risk for ischemic cardiovascular events between aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen, investigation is still ongoing. Based on this information, it is important for health care providers to understand the cardiovascular risks of treatment and how to monitor at-risk patients, particularly when multiple agents are used in combination or in succession. Improving cardiovascular outcomes in patients with EBC requires cardiovascular risk assessment, management, and long-term follow-up care. Because of the multimodal treatment of EBC patients, their care requires a multidisciplinary approach to reduce not only the risk for breast cancer recurrence but also the risk for treatment-related cardiac toxicities.", "BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are recommended as adjuvant treatment for estrogen-receptor positive breast carcinoma in postmenopausal women. Studies demonstrate mixed results as to the impact of AIs on cardiovascular (CV) events and overall survival. With the increasing number of pre- and postmenopausal women on AIs for five to ten years, understanding the long-term impact of AIs on blood vessels and CV risk in cancer survivors is vital. METHODS: A single arm longitudinal study of 14 postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer prescribed adjuvant AIs at the University of Minnesota. Subjects with a history of tobacco use, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia were excluded. Participants underwent routine labs, blood pressure assessments, and vascular testing at baseline (prior to starting AIs) and at six months. Vascular assessment was performed using the EndoPAT 2000 and HDI/PulseWave CR-2000 Cardiovascular Pro ling System and pulse contour analysis on two occasions as previously described. Vascular measurements were conducted by one trained vascular technician. Assessments were performed in triplicate, and the mean indices were used for analyses. All subjects were on an AI at the follow-up visit. The protocol was approved by the UMN Institutional Review Board and all participants were provided written informed consent. Baseline and follow-up characteristics were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Analyses were performed using R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). RESULTS: After six months of AI treatment, EndoPAT((R)) ratio declined to a median 1.12 (Q1: 0.85, Q3: 1.86; p=0.045) and median estradiol levels decreased to 2 pg/mL (Q1: 2, Q3: 3; p=0.052). There was no evidence of association between change in EndoPAT((R)) and change in estradiol level (p=0.91). There were no statistically significant changes in small or large arterial elasticity. CONCLUSION: Endovascular dysfunction is an early sign for atherosclerosis and vascular impairment. This study suggests that postmenopausal breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitor therapy develop endothelial dysfunction as early as six months which is a predictor of adverse CV disease. We hypothesize that long-term use of AIs can lead to persistent endothelial dysfunction. It is unclear if these changes are reversible once AI use is discontinued and further investigation is necessary."]}
{"question": "Metastatic carcinoma to the cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary site: Is there a need for neck dissection?", "retrieved_passages": ["The development of metastatic carcinoma in cervical lymph nodes is a relatively common syndrome. In most patients, meticulous evaluation of the head and neck area and the lungs will identify a primary tumor site. FNA biopsy of the cervical lymph nodes is the recommended initial biopsy technique; open biopsy should be withheld until after a search for the head and neck primary tumor site is completed. In the patient with no identified primary tumor site, prognosis depends on the site and extent of neck involvement. Because comparative trials have not been performed, conclusions regarding optimal therapy must be made by inference from existing data. Patients with N1 disease located in the upper or midcervical lymph nodes have a relatively high cure rate and can usually be treated with a single local treatment modality (radiation therapy or radical neck dissection). Patients with N2 or N3 disease are probably best treated with combined local modalities including surgical resection followed by radiation therapy. Most investigators have recommended high-dose radiation therapy as is used to treat squamous cancer of the head and neck, with inclusion of those areas in the head and neck that may harbor an occult primary tumor site. Limited data exists regarding the benefit of systemic therapy added to local therapy in these patients. However, treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil before definitive local therapy is reasonable in patients with N3 disease, who have very poor prognoses with local modalities alone.", "BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes and patterns of failure in patients with metastatic carcinoma to cervical lymph nodes from an unknown head and neck primary origin, who were treated curatively with radiotherapy, with or without neck dissection. METHODS: The study included 61 patients referred to the McGill University Hospital Centers from 1987 to 2002. The median age was 57 years, with male to female ratio of 4:1. Distribution of patients by N status was as follows: N1, 16 patients (26%); N2a, 18 (30%); N2b, 13 (22%); N2c, 7 (11%); and N3, 7 (11%). Twenty patients underwent neck dissection (11 radical, 9 functional) and 41 patients had biopsy (9 fine-needle aspiration and 32 excisional biopsy). All patients received radiotherapy. The median dose to the involved node(s) was 64 Gy, and 60 Gy to the rest of the neck. Treatment of the neck was bilateral in 50 patients (82%) and ipsilateral in 11 (18%). The minimum duration of the follow-up was 12 months, with the median of 32 months. RESULTS: The 5- and 8-year overall survival for the whole population was 79% and 67%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the 8-year actuarial overall survival (64.8% and 67.6%, respectively, p = .64) and local relapse-free survival (75% vs 74.5%, respectively, p = .57), among patients who had biopsy versus those who had neck dissection. CONCLUSION: In our experience, definitive radiotherapy to the neck and the potential mucosal sites, whether preceded by neck dissection or not, is effective to achieve a good local control rate in the unknown primary cancer of the head and neck. The indication for neck dissection, in particular for early nodal stage, is controversial.", "Metastatic cervical carcinoma from an unknown primary source poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, as it involves the spread of cancer to the neck lymph nodes without a discernible primary tumor despite thorough investigation. While the diagnosis and treatment of this uncommon condition lack definitive evidence, a review of existing literature offers some clinical guidance. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, which includes multiple imaging and endoscopic studies, is essential. Surgery is preferred whenever feasible due to its ability to offer more precise staging. This treatment entails an excisional biopsy, neck dissection, and tonsillectomy, but advanced cases necessitate a combination of treatments. This case report underscores this complexity, where, despite radical neck dissection on the affected side, recurrence manifested after two months with no discernible primary site. We emphasize the urgency for continued research and innovative approaches to enhance the diagnosis and management of metastatic cervical carcinoma from an unknown primary source.", "Carcinoma of unknown primary of the neck (CUP) is a metastasis presenting in one or more cervical lymph nodes, with no primary mucosal site identified. Retrospective case notes review of 25 consecutive patients (median age 55, 72% males) diagnosed as CUP who underwent neck dissection in a UK tertiary referral comprehensive cancer centre between 2000 and 2011. Median follow-up was 33 months. Nineteen patients underwent comprehensive neck dissections (six extended), six patients had selective neck dissection. Five year disease specific survival and regional recurrence free survival were 76 and 80% respectively. The overall rate of occult disease (disease not identified on preoperative evaluation, but found on histopathologic examination) was 8%, with rates of 0% in level I and 6% in level V. Our study suggests that in patients without preoperative evidence of disease in levels I or V selective neck dissection might be considered as an option, to facilitate preservation of the submandibular gland and accessory nerve without compromising oncological outcome. Larger studies should be performed before a change in practice can be advised.", "A patient is diagnosed with an unknown primary of the head and neck when metastatic disease is present in the cervical lymph node or nodes and no primary lesion is detected by thorough physical examination, directed biopsies of suspicious or most likely primary sites, and imaging studies. The optimal management of patients who have this syndrome is still unclear and controversial. We report our results and analysis of the management of 24 patients with this syndrome. From 1976 through 1992, 24 patients who had metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cervical lymph nodes were seen in our medical center. A thorough search did not detect a primary lesion in any of them. Patients underwent radical neck dissection of the involved neck; 23 had unilateral and I had bilateral neck disease. Postoperative radiotherapy was delivered to both sides of the neck and to the potential primary mucosal and submucosal sites. The relation between clinical N stage, histologic findings of numerous involved lymph nodes, presence of extracapsular tumor extension, and survival were statistically analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the survival analysis. The p values of log-rank test for the comparison of the two groups 1) N1 and N2 versus N3, and 2) presence of extracapsular tumor extension versus its absence are less than 0.005, with extracapsular tumor extension versus nonextracapsular tumor extension slightly smaller. The 5- and 10-year disease-free survival rate for the entire group was 54.2% (70.5% for N1 and N2, and 14.2% for N3). Three patients had locoregional failure, two in the primary sites, one in the nasopharynx, and the other in the oropharynx (the latter also had recurrent disease in the undissected neck). In 8 patients, distant metastases developed 7 to 38 months after radiotherapy. All 11 patients (45.8%) who had recurrent disease had advanced clinical N stage, microscopic findings of numerous involved lymph nodes, and prominent extracapsular tumor extension to the surrounding soft tissue and blood vessels. The high incidence of distant metastases shortly after treatment suggests a hematogenous spread before treatment in patients who had extensive nodal and extranodal disease. Our long-term disease-free survival beyond ten years seems to indicate combined treatment modalities, including radical neck dissection with postoperative radiotherapy of the neck, and the potential primary site in patients with N2 and N3 disease (our N1 group is too small for analysis). Further improvement of cure rate can be expected in the future with early detection and treatment."]}
{"question": "Cardiac reoperations in octogenarians: Do they really benefit?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The benefit of cardiac surgery in octogenarians is well described. Today, nearly every second patient who undergoes cardiac surgery is older than 70 years. The time between primary cardiac surgery and reoperation is 7 to 13 years. Therefore, in the future we can expect to see an increasing number of reoperations in octogenarians. METHODS: We studied 71 patients (41 male) with a mean age of 83 +/- 2.8 years, who underwent cardiac reoperation between 1994 and 2006. These patients were compared with 71 octogenarians who underwent primary cardiac operation. Patients were matched for age, sex, year of operation, and surgical procedure. Demographic profiles, operative data, long-term survival, and quality of life by the Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey questionnaire were analyzed. RESULTS: Average time between previous operation and reoperation was 10.8 +/- 5.6 years (range: 1.7 to 30.6). The 30-day mortality rate was 14.7% in the reoperation group and 8.5% (p = 0.43) in the control group. Actuarial survival at 1, 3, and 6 years was 71% +/- 5.5%, 60.5% +/- 6.1%, and 30% +/- 8.1% for patients who underwent cardiac reoperation; and 77.2% +/- 5%, 58.3% +/- 6.3%, and 36.3% +/- 7.8% for matched octogenarians who underwent primary cardiac surgery (p = 0.68). No significant differences were found between groups regarding the physical health summarized score (40.7 +/- 9.4 versus 39.1 +/- 10; p = 0.55) and the mental health summarized score (51.9 +/- 10.9 versus 48 +/- 12.9; p = 0.24) of the Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Octogenarians exhibit a similar long-term survival and quality of life after primary and redo cardiac surgery. Therefore, cardiac reoperation should not be a contraindication per se in octogenarians.", "AIM: According to the demographic development of our society, the numbers of octogenarians referred to cardiac surgery are continuously growing. Although the benefit of first-time cardiac procedures for these patients is well documented, the fate of octogenarians after redo-procedures, with special regard to long-term survival, functional status and quality of life, is poorly investigated. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 84 consecutive patients aged >/=80 years, who underwent a cardiac reoperation at the department for Cardiothoracic Surgery in the Heart & Vessel Center Bad Bevensen between January 2007 and 2013. Demographic profiles as well as operative data were analyzed, and the patients were prospectively followed. Patient's functional status and quality of life were assessed with the Barthel Index, New York Heart Association class and the short form-12 questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age of the study group (61 men, 23 women) was 81.9 +/- 1.9 years. Most redo-procedures were carried out after primary coronary artery bypass grafting (65%), primary aortic valve replacement (21%) and primary mitral valve replacement (6%). The most frequent actual surgical procedures were combined coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement (26%), isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (19%), and isolated aortic valve replacement (19%). The mean length of hospital stay was 17 +/- 15 days. In-hospital mortality counted for 32.1%. During follow up (29 +/- 20 months) a further 19.0% of the patients died. The Barthel Index of the survivors was 89 +/- 17 and their mean New York Heart Association class was 2 +/- 1. A total of 93% of the patients were living at home. Summary scores of physical and mental health of the short form-12 questionnaire equalled those of an age- and sex-matched normative population. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life.

These demographic changes are reflected in an increasing number of octogenarians with advanced symptomatic disease undergoing complex cardiac intervention. We reviewed data from 62 articles on cardiac surgery in octogenarians. The medical and ethical issues involved in making the decision are complex. Long-term results of cardiac surgery in octogenarians show that these patients can withstand heart surgery with improved functional benefit and quality of life. Surgery is beneficial especially for patients undergoing coronary artery revascularization or isolated aortic valve surgery. The operative course in octogenarians is more complicated, which is reflected in longer postoperative hospitalization. In refutation of the assumption that mortality in octogenarians is related to multisystem failure, most deaths are cardiac in nature. Highly selective criteria (identifying risks and benefits individually) should be applied to octogenarians undergoing cardiac surgery to achieve a satisfactory result.", "BACKGROUND: Patients aged 80 years and older who require cardiac surgical procedures are an increasing population and usually present with considerable comorbidity. Detailed operative risk stratification versus long-term survival and quality of life after surgery is mandatory. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,003 patients aged 82.3 years (range, 80 to 94 years) who underwent aortic valve replacement (n = 303), coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 403), or aortic valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 297) between 1987 and 2006. Preoperative data, operative outcome, long-term survival, and predictors for early and late mortality were analyzed. Furthermore, the Short Form 36 Health Status questionnaire was used to evaluate the quality of life. RESULTS: Overall in-hospital mortality was 7.1%. Overall actuarial survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 81.6% +/- 1.2%, 60.4% +/- 1.9%, and 23.3% +/- 2.6% (mean survival time, 6.25 +/- 0.2 years) and showed no significant difference compared with an age- and sex-matched general population. Multivariate analysis showed that preoperative creatinine concentration greater than 1.3 mg/dL (p < 0.001), preoperative atrial fibrillation (p < 0.005), and postoperative prolonged ventilation (p < 0.001) were independent predictors for poor long-term survival. The physical health summarized score of the Short Form 36 Health Status questionnaire was significantly increased in the study population compared with a German standard population aged 80 years and older (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite an increased operative mortality, octogenarians showed a considerable quality of life and an excellent long-term survival. To further improve surgical outcome in octogenarians, patient selection should be done with consideration of the identified independent preoperative risk factors.", "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study was to review recent literature reporting the results of coronary revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients older than 80 years. RECENT FINDINGS: The review of recent studies on octogenarians demonstrates a surgical CABG advantage in the case of patients with increasing baseline coronary risk, such as severe multivessel disease, chronic total occlusions, and left ventricular dysfunction. PCI seems to be more appropriate for less severe degree and distribution of coronary lesions, and for subgroups of patients with higher surgical risk, such as acute coronary syndromes, reoperations, malignancy, dementia, poor mobility, frailty, and serious comorbidities contraindicating extracorporeal circulation. SUMMARY: It is not the case that CABG is indicated only when there are contraindications to PCI. CABG confers more benefit than PCI in patients with increasing baseline cardiac risk, in the absence of serious systemic diseases that can reasonably reduce their life expectancy.CABG and PCI, with proper selection, should be considered complementary rather than competitive procedures in the therapy of octogenarians affected by coronary artery disease."]}
{"question": "Location and number of sutures placed for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding: does it matter?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that hiatal hernia repair (HHR) during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) decreases the rate of reoperation. However, the technical aspects (location and number of sutures) are not standardized. It is unknown whether such technical details are associated with differing rates of reoperation for band-related problems. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed from a single institution, including 2,301 patients undergoing LAGB with HHR from July 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. Independent variables were number and location of sutures. Data collected included demographics, operating room (OR) time, length of stay (LOS), follow-up time, postoperative BMI/%EWL, and rates of readmission/reoperation. Statistical analyses included ANOVA and Chi squared tests. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox regression tests were used for follow-up data and reoperation rates, in order to account for differential length of follow-up and confounding variables. RESULTS: There was no difference in length of follow-up among all groups. The majority of patients had one suture (range 1-6; 55 %). Patients with fewer sutures had shorter OR time (1 suture 45 min vs. 4+ sutures 56 min, p < 0.0001). LOS, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postop BMI/%EWL were not statistically significant. Anterior suture placement (vs. posterior vs. both) was most common (61 %). OR time was shorter in those with anterior suture (41 min vs. posterior 56 min vs. both 59 min, p < 0.0001). Patients with posterior suture had a longer LOS (84 % 1 day vs. anterior 74 % 1 day vs. both 74 % 1 day, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative BMI/%EWL. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary."]}
{"question": "Surgical treatment of prosthetic valve endocarditis in patients with double prostheses: is single-valve replacement safe?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Bias against operating on patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) who have multiple prostheses may preclude the use of life-saving valve replacement. We investigated the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of PVE in patients with both mitral and aortic prosthesis and the safety of single-valve replacement when only one valve seemed infected. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of active PVE who had mitral and aortic prosthesis in place were assessed. We looked at the methods for diagnosis, causative agents, indication for valve replacement, operative findings and outcome. RESULTS: Twenty patients, who had both mitral and aortic prostheses and a diagnosis of PVE, were assessed. Streptococci and staphylococci caused 70% of cases. By means of echocardiography, the valves involved were: mitral (11 patients), aortic (six patients), and in three cases both prosthetic valves seemed infected. Surgery was undertaken in 17 patients (85%). The positive predictive value of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for the preoperative diagnosis of the site of infection was 100%. In 13 patients, only the prosthetic valve that seemed infected was replaced. Four of these patients died within a week after the procedure. Nine patients survived the surgical procedure, completed a course of antimicrobial therapy and were followed up for 15.78 months (95% CI: 12.83-18.72). All were considered cured and relapses were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses."]}
{"question": "Epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis: a risky technique?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To evaluate epidural analgesia role after cytoreductive surgery with peritonectomy combined with heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy. METHODS: 101 patients were retrospectively studied (between 2008 and 2012) to evaluate epidural analgesia effectiveness, tolerability and safety in this surgical context through the assessment of pain, detection of adverse events (nausea, vomiting, itching), temporary motor block, respiratory failure and coagulation profile in the post-operative period. RESULTS: The median duration of epidural analgesia was 5 [range 1-10] days. As regards pain relief, the median verbal numerical scale scores at rest and on movement were below 2 and 5 until the fifth post-operative day, respectively. 13% of patients suffered nausea, 4% vomit, and 1% itching. No bradycardia or respiratory failure event was reported. 9.9% of patients had hypotension episodes. Coagulation reached normality only 3-4 days after surgery. 5 risky accidental dislodgments of epidural catheter occurred (prothrombine time INR > 1.5) without neurological complications. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural analgesia ensures adequate pain relief and is well tolerated by patients after cytoreductive surgery with peritonectomy combined with heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Hypotension is common in this context and careful monitoring of coagulation parameters, especially in the first 3 days after surgery, is advisable to reduce the risk of neuraxial complications.", "BACKGROUND: To study the risks of haemodynamic instability, and the possible occurrence of spinal haematoma, meningitis and epidural abscess when epidural analgesia is performed for cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 35 patients treated by HIPEC with oxaliplatin or cisplatin. An epidural catheter was inserted before induction of general anaesthesia. Postoperatively, a continuous epidural infusion of ropivacain, then a patient-controlled epidural analgesia were started. RESULTS: The epidural catheter was used peroperatively before HIPEC in 12 subjects (34%), and after HIPEC in 23 subjects (66%). The median dose of ropivacain given peroperatively in the epidural catheter was 40 mg (30-75). Norepinephrin was used in two subjects (6%) peroperatively (median infusion rate 0.325 mug/kg per minute [0.32-0.33]), and in four subjects (11%) in the postoperative 24 hours. No spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess were noted. Five subjects (14%) had a thrombopenia or a prothrombin time less than 60% before catheter removal. Two subjects (6%) had a leukopenia before catheter removal. No thrombopenia or blood coagulation disorders were recorded the day of catheter removal. CONCLUSION: In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines."]}
{"question": "Risk stratification in emergency surgical patients: is the APACHE II score a reliable marker of physiological impairment?", "retrieved_passages": ["HYPOTHESES: The APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score used as an intensive care unit (ICU) admission score in emergency surgical patients is not independent of the effects of treatment and might lead to considerable bias in the comparability of defined groups of patients and in the evaluation of treatment policies. Postoperative monitoring with the APACHE II score is clinically irrelevant. DESIGN: Inception cohort study. SETTING: Secondary referral center. PATIENTS: Eighty-five consecutive emergency surgical patients admitted to the surgical ICU in 1999. The APACHE II score was calculated before surgery; after admission to the ICU; and on postoperative days 3, 7, and 10. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: APACHE II scores and predicted and observed mortality rates. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD APACHE II score of 24.2 +/- 8.3 at admission to the ICU was approximately 36% greater than the initial APACHE II score of 17.8 +/- 7.7, a difference that was highly statistically significant (P<.001). The overall mortality of 32% favorably corresponds with the predicted mortality of 34% according to the initial APACHE II score. However, the predicted mortality of 50% according to the APACHE II score at admission to the ICU was significantly different from the observed mortality rate (P =.02). In 40 long-term patients (>/=10 days in the ICU), the difference between the APACHE II scores of survivors and patients who died was statistically significant on day 10 (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS: For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient."]}
{"question": "Are physicians meeting the needs of family caregivers of the frail elderly?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To explore expressed needs, both formal and informal, of family caregivers of frail elderly. To evaluate roles of physicians. DESIGN: Questionnaire survey of members of the Montreal Jewish community providing care for frail elderly family members. SETTING: Jewish community of Montreal. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer caregivers who were caring for a family member or friend 60 years or older, who had greatest responsibility for providing physical or emotional support to an elderly person, who saw themselves as caregivers, and who could speak English or French were studied. Of 118 volunteers, 32 were excluded because they withdrew for personal reasons or because they did not meet study criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic variables, functional status of the care receiver, use of home care services, and needs assessment to identify additional services. RESULTS: An average of 75.4% respondents did not use formal support services. Just under half of caregivers were dissatisfied with the attention they received from the health care system, and more than one third expressed feelings of stress, depression, guilt, and isolation. CONCLUSIONS: Hypotheses for this discontent are presented. Physicians may be uninterested in helping caregivers; even if they were receptive to counseling caregivers, they could be poorly remunerated for the types of counseling sessions that are usual for caregivers; and being a professional caregiver to family caregivers is demanding in itself.", "The current US healthcare system, focused mostly on acute and episodic care, has difficulty meeting the needs of ill, frail elderly and their families or other caregivers. Because of their low mobility and complex medical conditions, these \"oldest old\" patients and their families or caregivers must make frequent, difficult, and expensive trips to multiple physicians to receive care. The result is that the frail elderly most often receive delayed or crisis care rather than timely primary care. To address these and other needs, a coordinated approach to the care of the oldest old requires a new model that includes primary medical care in the home. This article discusses how the Medical House Call Program (MHCP) model can provide high-quality primary healthcare to the frail elderly at home, improve the continuity of care between the home and the hospital, provide support and education to families or caregivers, and provide linkage to a broad range of social and supportive services in the community. The MHCP model is one of a number of evolving for-profit and nonprofit approaches that seek to provide medical care in the home. This article also discusses how the MHCP model, working with oncology physicians and programs, can have similar benefits and applications for the growing number of elderly cancer patients and their families or caregivers.", "BACKGROUND: Frail elderly people need an integrated and coordinated care. The two-armed study \"Continuum of care for frail elderly people\" is a multi-professional and multidimensional intervention for frail community-dwelling elderly people. It was designed to evaluate whether the intervention programme for frail elderly people can reduce the number of visits to hospital, increase satisfaction with health and social care and maintain functional abilities. The implementation process is explored and analysed along with the intervention. In this paper we present the study design, the intervention and the outcome measures as well as the baseline characteristics of the study participants. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomised two-armed controlled trial with follow ups at 3, 6 and 12 months. The study group includes elderly people who sought care at the emergency ward and discharged to their own homes in the community. Inclusion criteria were 80 years and older or 65 to 79 years with at least one chronic disease and dependent in at least one activity of daily living. Exclusion criteria were acute severely illness with an immediate need of the assessment and treatment by a physician, severe cognitive impairment and palliative care. The intention was that the study group should comprise a representative sample of frail elderly people at a high risk of future health care consumption. The intervention includes an early geriatric assessment, early family support, a case manager in the community with a multi-professional team and the involvement of the elderly people and their relatives in the planning process. DISCUSSION: The design of the study, the randomisation procedure and the protocol meetings were intended to ensure the quality of the study. The implementation of the intervention programme is followed and analysed throughout the whole study, which enables us to generate knowledge on the process of implementing complex interventions. The intervention contributes to early recognition of both the elderly peoples' needs of information, care and rehabilitation and of informal caregivers' need of support and information. This study is expected to show positive effects on frail elderly peoples' health care consumption, functional abilities and satisfaction with health and social care.

{"question": "Can nonproliferative breast disease and proliferative breast disease without atypia be distinguished by fine-needle aspiration cytology?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Cytologic criteria reported to be helpful in the distinction of proliferative breast disease without atypia (PBD) from nonproliferative breast disease (NPBD) have not been rigorously tested. METHODS: Fifty-one air-dried, Diff-Quik-stained fine-needle aspirates (FNA) of palpable breast lesions with biopsy-proven diagnoses of NPBD (34 cases) or PBD (17 cases) were reviewed. The smears were evaluated for the cellularity, size, and architectural arrangement of the epithelial groups; the presence of single epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells; and nuclear characteristics. RESULTS: The only cytologic feature found to be significantly different between PBD and NPBD was a swirling pattern of epithelial cells. A swirling pattern was noted in 13 of 17 PBD cases (76%) and 12 of 34 NPBD cases (35%) (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Because there is significant overlap in cytologic features between NPBD and PBD, the distinction between the two entities is difficult in cytologic sampling.", "Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is considered a valid diagnostic procedure in management of patients with breast lesions. It is also important to differentiate benign nonproliferative change from proliferative breast changes, since the risk of development of breast carcinoma in patients with atypical hyperplasia is 4-5 times that of general population. Therefore, the recognition of proliferative breast disease with atypia significantly impacts on the patient's subsequent management. To assess the feasibility of a cytologic grading system to further characterize benign breast lesions, cytologic preparation of 87 mammographically guided FNABs were studied. Cellular aspirates were evaluated for the cellular arrangement, the degree of cellular pleomorphism and anisonucleosis, presence of myoepithelial cells and nucleoli and the status of the chromatin pattern. Values ranging from 1 to 4 were assigned to each cytologic criterion, and a score based on the sum of the individual values was calculated for each case. The minimum score attainable was thus 6. In our chosen criteria cytologic diagnosis of nonproliferative disease was entertained when the total score ranged from 6 to 10. Proliferative disease without atypia was diagnosed with a total score ranging from 11 to 14. Atypical hyperplasia was reported when the total score ranged from 15 to 18. A cytologic diagnosis of malignancy was entertained when the total score ranged from 19 to 24. The cytologic diagnosis was then compared to the reported histologic diagnosis from the excisional biopsies and the data were statistically analysed. A high degree of concordance was found between the cytologic findings and the histologic diagnosis. This study suggests that it is possible to apply a cytologic grading system to further subclassify benign breast disease and distinguish these forms from neoplastic lesions.", "The cytologic and histologic features of 265 benign breast masses were analyzed in order to examine the ability of fine needle aspiration cytology to accurately subclassify benign breast lesions. Two hundred two of the masses were pure histologic examples of benign breast lesions (72 nonproliferative fibrocystic change, 27 proliferative fibrocystic change, 65 fibroadenoma, 12 abscess, 8 fat necrosis, 7 papilloma, 7 duct ectasia, 2 tubular adenoma, 1 sclerosing adenosis, 1 microglandular adenosis), and 63 masses were mixed lesions. Part I of the study consisted of retrospective comparison of the original cytologic diagnoses with the histologic diagnoses. A nonspecific descriptive diagnosis had been rendered in 135 of 265 (51%) cases, and these descriptive diagnoses corresponded to fibrocystic change in the majority of cases (70%). A specific benign cytologic diagnosis had been made in 130 of 265 (49%) cases, and overall the specific diagnosis was correct in 80% of cases. Part II of the study consisted of the semiquantitative scoring of the cytologic findings of the 202 pure examples of benign breast masses and statistical analysis of differences in the expression of cytologic features between the different types of lesions. Overall cellularity, amount of bipolar stripped nuclei, amount and architectural arrangement of epithelium, epithelial atypia/pleomorphism/nuclear overlapping and amount of apocrine metaplasia, foam cells and stroma were the cytologic parameters that were statistically significant (P < .05) in distinguishing between the cases of fibroadenoma, abscess, papilloma, fat necrosis, duct ectasia and fibrocystic change as a group. No cytologic parameter reached statistical significance in distinguishing between proliferative and nonproliferative fibrocystic change. We conclude that the majority of benign breast lesions yield characteristic cytologic findings that allow their subclassification when sufficiently sampled by fine needle aspiration. The distinction between proliferative and nonproliferative fibrocystic change is less reliable, and cytologic differences observed within this spectrum did not reach statistical significance.", "BACKGROUND: Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) breast is generally considered as a rapid, reliable, and safe diagnostic tool to distinguish non-neoplastic from neoplastic breast lesions. Masood's Scoring Index has been proposed to help in sub-grouping of breast lesions so as to help in surgical management. AIMS: To assess the accuracy of Modified Masood's Scoring Index (MMSI) in the diagnosis of benign and malignant breast lesions in patients with palpable breast lump, and review of literature. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A prospective study from a tertiary care center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study included a total of 100 cases, both females and males, with palpable breast lump, in the age range of 10-80 years, over a period of 2 years from January 2007 to 2009, who underwent FNAC. They were cytologically grouped into five categories as suggested by Masood et al, and confirmed by histopathology. RESULTS: Evaluation of Masood Scoring Index led to modification (Modified Masood Scoring Index; MMSI) by shifting score 9 from Group I to Group II, thus increasing the diagnostic accuracy of the breast lesions. CONCLUSIONS: MMSI was found to be a useful, easily reproducible scoring method of breast lesions to improve diagnostic accuracy of nonproliferative breast disease and proliferative breast disease without atypia cases, as the prognosis and treatment of these cases varies."]}
{"question": "Can we ease the financial burden of colonoscopy?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Polyps identified at colonoscopy are predominantly diminutive (<5 mm) with a small risk (>1%) of high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma; however, the cost of histological assessment is substantial. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether prediction of colonoscopy surveillance intervals based on real-time endoscopic assessment of polyp histology is accurate and cost effective. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted across a tertiary care and private community hospital. Ninety-four patients underwent colonoscopy and polypectomy of diminutive (</=5 mm) polyps from October 2012 to July 2013, yielding a total of 159 polyps. Polyps were examined and classified according to the Sano-Emura classification system. The endoscopic assessment (optical diagnosis) of polyp histology was used to predict appropriate colonoscopy surveillance intervals. The main outcome measure was the accuracy of optical diagnosis of diminutive colonic polyps against the gold standard of histological assessment. RESULTS: Optical diagnosis was correct in 105/108 (97.2%) adenomas. This yielded a sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values (with 95%CI) of 97.2% (92.1-99.4%), 78.4% (64.7-88.7%), 90.5% (83.7-95.2%) and 93% (80.9-98.5%) respectively. Ninety-two (98%) patients were correctly triaged to their repeat surveillance colonoscopy. Based on these findings, a cut and discard approach would have resulted in a saving of $319.77 per patient. CONCLUSION: Endoscopists within a tertiary care setting can accurately predict diminutive polyp histology and confer an appropriate surveillance interval with an associated financial benefit to the healthcare system. However, limitations to its application in the community setting exist, which may improve with further training and high-definition colonoscopes."]}
{"question": "Do some U.S. states have higher/lower injury mortality rates than others?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: This article examines the hypothesis that the six U.S. states with the highest rates of road traffic deaths (group 1 states) also had above-average rates of other forms of injury such as falling, poisoning, drowning, fire, suffocation, homicide, and suicide, and also for the retail trade and construction industries. The converse, second hypothesis, for the six states with the lowest rates of road traffic deaths (group 2 states) is also examined. RESULTS: Data for these 12 states for the period 1983 to 1995 included nine categories of unintentional and four categories of intentional injury. Seventy-four percent of the group 1 states conformed to the first hypothesis, and 85% of the group 2 states conformed to the second hypothesis.

We examined how nutrient intake and adherence to current European nutritional recommendations evolved in a large cohort of European individuals with type 1 diabetes over a period of 7 years. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We analysed data from the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study, a European multicentre prospective cohort study. Standardized 3-day dietary records were employed in individuals with type 1 diabetes. One thousand one hundred and two patients (553 men, 549 women, baseline age 33 +/- 10 years, duration 15 +/- 9 years) had complete nutritional data available at baseline and after 7 years. We calculated mean differences in reported nutrients over time and adjusted these for age, gender, HbA1c and BMI with ANOVA models. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, there were minor changes in nutrients. Reported protein (-0.35% energy (en), fat (-1.07% en), saturated fat (-0.25% en) and cholesterol (-7.42 mg/1000 kcal) intakes were lower, whereas carbohydrate (+1.23% en) and fibre (+0.46 g/1000 kcal) intakes were higher at the 7-year follow-up. European recommendations for adequate nutrient intakes were followed in individuals with type 1 diabetes for protein (76% at baseline and 78% at follow-up), moderately for fat (34, 40%), carbohydrate (34, 41%) and cholesterol (39, 47%), but poorly for fibre (1.4, 2.4%) and saturated fat (11, 13%). CONCLUSION: European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit."]}
{"question": "Adults with mild intellectual disabilities: can their reading comprehension ability be improved?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Adults with a mild intellectual disability (ID) often show poor decoding and reading comprehension skills. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of teaching text comprehension strategies to these adults. Specific research goals were to determine (1) the effects of two instruction conditions, i.e. strategy instruction to individuals and strategy instruction in small groups in a reciprocal teaching context; (2) intervention programme effects on specific strategy tests (so-called direct effects), and possible differences between strategies; (3) (long-term) transfer effects of the programme on general reading comprehension ability; and (4) the regression of general text comprehension by the variables of technical reading, IQ, reading comprehension of sentences (RCS), and pretest and posttest scores on the strategies taught. METHODS: In total, 38 adults (age range 20-72 years; mean age of 36 years) with ID participated in the study. IQs ranged from 45 to 69 with a mean IQ of 58. The intervention programme involved 15 weekly lessons of 1 h each, taught during 3 months. Blocks of lessons included each of Brown and Palincsar's strategies of summarizing, questioning, clarifying and predicting, as participants read and studied narrative and expository texts. RESULTS: Results indicated no significant difference between group and individual instruction conditions. Second, direct programme effects - as determined by posttest-pretest contrasts for strategy tests - were substantial, except for the questioning strategy. Third, even more substantial was the transfer effect to general text comprehension. Moreover, the results on this test were well maintained at a follow-up test. Finally, the variance of general reading comprehension ability was best explained by the test of RCS, and only moderately by the strategies trained. CONCLUSION: The presently used intervention programme provides a good starting point for adults with ID to become better readers."]}
{"question": "Do antibiotics decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity?", "retrieved_passages": ["Introduction Adeno-tonsillectomy is one of the most common procedures performed worldwide in pediatric age group. Antibiotics use after tonsillectomy is like any other surgical procedure; and it is thought that the antibiotic use may help to reduce post-operative morbidity. Giving antibiotics in tonsillectomy patients is a common practice for decades but recently there has been a paradigm shift towards not using the antibiotics, especially in the pediatric population. Methods A prospective study was done on a cohort of 123 patients and they were divided into two groups on the basis of choice to receive or not to receive antibiotics after tonsillectomy, and these patients were followed in post-operative period to see any differences in the rate of complications. Results No significant statistical correlation was found between age, gender or post-operative visits and post-operative complications in between the two groups. Half of the patients received antibiotics; however, the use of antibiotics did not show a significant decrease in post-operative complications. Conclusion Regular use of antibiotics in post-tonsillectomy patients should not be advised as the use of antibiotics do not prevent or reduce post-operative complications in tonsillectomy patients.", "OBJECTIVE: A tonsillectomy audit was carried out and compared with other studies, to emphasize the role of antibiotics. METHODS: This study was carried out at North West Armed Forces Hospital, Tabuk, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during the year January 1999 through to December 1999. This is a retrospective study of patients who had tonsillectomy with or with adenoidectomy, the topics audited included indication for surgery, grade of surgeon, method of surgery, length of hospital stay, complications and the use of postoperative antibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients underwent tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. The patients age ranged between 2 years to 53 years and the majority were children. In our audit we found no difference with regard to grade of surgeons, method of hemostasis in the outcome of surgery. Moreover, postoperative antibiotics had no role in pain control, postoperative fever, secondary hemorrhage or reduction in hospital stay. The administration of analgesics on the basis of, as required, had poor pain control. CONCLUSION: Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Homeopathic Arnica in reducing the morbidity following tonsillectomy. METHODS: Randomised double blind, placebo controlled trial at a tertiary referral centre. 190 patients over the age of 18 undergoing tonsillectomy were randomised into intervention and control groups receiving either Arnica 30c or identical placebo, 2 tablets 6 times in the first post-operative day and then 2 tablets twice a day for the next 7 days. The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores (visual analogue scale) recorded by the patient on a questionnaire over 14 days post-operatively; Secondary outcome measures were: analgesia consumption, visits to the GP or hospital, antibiotic usage, the day on which their swallowing returned to normal and the day on which they returned to work. RESULTS: 111 (58.4%) completed questionnaires were available for analysis. The Arnica group had a significantly larger drop in pain score from day 1 to day 14 (28.3) compared to the placebo group (23.8) with p < 0.05. The two groups did not differ significantly on analgesic consumption or any of the other secondary outcome measures (number of post-operative visits to GP, use of antibiotics and secondary haemorrhage readmissions). CONCLUSION: The results of this trial suggest that Arnica montana given after tonsillectomy provides a small, but statistically significant, decrease in pain scores compared to placebo.", "The objective of this study was to examine factors affecting morbidity after tonsillectomy in children. Data from the National Tonsil Surgery Register in Sweden on 18,712 patients who underwent tonsillectomy with or without simultaneous adenoidectomy between 1 and 18 years of age were analysed. This register includes data on sex, gender, surgical indication, and the surgical and haemostasis techniques used for each patient, as well as patient-reported outcomes for haemorrhage, analgesic use and antibiotic use. Comparison of patients who underwent surgery for infection versus upper airway obstruction revealed a significant increase in haemorrhage complications in the infection group. However, no significant difference remained after the adjustments for confounders in multivariable regression analysis. Instead, the increased risk among patients who underwent surgery for infection was mainly attributable to the use of bipolar diathermy and increased patient age. Patients who received surgery for infection reported more days of analgesic use, as well as more unplanned contacts with a health care service provider due to pain, compared with those who underwent surgery for upper airway obstruction. These results remained significant in multivariate analysis. The use of bipolar diathermy for haemostasis resulted in an increased risk, while the use of cold steel surgical instruments, a younger patient age and female sex led to a decreased risk. The surgical and haemostasis techniques used are the most important factors that affect morbidity after tonsillectomy in the paediatric age group. The choice of surgical techniques is of utmost importance for decreasing morbidity in these patients.", "OBJECTIVES: An assessment of the effects of ginger on pain, nausea, vomiting, bleeding, and wound site healing that occur after tonsillectomy. METHODS: This prospective clinical study was participated by 49 patients aged 18-45 years out of 56 patients that underwent tonsillectomy and regularly attended follow-up visits. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 23 patients that used ginger capsules and group 2 consisted of 26 patients that did not use ginger capsules in addition to the routine antibiotic and paracetamol treatment following tonsillectomy. The pain, nausea, vomiting, and bleeding scores of patients were assessed on days 1, 4, 7, and 10 by using the visual analogue scale. Similarly, the epithelialization degrees of tonsillar bed were assessed on postoperative days 1, 4, 7, and 10 and regular oral intake times of patients were recorded. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups in terms of age and sex. On the postoperative days 1, 4, 7, and 10, the pain scores were lower in the group 1 (all P<0.001) and there were no differences between the two groups in terms of postoperative nausea, vomiting, and bleeding scores (P=0.35 and P=0.53). On the postoperative days 7 and 10, epithelialization in the tonsil bed was quicker in the group 1 (P=0.041 and P=0.026) and the regular oral intake time was earlier in group 1 (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: In this study, ginger relieved pain, accelerated wound site epithelialization, and decreased duration of oral intake following tonsillectomy. It did not result in postoperative bleeding or any other complications. Ginger can be recommended as an adjunct to routine medical treatment for decreasing morbidity following tonsillectomy."]}
{"question": "Body diffusion-weighted MR imaging of uterine endometrial cancer: is it helpful in the detection of cancer in nonenhanced MR imaging?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: In this study, the authors discussed the feasibility and value of diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging in the detection of uterine endometrial cancer in addition to conventional nonenhanced MR images. METHODS AND MATERIALS: DW images of endometrial cancer in 23 patients were examined by using a 1.5-T MR scanner. This study investigated whether or not DW images offer additional incremental value to conventional nonenhanced MR imaging in comparison with histopathological results. Moreover, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured in the regions of interest within the endometrial cancer and compared with those of normal endometrium and myometrium in 31 volunteers, leiomyoma in 14 patients and adenomyosis in 10 patients. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used, with a p<0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In 19 of 23 patients, endometrial cancers were detected only on T2-weighted images. In the remaining 4 patients, of whom two had coexisting leiomyoma, no cancer was detected on T2-weighted images. This corresponds to an 83% detection sensitivity for the carcinomas. When DW images and fused DW images/T2-weighted images were used in addition to the T2-weighted images, cancers were identified in 3 of the remaining 4 patients in addition to the 19 patients (overall detection sensitivity of 96%). The mean ADC value of endometrial cancer (n=22) was (0.97+/-0.19)x10(-3)mm(2)/s, which was significantly lower than those of the normal endometrium, myometrium, leiomyoma and adenomyosis (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: DW imaging can be helpful in the detection of uterine endometrial cancer in nonenhanced MR imaging."]}
{"question": "Do inhaled steroids differ from cromones in terms of hospital admission rates for asthma in children?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of hospital admissions in two child populations receiving different types of drugs as their regular medication for steady-state asthma. METHODS: Annual data on children aged under 16 y treated for asthma, including consumption of regular medication for asthma, numbers of hospital periods, lengths of hospitalizations and annual proportions of readmissions, were collected using patient-specific medical records from 1995 to 1999. In the Kuopio province, on average, 35.6-36.7/1000 children were on maintenance for asthma, of which 23% were receiving cromones, 51% were taking inhaled steroids and 26% were treated with cromones plus intermittent steroids. In the Oulu province, the respective prevalence was 32.7-34.9/1000, and the respective proportions were 5%, 93% and 2%. RESULTS: Total and first admissions, as well as hospital days were clearly less in the Oulu province. In the children aged > or = 6y, the average annual total admissions were 0.3/1000 (Oulu) vs 1.2/1000 (Kuopio) (p < 0.001). Similarly, the first admissions were 0.2/1000 vs 1.0/1000 (p < 0.001), proportions of readmissions 6.3% vs 19.3% (p < 0.05), and numbers of hospital days 0.7/1000 vs 3.8/1000 (p < 0.001). The differences were in the same direction, though less prominent, also among children 2-5 y of age. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that inhaled steroids are better than cromones in preventing admissions for asthma when two provinces with different practices for maintenance medication of steady-state asthma were compared."]}
{"question": "Thrombosis prophylaxis in hospitalised medical patients: does prophylaxis in all patients make sense?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Most studies on thrombosis prophylaxis focus on postoperative venous thrombosis. In medical wards thrombosis prophylaxis is generally restricted to patients who are immobilised. Our primary aim was to investigate the incidence of venous thrombosis in a general internal ward, to assess whether more rigorous prophylaxis would be feasible. METHODS: We investigated the incidence of venous thrombosis in patients hospitalised from 1992 to 1996 and related our findings to literature reports. RESULTS: The incidence of symptomatic venous thrombosis in internal patients during hospitalisation was 39/6332 (0.6%). Among these 39 patients, 24 had a malignancy, whereas 876 out of all 6332 patients had a known malignancy. So, the incidence in this group with cancer was 2.7% compared with 0.3% (15/5456) in the non-cancer group (relative risk for venous thrombosis due to malignancy was 10.0 (95%C.I. 5.3-18.9). CONCLUSION: The incidence of venous thrombosis during hospitalisation in a department of general internal medicine is low and does not justify prophylaxis in all internal patients. Cancer is a strong risk factor for hospital-acquired thrombosis in the medical ward. Further studies may answer the question as to whether thrombosis prophylaxis in this subgroup is feasible.", "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is highly elusive in the sense, that being so common among acutely ill hospitalised patients with multiple risk factors yet remain mostly unrecognised particularly at the early stage. Pulmonary thrombo-embolism (PTE), the most sinister acute complication of DVT carries a high mortality on one hand and involves expensive medicare and investigations on the other hand. Many studies that have been undertaken in recent past on this important clinical issue have produced a wealth of published data to show that in the absence of prophylaxis for DVT in such a setting the mortality rates were significantly high. The need to exphasise importance of DVT prophylaxis has now become a unified word in the management of acutely ill medical patient. This article emphasises the advantages of astute bedside clinical examination in identifying DVT early and the need for prophylaxis to prevent this morose condition.", "Essentials Management of patients with calf deep vein thrombosis remains controversial. We conducted a post-hoc analysis of a placebo controlled LMWH randomized clinical trial. Pain was assessed using visual analogue scale at inclusion, one and six weeks. There was no difference in pain control between the two arms. SUMMARY: Background The optimal management of distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is highly debated. The only available placebo-controlled trial suggested the absence of clear benefit of anticoagulation. Many physicians feel that, beyond preventing thromboembolic complications, anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has the potential to improve pain control. Objectives To analyze whether LMWHs decrease pain in patients with distal deep vein thrombosis. Patients and methods Two-hundred and fifty-two patients included in a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of LMWH in patients with acute distal DVT and who were asked to rate their pain at inclusion and at each medical visit, using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS). Results One hundred and thirty patients were randomized in the therapeutic nadroparin arm and 122 patients were randomized in the placebo arm. Mean VAS values were 4.6 (standard deviation [SD] 2.5) at inclusion, 2.1 (SD 2.0) at 1 week and 0.4 (SD 1.2) at 6 weeks. We calculated the individual variation in VAS between inclusion and 1 week in patients in whom VAS was available at the two study time-points. There was no difference in the mean VAS reduction between patients treated with therapeutic nadroparin (n = 106) and with placebo (n = 109): -2.6 (SD 2.4) vs. -2.3 (SD 2.0) after 1 week and -4.4 (SD 2.8) vs. -4.0 (SD 2.4) after 6 weeks, respectively. The use of compression stockings was associated with a reduction in pain. Conclusion These data suggests that LMWH use does not improve pain control as compared with placebo in patients with acute distal DVT.", "Patients who undergo surgery are at a high risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). To further define the demographics, comorbidities, and risk factors of VTE in patients undergoing major surgery, we analyzed 1,375 hospitalized non-orthopedic surgery patients in a prospective registry of 5,451 patients with ultrasound confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from 183 hospitals in the United States. Extremity edema (67.9%), extremity discomfort (44.9%), and dyspnea (18.9%) were among the most common presenting symptoms among these surgical patients. Compared to medical patients, surgical patients presented with a more occult clinical picture and complained less often of extremity edema (67.9% vs. 73.7%; p = 0.0001), extremity discomfort (44.9% vs. 56.4%; p < 0.0001), or difficulty walking (6.6% vs. 11.2%; p < 0.0001). Immobility within 30 days of DVT diagnosis, prior hospitalization within 30 days of DVT diagnosis, presence of an indwelling central venous catheter, obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2), and previous smoking were the most commonVTE risk factors among surgical patients. Among surgical patients who developed DVT, some form of prophylaxis had been used in only 44%. Once diagnosed with DVT, surgical patients received IVC filters more often than medical patients (20.0% vs. 14.1%; p < 0.0001; adjusted OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.17-1.92; p < 0.001). In conclusion, VTE prophylaxis remains underutilized in surgical patients. The IVC filter utilization rate in surgical patients is significantly higher than in medical patients. Future studies should focus on devising mechanisms to improve implementation of prophylaxis and investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of IVC filters in surgical patients.", "Most physicians understand venous thromboembolism (VTE) to be an acute and time-limited disease. However, pathophysiological and epidemiological data suggest that in most patients VTE recurrence risk is not resolved after the first 6 months of anticoagulation. Recurrence rates are high and potentially life-threatening. In these cases, it would make sense to prolong anticoagulation for an undetermined length of time. However, what about the bleeding rates, induced by prolonged anticoagulation? Would they not outweigh the benefit of reducing the VTE recurrent risk? How long should anticoagulation be continued, and should all patients suffering from VTE be provided with extended anticoagulation? This review will address the most recent data concerning extended anticoagulation in VTE secondary prophylaxis. The reviews of this paper are available via the supplementary material section."]}
{"question": "Do teleoncology models of care enable safe delivery of chemotherapy in rural towns?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: To compare the dose intensity and toxicity profiles for patients undergoing chemotherapy at the Townsville Cancer Centre (TCC), a tertiary cancer centre in northern Queensland, with those for patients treated in Mount Isa, supervised by the same medical oncologists via teleoncology. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design comparing two patient groups. SETTING: TCC and Mount Isa Hospital, which both operate under the auspices of the Townsville Teleoncology Network (TTN). PARTICIPANTS: Eligible patients who received chemotherapy at TCC or Mt Isa Hospital between 1 May 2007 and 30 April 2012. INTERVENTION: Teleoncology model for managing cancer patients in rural towns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dose intensity (doses, number of cycles and lines of treatment) and toxicity rates (rate of serious side effects, hospital admissions and mortality). RESULTS: Over 5 years, 89 patients received a total of 626 cycles of various chemotherapy regimens in Mount Isa. During the same period, 117 patients who received a total of 799 cycles of chemotherapy at TCC were eligible for inclusion in the comparison group. There were no significant differences between the Mount Isa and TCC patients in most demographic characteristics, mean numbers of treatment cycles, dose intensities, proportions of side effects, and hospital admissions. There were no toxicity-related deaths in either group. CONCLUSION: It appears safe to administer chemotherapy in rural towns under the supervision of medical oncologists from larger centres via teleoncology, provided that rural health care resources and governance arrangements are adequate."]}
{"question": "Is There an Additional Value of Using Somatostatin Receptor Subtype 2a Immunohistochemistry Compared to Somatostatin Receptor Scintigraphy Uptake in Predicting Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Response?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is unknown whether tumoral somatostatin receptor subtype 2a (sst2a) immunohistochemistry (IHC) has additional value compared to somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) uptake using OctreoScan(R) in predicting response to peptide receptor radiotherapy using 177Lu-octreotate (PRRT) in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). The aims of this study were: (1) to establish the percentage of sst2a immunopositivity in GEP-NET samples of PRRT-treated patients, (2) to determine the relationship between best GEP-NET response using RECIST 1.0 criteria 1 year after PRRT and tumoral sst2a IHC, and (3) to compare characteristics of patients with sst2a IHC-negative and -positive tumors. METHODS: All 73 consecutive patients were selected for PRRT based on a positive SRS. Radiological response was scored according to RECIST 1.0 criteria. sst2a status was detected on tumor samples by IHC. RESULTS: In total, 93% of GEP-NET samples showed sst2a IHC positivity. No statistically significant relationship was observed between in vitro sst2a expression and in vivo best GEP-NET response 1 year after PRRT (p = 0.47). Sex, primary tumor site, disease stage, ENETS TNM classification, Ki-67 index, highest serum chromogranin-A level, and highest neuron-specific enolase level were not significantly different between patients with negative and positive sst2a tumoral IHC with the exception of age at diagnosis (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: sst2a IHC of tumor samples has no additional value compared to SRS uptake using OctreoScan(R) in predicting tumor response after PRRT."]}
{"question": "Screening for gestational diabetes mellitus: are the criteria proposed by the international association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups cost-effective?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) recently recommended new criteria for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study was undertaken to determine whether adopting the IADPSG criteria would be cost-effective, compared with the current standard of care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a decision analysis model comparing the cost-utility of three strategies to identify GDM: 1) no screening, 2) current screening practice (1-h 50-g glucose challenge test between 24 and 28 weeks followed by 3-h 100-g glucose tolerance test when indicated), or 3) screening practice proposed by the IADPSG. Assumptions included that 1) women diagnosed with GDM received additional prenatal monitoring, mitigating the risks of preeclampsia, shoulder dystocia, and birth injury; and 2) GDM women had opportunity for intensive postdelivery counseling and behavior modification to reduce future diabetes risks. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Our model demonstrates that the IADPSG recommendations are cost-effective only when postdelivery care reduces diabetes incidence. For every 100,000 women screened, 6,178 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are gained, at a cost of $125,633,826. The ICER for the IADPSG strategy compared with the current standard was $20,336 per QALY gained. When postdelivery care was not accomplished, the IADPSG strategy was no longer cost-effective. These results were robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The IADPSG recommendation for glucose screening in pregnancy is cost-effective. The model is most sensitive to the likelihood of preventing future diabetes in patients identified with GDM using postdelivery counseling and intervention.", "OBJECTIVE: To provide healthcare providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data on diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). PARTICIPANTS: A non-U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, nonadvocate 15-member panel representing the fields of obstetrics and gynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, pediatrics, diabetic research, biostatistics, women's health issues, health services research, decision analysis, health management and policy, health economics, epidemiology, and community engagement. In addition, 16 experts from pertinent fields presented data to the panel and conference audience. EVIDENCE: Presentations by experts and a systematic review of the literature prepared by the University of Alberta Evidence-based Practice Centre, through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Scientific evidence was given precedence over anecdotal experience. CONFERENCE PROCESS: The panel drafted its statement based on scientific evidence presented in open forum and on published scientific literature. The draft statement was posted at http://prevention.nih.gov/ for public comment and the panel released a final statement approximately 10 weeks later. The final statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the NIH or the Federal Government. CONCLUSIONS: At present, GDM is commonly diagnosed in the United States using a 1-hour screening test with a 50-gram glucose load followed by a 3-hour 100-gram glucose tolerance test (a two-step approach) for those found to be abnormal on the screen. This approach identifies approximately 5% to 6% of the population as having GDM. In contrast, newly proposed diagnostic strategies rely on the administration of a 2-hour glucose tolerance test (a one-step approach) with a fasting component and a 75-gram glucose load. These strategies differ on whether a 1-hour sample is included, whether two abnormal values are required, and the diagnostic cutoffs that are used. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) has proposed diagnostic thresholds based on demonstrated associations between glycemic levels and an increased risk of obstetric and perinatal morbidities. The panel considered whether a one-step approach to the diagnosis of GDM should be adopted in place of the two-step approach. The one-step approach offers certain operational advantages. The current two-step approach is used only during pregnancy and is largely restricted to the United States. There would be value in a consistent, international diagnostic standard across one's lifespan. This unification would allow better standardization of best practices in patient care and comparability of research outcomes. The one-step approach also holds potential advantages for women and their health care providers, as it would allow a diagnosis to be achieved within the context of one visit as opposed to two. However, the one-step approach, as proposed by the IADPSG, is anticipated to increase the frequency of the diagnosis of GDM by twofold to threefold, to a prevalence of approximately 15% to 20%. There are several concerns regarding the diagnosis of GDM in these additional women. It is not well understood whether the additional women identified by this approach will benefit from treatment, and if so, to what extent. Moreover, the care of these women will generate additional direct and indirect health care costs. There is also evidence that the labeling of these women may have unintended consequences, such as an increase in cesarean delivery and more intensive newborn assessments. In addition, increased patient costs, life disruptions, and psychosocial burdens have been identified. Available studies do not provide clear evidence that a one-step approach is cost-effective in comparison with the current two-step approach. After much deliberation, the panel believes that there are clear benefits to international standardization with regard to the one-step approach. Nevertheless, at present, the panel believes that there is not sufficient evidence to adopt a one-step approach. The panel is particularly concerned about the adoption of new criteria that would increase the prevalence of GDM, and the corresponding costs and interventions, without clear demonstration of improvements in the most clinically important health and patient-centered outcomes. Thus, the panel recommends that the two-step approach be continued. However, given the potential benefits of a one-step approach, resolution of the uncertainties associated with its use would warrant revision of this conclusion.", "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Regarding the various aspects of screening strategies for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to express important conclusions, the recent literature in the field is reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: There are no randomized controlled trials examining the effects of different screening methods on health outcomes. Only few studies investigated the new screening strategies. There is an agreement that universal GDM screening is cost-effective. Several professional societies changed their own guidelines recommending universal GDM screening. Currently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommend routine risk-factor-based screening, whereas the Canadian Diabetes Association, Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and ATLANTIC Diabetes in Pregnancy recommend that all asymptomatic women should be screened at 24-28 weeks' gestation. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening all women with a 75-g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT). The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups recommend no glucose challenge test, but proposed new screening criteria introducing fasting glucose levels less than 5.1 mmol/l. SUMMARY: There is more and more evidence in the recent literature that GDM screening should be universally performed at 24-28 gestational weeks and followed by definitive testing in women who are labeled as high-risk population. Logically, the best strategy would be connecting the screening with diagnosing GDM in the same procedure using a 75-g oGTT, which should be evaluated. General consensus is about measuring plasma glucose to detect pregestational diabetes in high-risk populations by early testing before 20 weeks of gestation."]}
{"question": "Are higher rates of depression in women accounted for by differential symptom reporting?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The gender difference in prevalence and incidence rates of depression is one of the most consistent findings in psychiatric epidemiology. We sought to examine whether any gender differences in symptom profile might account for this difference in rates. METHOD: This study was a population-based 13-year follow-up survey of community-dwelling adults living in East Baltimore in 1981. Subjects were the continuing participants of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program. Participants interviewed between 1993 and 1996 with complete data on depressive symptoms and covariates were included (n = 1727). We applied structural equations with a measurement model for dichotomous data (the MIMIC-multiple indicators, multiple causes-model) to compare symptoms between women and men, in relation to the nine symptom groups comprising the diagnostic criteria for major depression, adjusting for several potentially influential characteristics (namely, age, self-reported ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, and employment). RESULTS: There were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms even taking into account the higher level of depressive symptoms of women and the influence of other covariates. For example, women were no more likely to endorse sadness than were men, as evidenced by a direct effect coefficient that was not significantly different from the null [adjusted estimated direct effect of gender on report of sadness = 0.105, 95% confidence interval (-0.113, 0.323)]. CONCLUSIONS: Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "OBJECTIVE: To determine levels of depression and anxiety symptoms among adults with diabetes and identify factors associated with increased risk. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study administered self-report symptom inventories to patients at the beginning (n = 634) and end (n = 578) of an outpatient diabetes education program. Subjects (n = 246) contacted by mail 6 months later completed the same instruments. RESULTS: Rates of disturbance for depression (41.3%; 95% CI: 37.4-45.2%) and anxiety (49.2%; 95% CI: 45.3-53.1%) were higher than those typical in the general population (10-20%). Probability of disturbance ranged from 5-7% for those with the lowest risk profile to 82-92% for those with the highest risk profile. Diabetes-related complications were the only disease factor associated with significantly increased risk of disturbance. Women and those with less education were at much higher risk. Only 13% of those followed for 6 months were disturbed at all three time-points. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is associated with increased risk of psychological disturbance, especially for those with more diabetes-related complications. Sociodemographic factors account for much of the risk differential among people with diabetes.", "It is surprising to note the evolution of success rates in Belgian universities especially in the first Year. Men are less successful than women and the differences are escalating in an alarming way. Dropouts take the same direction and women now represent a majority of the students at the university. In a previous study, we assessed 616 students in the first Year at the university of Liege with Vasev, the English name of which was TASTE, a self report questionnaire constituted of 4 factors: anxiety, self confidence, procrastination and performance value; anxiety particularly concerned somatic expression of students before and during test evaluations; self confidence was a cognitive component close to self efficacy; procrastination was the behavioral component characterizing avoidance when students are confronted with the risk of failure; performance value referred to intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. French validation of TASTE led to an abbreviated version of 50 items (THEE) consisting of 5 factors, the four of TASTE and an additional one, very consistent, at first called depression because of its correlations with this dimension, then called sense of competence on account of its semantic content. Self-competence has been described in the literature of Achievement Motivation and corresponded to expectancy and ability beliefs in performance process which was also relevant to self-efficacy except the particularity of comparison with others, which was not included in the last construct. Self-competence has been considered as an important part of the Worry component of test anxiety. Some Authors didn't hesitate to view causality flowing from self-competence to test anxiety and have conceptualized the latter as a failure of the self where one's sense of competence has been undermined as a result of experienced failure. In our study, only that factor was equally scored in women and men whereas it was scored higher in failed students. In other respects anxiety and performance value were scored higher in women, self-confidence and procrastination higher in men. Because TASTE didn't discriminate the different components of motivation (performance value referred to intrinsic and extrinsic motivations without precise distinction) we decided to use the MPS (Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale) which gave the opportunity to distinguish SOP (Self Oriented Perfectionism) ie, the self-imposed unrealistic standards with inability to accept faults in order to know and master a subject, that corresponded to intrinsic motivation; SPP (Socially Prescribed Perfectionism) ie, the exaggerated expectancies of others which are subjectively believed as imposed and uncontrollable leading to anxiety, feelings of failure or helplessness, that corresponded to extrinsic motivation; POO (Perfectionism Oriented to Others) ie, the unrealistic demands expected from significant others, which especially characterized males. We assumed that women attached more importance to succeed and submitted more to society exigencies. That way extrinsic and intrinsic motivations were probably more combined unlike men who, dreading a loss of self esteem, tried to avoid failure responsibility in using self handicapping or aggressive behaviours, so separating motivation in an extrinsic part turned to performance value and an intrinsic one more concerned by self confidence and sense of competence with the result that the motivational balance was surely disrupted in case of high competition leading to failure or avoidance. In another previous study we established a structural model illustrating, according to gender, correlations between anxiety, sense of incompetence, self-oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism. Self-oriented perfectionism was less correlated to socially prescribed perfectionism in boys than in girls; furthermore especially by those who had never failed, it was negatively correlated to sense of incompetence, thus leading to lower scores of anxiety while in girls, by contrast, such a correlation didn't exist, thus involving higher anxiety. That way, on the one hand, intrinsic and extrinsic motivations by female students complementarily operated on the sense of incompetence and consequently on anxiety, the emotional component of test anxiety; on the other hand, by male students, intrinsic motivation had a negative correlation with the sense of incompetence and a lower correlation with extrinsic motivation, thereby shedding some light on the problem of anxiety level differences according to gender. More, that observation corresponded well to the model of self-worth where test anxiety was understood as a manifestation of perceived incompetence and as a defensive way to ward off negative self-evaluation; that model suited particularly well to boys and explained their attempts to maintain self-worth when risking academic failure. The present research assumes that independence or combination of motivation components is also correlated to different expressions of aggressiveness: hostility corresponding to threat and characterizing more girls while physical aggression is corresponding to personal challenge, a more masculine attribution. If fighting against the sense of incompetence actually characterizes men and consequently shows too the competitive aspects of performance strong enough to mobilize intrinsic motivation, what would be expected regarding the notion of threat suspected to be predominant in girls? The idea of using a questionnaire discriminating the specific dimensions of aggressiveness in fact the Aggression Questionnaire should meet the following purposes: At first establish a French version of that aggression questionnaire, perform the factorial analyses and internal consistency, compare them with other previous samples, then differentiate gender in general and in failure versus success situations. Finally include the different components of aggressiveness in the first described model and build a new one liable to define in boys the explicit pathways between test anxiety, perfectionism and aggressiveness. Statistical analyses have confirmed, in a 3 factor solution, the presence of emotional (anger), cognitive (hostility) and behavioural (physical aggression) components. Internal consistency is satisfactory. It is demonstrated that physical aggression characterizes boys (F=12.04, p=0.0001) while hostility (F=5.22, p=0.0015) and anger (F=0.49, p=0.0001) characterizes girls; furthermore it is noted that physical aggression characterizes more failed students (F=13.43, p=0.0003). Four models (see figures 2, 3, 4, 5) have been established, at first focused on the distinction of correlations between motivation and cognitive and emotional components on the samples of boys (n=268) and girls (348), then developed on the samples of successful students, male (n=193) and female (n=271). They describe the differentiated action of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations on the different components of aggressiveness and test-anxiety according to gender and without experience of failure. The dynamic process of the organizational factors is different according to gender and psychopathology resulting from the combinations of behaviors, cognitions and emotions would be assumed, prioritizing physical aggression and psychopathy by boys, anxiety and depression by girls. Anyway more explanation about the evolution of success rates of boys and girls in Belgian universities is proposed.", "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present work is to determine whether bulimia nervosa (BN) and eating disorder not otherwise specified, BN type (EDNOS-BN) were qualitatively distinct in terms of eating and general psychopathology. METHOD: This study presents a comparison of 138 women with BN and 57 with EDNOS-BN from a multisite study on eating-related and general psychopathology measures. RESULTS: Although women with BN reported higher lifetime history rates of anorexia nervosa, greater binge eating and vomiting frequency, and more eating concerns, no significant differences were observed between groups on measures of perfectionism, impulsivity, obsessive-compulsiveness, anxiety, depressive symptomatology, or alcohol/substance problems. Based on the partial eta2 values, the distinction between BN and EDNOS-BN accounted for <5% of the criterion variance in general psychopathology measures. Post hoc analyses comparing EDNOS-BN with objective bulimic episodes (OBEs; n=34) versus no OBEs (n=23) found greater EDEQ-4 Restraint subscale scores for EDNOS-BN without OBEs. However, there was no significant difference on the EDEQ-4 Eating Concern subscale between the two EDNOS-BN subgroups. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the clinical significance of BN partial syndrome and prompt reevaluation of existing BN diagnostic boundaries. Post hoc analyses also underscore the need for greater differentiation within EDNOS.", "Perfectionism is a dimension which has been studied very little as a separate entity. It is not even considered as a nosological factor. No classification of the medical sciences underlines its importance other than to speak of a personality trait, of an aspect, or of a parameter. Nevertheless, perfectionism is related to multiple disorders such as depression (18, 20, 36), suicide (8, 16, 55), nutritional problems (11, 28), anxiety (3), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (53), social phobia (2), as well as insomnia (46). Certain authors stress the possible role of perfectionism in the development or the persistence of a substantial number of these disorders (7, 22, 38). Given these facts, it is all the easier to understand the interest shown by clinicians and researchers in the subject. Better detection and evaluation of its impact on behaviour is important in putting therapies in place (6, 53). Relationships between perfectionism and fear of failure have been approached (21, 51, 54). Correlations between perfectionism and high levels of state and trait anxiety have been demonstrated (23). The evaluation of perfectionism has been dealt with very little. Some questionnaires devote a sub-category to it, such as the Eating Disorder Inventory and the Irrational Beliefs Test. However, recently, it has been recognized that perfectionism is a multidimensional construct. Two Multidimensional Perfectionism Scales have been developed and investigated in relative isolation. Frost, Marten, Lahart and Rosenblate defined perfectionism as the setting of excessively high standards for performance associated with critical self-evaluation. Six dimensions are described: concern over making mistakes, high personal standards, parental expectations, parental criticism, doubt about quality of performance and organization. Internal consistency and validity have been established (25, 26). Hewitt and Flett (30, 31, 33, 35) have developed another approach where three dimensions of perfectionism are described: SOP (Self Oriented Perfectionism) related to high standards and self criticism, SPP (Socially Prescribed Perfectionism) related to the need of approval from others and fear of negative evaluation, OOP (Other-Oriented Perfectionism) reflecting a tendency to set high expectations for others and to evaluate them in a demanding way; this component is related, especially for males, to self-esteem, hostility and authoritarianism. Validity and internal consistency have been established too (30, 31, 35). The Frost and al's Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale and the Hewitt and Flett's scales are closely associated, except concerning the OOP. Because this component could provide new information, we have chosen the second scale, referring to the French translation and validation of Labrecque (45). EMP is the French name of MPS; it is a self-report questionnaire of 45 questions, in fact three subscales of 15 items rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale. MPS was administered to 617 first year students at the university of Liege (table II). Differences are considered according to gender and experience of failure i.e. the fact of repeating an academic year. We realized a component analysis with promax rotation. Among the different possibilities offered by the scree-test the choice of a 4 factor solution stresses the original structure: SOP (14 items), SPP (12 items), OOP (9 items) and anti OOP (10 items); the last one is additional but allows for respecting semantics and saturation of the items. The first aim of confirming validity and internal consistency is satisfactory. In other respects the multidimensional structure of the concept leads to consideration of a positive, adaptive perfectionism and a more negative perfectionism, facilitating psychopathology (59, 60, 61). So it seems interesting to compare the different components of MPS in order to find an eventual sex-failure effect. The evaluation of perfectionism is obvious, considering it as a personality trait, but it can be used also in taking into account stress and its impact, for instance that of academic performance (29, 37, 39, 58). Conferring on MPS more pertinence in gender differentiation and failure evaluation is an other goal of this research. Through the particular choice of statistical results, sex and sex-failure effects can be demonstrated: a MANOVA underlines sex effect (lambda de Wilks = 0.96, p = 0.001) and sex-failure effect (lambda de Wilks = 0.98, p = 0.05). Structure of MPS is different in four groups (FE: women with failure, FnE: women without failure, ME: men with failure, MnE: men without failure). ANOVA show differences of MPS3, MPS1 and MPS2. Far more promising is the use of LISREL method allowing for the construction of a coherent model of relationships between some dimensions of MPS and Test-Anxiety, approached here with THEE (test d'habilete aux etudes et a leur evaluation) French abbreviated version (49) of TASTE (Test for Ability to Study and Evaluation). In fact according to the literature of fear of failure, girls score higher on anxiety and procrastination but less on self-confidence. The structural model shows different pathways, more especially between SPP (socially prescribed perfectionism), T2 (sense of incompetence) and T1 (anxiety). SOP (self oriented perfectionism) and SPP (socially prescribed perfectionism) by girls are very much correlated; it seems that they are more subjected to society and its exigencies of studying but consequently they are more at risk of anxiety and a sense of incompetence. SOP (self oriented perfectionism) by boys functions more indiscriminately of SPP (socially prescribed perfectionism) and is negatively correlated with self-incompetence; boys are more self-confident but they usually procrastinate more probably because failure expectancies would be particularly harmful for their self-esteem; consequently, failure should be related to something else than their own capacity; this may be an explanation of the high rate of male dropouts and failure in the first year at the university of Liege; also a factor explaining the female domination at the university. In the same way the first choice of studies is moving towards shorter and less difficult orientation (46). In case of failure the model is very similar according to gender: SOP (self oriented perfectionism) and T1 (anxiety) are directly connected; SOP and SPP are in this case better correlated by boys but the path between SPP, sense of incompetence and anxiety is less significant than in girls. In conclusion, providing some modifications according to semantics, the choice of a four factor solution allows for confirmation of the original structure of MPS and for internal consistency. The different components of MPS vary according to gender: SOP and more OOP discriminate men and women; SPP allows for differentiating women with failure. A structural model enhances the role of perfectionism in the cognitive and behavioural contexts; for instance it clarifies its action on fear of failure and success rates according to gender."]}
{"question": "Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme and frequency of severe hypoglycaemia in Type 1 diabetes: does a relationship exist?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIMS: An association has been described between elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and an increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia (SH). To ascertain whether this reported association could be replicated in a different country, it was re-examined in 300 individuals with Type 1 diabetes. METHODS: People with Type 1 diabetes, none of whom was taking renin-angiotensin system blocking drugs, were recruited. Participants recorded the frequency with which they had experienced SH. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and serum ACE were measured. The difference in the incidence of SH between different quartiles of ACE activity and the relationship between serum ACE and SH were examined using non-parametric statistical tests and a negative binomial model. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 300 patients [158 male; HbA(1c) median (range) 8.2% (5.2-12.8%), median age 36 years (16-88); duration of diabetes 14.5 years (2-49)]. The incidence of SH was 0.93 episodes per patient year. The mean incidence of SH in the top and bottom quartiles of ACE activity was 0.5 and 1.7 episodes per patient year, respectively, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.075). Spearman's test showed a very weak, although statistically significant, association between serum ACE level and SH incidence (r = 0.115, P = 0.047). The binomial model also showed a statistically significant (P = 0.002), but clinically weak, relationship between serum ACE and SH. CONCLUSIONS: The present survey showed a weak relationship between serum ACE and the frequency of SH, the clinical relevance of which is unclear. This limits the proposed role for serum ACE as an index of risk for SH."]}
{"question": "Prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness - does it inevitably progress to Meniere's disease?", "retrieved_passages": ["CONCLUSION: We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether low-tone SD was a precursor of Meniere's disease and whether patients with low-tone SD suffered from endolymphatic hydrops. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case review in the university hospital. A total of 184 patients with low-tone SD were divided into two groups with single and recurrent episodes. The progress, follow-up audiograms, and ECochG results of the patients were reviewed and compared with those of patients with high-tone SD and Meniere's disease. RESULTS: In all, 83 of 177 patients with low-tone SD unaccompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; 15 of the 83 developed vertiginous attacks. The remaining 94 patients had a single episode. Three of the seven patients with low-tone SD accompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; two of the three were subsequently confirmed to have Meniere's disease. The other four had a single episode. No difference in rate of progress from SD to Meniere's disease was observed among the low-tone and the high-tone SD groups. The average -SP/AP of each group with a single episode is smaller than that of other groups with recurrent episodes and Meniere's disease."]}
{"question": "Can pictorial warning labels on cigarette packages address smoking-related health disparities?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the most effective content of pictorial health warning labels (HWLs) and whether educational attainment moderates these effects. METHODS: Field experiments were conducted with 529 adult smokers and 530 young adults (258 nonsmokers; 271 smokers). Participants reported responses to different pictorial HWLs printed on cigarette packages. One experiment involved manipulating textual form (testimonial narrative vs. didactic) and the other involved manipulating image type (diseased organs vs. human suffering). RESULTS: Tests of mean ratings and rankings indicated that pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms had equivalent or significantly higher credibility, relevance, and impact than pictorial HWLs with testimonial forms. Results from mixed-effects models confirmed these results. However, responses differed by participant educational attainment: didactic forms were consistently rated higher than testimonials among participants with higher education, whereas the difference between didactic and testimonial narrative forms was weaker or not statistically significant among participants with lower education. In the second experiment, with textual content held constant, greater credibility, relevance, and impact was found for graphic imagery of diseased organs than imagery of human suffering. CONCLUSIONS: Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases."]}
{"question": "Is fear of anaphylactic shock discouraging surgeons from more widely adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cyst?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Sources of reports about laparoscopic and percutaneous treatment of liver hydatid cysts are limited to just a few countries. To address the reason behind this, we carried out a survey of 30 surgeons in northern Jordan. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to collect data regarding the surgical technique preferred by each surgeon. Further information was collected from those not adopting minimal-access techniques to determine their reasons for not doing so. RESULTS: Only 3 surgeons (10%) considered laparoscopy as the first line of treatment. Of the 27 surgeons who did not consider percutaneous or laparoscopic treatment, fear of anaphylaxis and/or dissemination was the main reason given by 21 surgeons (78%) for not using minimal access techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst."]}
{"question": "Reporting and interpreting red blood cell morphology: is there discordance between clinical pathologists and clinicians?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Clinical pathologists (CPs) report RBC morphologic (RBC-M) changes to assist clinicians in prioritizing differential diagnoses. However, reporting is subjective, semiquantitative, and potentially biased. Reporting decisions vary among CPs, and reports may not be interpreted by clinicians as intended. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to survey clinicians and CPs about RBC-M terms and their clinical value, and identify areas of agreement and discordance. METHODS: Online surveys were distributed to small animal clinicians via the Veterinary Information Network and to CPs via the ASVCP listserv. A quiz assessed understanding of RBC-M terms among respondent groups. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze responses to survey questions, and quiz scores were compared among groups. RESULTS: Analyzable responses were obtained from 1662 clinicians and 82 CPs. Both clinicians and CPs considered some terms, e.g., agglutination, useful, whereas only CPs considered other terms, e.g., ghost cells, useful. All groups interpreted certain terms, e.g., Heinz bodies, correctly, whereas some clinicians misinterpreted others, e.g., eccentrocytes. Responses revealed that CPs often do not report RBC-M they consider insignificant, when present in low numbers. Twenty-eight percent of clinicians think CPs review all blood smears while only 19% of CPs report reviewing all smears. CONCLUSIONS: Important differences about the clinical relevance of certain RBC-M terms exist between clinicians and CPs. Inclusion of interpretive comments on CBC reports is the clearest way to ensure that RBC-M changes are interpreted as intended by the CP. Reporting practices should be examined critically to improve communication, transparency, and ultimately medical decisions."]}
{"question": "Measuring hospital mortality rates: are 30-day data enough?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: We compare 30-day and 180-day postadmission hospital mortality rates for all Medicare patients and those in three categories of cardiac care: coronary artery bypass graft surgery, acute myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. DATA SOURCES/COLLECTION: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) hospital mortality data for FY 1989. STUDY DESIGN: Using hospital level public use files of actual and predicted mortality at 30 and 180 days, we constructed residual mortality measures for each hospital. We ranked hospitals and used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to compare 0-30, 31-180, and 0-180-day postadmission mortality. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For the admissions we studied, we found a broad range of hospital performance when we ranked hospitals using the 30-day data; some hospitals had much lower than predicted 30-day mortality rates, while others had much higher than predicted mortality rates. Data from the time period 31-180 days postadmission yield results that corroborate the 0-30 day postadmission data. Moreover, we found evidence that hospital performance on one condition is related to performance on the other conditions, but that the correlation is much weaker in the 31-180-day interval than in the 0-30-day period. Using ROC curves, we found that the 30-day data discriminated the top and bottom fifths of the 180-day data extremely well, especially for AMI outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Using data on cumulative hospital mortality from 180 days postadmission does not yield a different perspective from using data from 30 days postadmission for the conditions we studied.", "BACKGROUND: In-hospital mortality measures, which are widely used to assess hospital quality, are not based on a standardized follow-up period and may systematically favor hospitals with shorter lengths of stay (LOSs). OBJECTIVE: To assess the agreement between performance measures of U.S. hospitals by using risk-standardized in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Nonfederal acute care hospitals in the United States with at least 30 admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), and pneumonia from 2004 to 2006. PATIENTS: Medicare fee-for-service patients admitted for AMI, HF, or pneumonia from 2004 to 2006. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day risk-standardized mortality rates (RSMRs). RESULTS: Included patients comprised 718,508 admissions to 3135 hospitals for AMI, 1,315,845 admissions to 4209 hospitals for HF, and 1,415,237 admissions to 4498 hospitals for pneumonia. The hospital-level mean patient LOS varied across hospitals for each condition, ranging from 2.3 to 13.7 days for AMI, 3.5 to 11.9 days for HF, and 3.8 to 14.8 days for pneumonia. The mean RSMR differences (30-day RSMR minus in-hospital RSMR) were 5.3% (SD, 1.3) for AMI, 6.0% (SD, 1.3) for HF, and 5.7% (SD, 1.4) for pneumonia; distributions varied widely across hospitals. Performance classifications differed between the in-hospital and 30-day models for 257 hospitals (8.2%) for AMI, 456 (10.8%) for HF, and 662 (14.7%) for pneumonia. Hospital mean LOS was positively correlated with in-hospital RSMRs for all 3 conditions. LIMITATION: Medicare claims data were used for risk adjustment. CONCLUSION: In-hospital mortality measures provide a different assessment of hospital performance than 30-day mortality and are biased in favor of hospitals with shorter LOSs.

SETTING: A total of 1,868 U.S. hospitals reporting process and outcome measures for AMI and HF to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from July 2005 to June 2006 (Year 0) and July 2006 to June 2007 (Year 1). DESIGN: Observational cohort study measuring the percentage variation in Year 1 hospital 30-day risk-adjusted mortality rate explained by denominator-based weighted composite scores summarizing hospital Year 0 performance. DATA COLLECTION: Data were prospectively collected from hospitalcompare.gov. RESULTS: Percentage variation in Year 1 mortality was best explained by mortality rate alone in Year 0 over other composites including process performance. If only Year 0 mortality rates were reported, and consumers using hospitals in the highest decile of mortality instead chose hospitals in the lowest decile of mortality rate, the number of deaths at 30 days that potentially could have been avoided was 1.31 per 100 patients for AMI and 2.12 for HF (p < .001). CONCLUSION: Public reports focused on 30-day risk-adjusted mortality rate may more directly address policymakers' goals of facilitating consumer identification of hospitals with better outcomes.", "OBJECTIVE: To assess if an incongruous increase in mortality occurs after postoperative day 30. BACKGROUND: In the current climate of public reporting and pay-for-performance, 30-day mortality after inpatient surgery has become a key metric to assess performance. Whereas the intent is to improve quality, there has been increasing concern that reporting 30-day mortality may influence providers' timing of treatment withdrawal. METHODS: We used national Medicare data to identify beneficiaries who underwent 1 of 19 major surgical procedures. We performed a survival analysis and calculated an adjusted daily hazard rate using all-cause mortality, accounting for patient comorbidities and case-mix. We ran linear regression models to examine discontinuity points around the 30-day mark, and conducted subgroup analyses for hospitals participating in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, which focuses on 30-day mortality reporting. RESULTS: We identified 872,968 patients who underwent 1 of 19 surgical procedures of interest; 71,583 of these patients (8.2%) died within 60 days of their index operation. We did not observe any statistically significant increases in mortality in the immediate period after day 30 compared with the immediate period before day 30. In fact, in each model, mortality rates tended to fall in the days after day 30, consistent with a general decreasing risk of death over time. These findings were similar among National Surgical Quality Improvement Program hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of an increase in postoperative mortality after day 30. As payers move towards incorporating 30-day surgical mortality into pay-for-performance programs, these findings serve as a benchmark for measuring potential future unintended consequences of the metric.", "OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a correlation exists in hospitals among 30-day mortality rates for different types of hospitalizations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of hospital care based on publically available Italian data from the National Outcome Evaluation Program Edition 2015 of the Italian Agency for Regional Health Services. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, femoral neck fracture, ischemic stroke and non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or those who underwent isolated cardiac valve procedure, isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery, non-ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and interventions for the following tumors: colon, kidney, brain, lung, stomach, rectal, liver or pancreatic cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Condition-specific 30-day crude and risk-adjusted mortality rates. RESULTS: A total of 808 280 admissions were reported from 844 institutions (median of 4 conditions evaluated per hospital; interquartile range 2-8). Volumes and outcome varied by clinical and surgical conditions across hospitals. Out of 153 pairs of different conditions, 41 were statistically significant in terms of concordance with crude mortality rates and 44 for their adjusted values. The hospital mean percentile rank for 30-day mortality, a composite measure that summarized the multiple indicators, increased significantly alongside number of conditions per hospital with a significant reduction of mortality when most of the studied conditions were treated in the same hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The variability in 30-day mortality rates at hospital level and the correlation between risk mortality rates suggest that there may be common hospital-wide factors influencing short-term mortality."]}
{"question": "Is portable ultrasonography accurate in the evaluation of Schanz pin placement during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of ultrasonography to confirm Schanz pin placement in a cadaveric model, and the interobserver repeatability of the ultrasound methodology. DESIGN: This investigation is a repeated measures cadaveric study with multiple examiners. PARTICIPANTS: Cadaveric preparation and observations were done by an orthopaedic traumatologist and resident, and two general surgery traumatologists. INTERVENTIONS: A total of 16 Schanz pins were equally placed in bilateral femora and tibiae. Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross dissection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection. RESULTS: Schanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography (p < 0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude of pin protrusion increases. Ultrasound data demonstrate good linear correlation and closely represent actual protrusion values in the 5 to 12 mm range. Interobserver repeatability analysis demonstrated that all examiners were not statistically different in their measurements despite minimal familiarity with the ultrasound methodology (p > 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the statistical imparity of pin protrusion measurement via ultrasound compared to that of gross dissection, a consideration of the clinical relevance of ultrasound measurement bias during an austere operating theatre leads to the conclusion that ultrasonography is an adequate methodology for Schanz pin protrusion measurement."]}
{"question": "Sternal skin conductance: a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the accuracy of a new sternal skin conductance (SSC) device in measuring hot flashes and to assess the acceptability of the device by women. METHODS: Three small descriptive pilot studies were performed using two sequential prototypes of the SSC device developed by an engineering device company in the Midwest. The devices were worn either in a monitored setting for 24 hours or in an ambulatory setting for 5 weeks. During the study period, women recorded hot flashes in a prospective hot flash diary and answered questions about the acceptability of wearing the SSC device. RESULTS: The first prototype was not able to collect any analyzable skin conductance data owing to various malfunction issues, including poor conductance and battery failure. However, 16 women wore the device for 5 weeks and reported that wearing the device was acceptable, although 31% stated that it interfered with daily activities. Hot flash data from the second prototype revealed a 24% concordance rate between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes."]}
{"question": "Does partial expander deflation exacerbate the adverse effects of radiotherapy in two-stage breast reconstruction?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The optimum protocol for expander volume adjustment with respect to the timing and application of radiotherapy remains controversial. METHODS: Eighteen New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups. Metallic port integrated anatomic breast expanders of 250 cc were implanted on the back of each animal and controlled expansion was performed. Group I underwent radiotherapy with full expanders while in Group II, expanders were partially deflated immediately prior to radiotherapy. Control group did not receive radiotherapy.The changes in blood flow at different volume adjustments were investigated in Group II by laser Doppler flowmetry. Variations in the histopathologic properties of the irradiated tissues including the skin, capsule and the pocket floor, were compared in the biopsy specimens taken from different locations in each group. RESULTS: A significant increase in skin blood flow was detected in Group II with partial expander deflation. Overall, histopathologic exam revealed aggravated findings of chronic radiodermatitis (epidermal atrophy, dermal inflammation and fibrosis, neovascularisation and vascular changes as well as increased capsule thickness) especially around the lower expander pole, in Group II. CONCLUSIONS: Expander deflation immediately prior to radiotherapy, may augment the adverse effects, especially in the lower expander pole, possibly via enhanced radiosensitization due to a relative increase in the blood flow and tissue oxygenation."]}
{"question": "Should temperature be monitorized during kidney allograft preservation?", "retrieved_passages": ["GOAL: It is generally considered that kidney grafts should be preserved at 4 degrees C during cold storage. However, actual temperature conditions are not known. We decided to study the temperature levels during preservation with the Biotainer storage can and Vitalpack transport pack. MATERIAL: Temperature was monitored using the Thermobouton probe during preservation of pig kidneys, in the same conditions used with human grafts. The probe recorded the temperature level every 10 minutes during four days. We compared the results found with the new storage can with results obtained in the same conditions with the storage can formerly used by our team. We also studied the best position of the probe for temperature monitoring and the influence of the amount of ice within the transport pack on the temperature level. We then monitored the temperature during the conservation of actual human kidney grafts harvested at our institution from August 2007 to May 2008. RESULTS: The temperature levels were the same regardless of the position of the probe within the transport pack. The lowest temperature was maintained during 15 hours, and the temperature level stayed below 5 degrees C for 57 hours with the new storage can. The former storage can maintained the lowest temperature level for 80 minutes, and temperature reached 5 degrees C after 10 hours 40 minutes. Temperature levels were similar when 2 or 4 kg of crushed ice were used. We observed similar results when monitoring the conservation of human grafts. CONCLUSION: The new storage can affords more stable temperature levels when compared to the formerly used can. Since temperature is stable during conservation, continuous monitoring in everyday practice does not seem warranted.", "Static cold storage (SCS) and hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) are currently standard methods for renal grafts clinical preservation. Both methods are predominantly implemented without the active delivery of oxygen, even for donation after circulatory death-like kidneys. However, even under severe hypothermia (4 degrees C-6 degrees C), kidneys can consume oxygen and produce ATP. What is not established, though, is to what extent and how SCS and HMP compare in terms of oxygen. Using a porcine preclinical model of renal warm ischemia (WI) to compare SCS and HMP methods, we continuously monitored and quantified oxygen level and consumption along preservation; we also determined prepreservation and postpreservation cortical ATP level; values were given as median and [min; max] range. One-hour WI reduced ATP by  approximately 90% (from 3.3 [1.7; 4.5] mmol/L tissue in Controls). Oxygen consumption (QO(2), mumol/min per 100 g) was determined from initial solution PO(2) decrease (SCS and HMP) and from arterio-venous difference (HMP). In SCS and HMP, PO(2) decreased rapidly (t(1/2)  approximately 1 h) from atmospheric levels to 52.9 [38.0; 65.9] and 8.2 [3.0, 16.0] mmHg, respectively. In HMP, QO(2) was 2.7 [0.4; 3.9] versus 0.5 [0.0; 1.3] in SCS (P < 0.05); postpreservation ATP amounted to 5.8 [3.2; 6.5] in HMP versus 0.1 [0.0; 0.2] in SCS. Despite hypothermic conditions in SCS or HMP, donation after circulatory death-like renal grafts require oxygen. Increased oxygen consumption, restored ATP level, and improved histological profile in HMP might explain the established HMP superiority over SCS. These results establish a rational basis for the use of oxygen in hypothermic preservation. Optimal levels required for preservation and graft-type variants remain to be determined.", "BACKGROUND: Historically, ex vivo physiological evaluation of cadaveric renal allografts has been limited to assessing perfusate flow (PF) during hypothermic perfusion preservation (HPP). Using a small animal model, we have previously described a method for continuous monitoring of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during HPP. Our study was undertaken to determine if monitoring GFR and PF during HPP distinguished kidneys subjected to preretrieval warm ischemic (WI) injury more reliably than PF alone. METHODS: In situ WI was induced in Lewis rats (n=10) by extrinsic occlusion of the suprarenal aorta for 30 min. After in situ cold perfusion and retrieval, the left kidney underwent 16 hr of HPP. Nonischemic (NI) control kidneys (n=10) were retrieved in the absence of suprarenal aortic occlusion. Longitudinal changes in PF, GFR, and filtration fraction (FF) during HPP were compared in WI versus NI kidneys (FF=GFR/PF x 100%). RESULTS: PF remained the same in both cohorts throughout HPP. GFR, however, increased to a significantly greater degree in WI versus NI kidneys during the first 4 hr of HPP (713+/-401 vs. 26+/-23%, respectively) (P<0.05). The increase in FF at 4 hr was 1203+/-696% in the WI kidneys versus 83+/-46% in the NI controls (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to PF alone, measurement of both PF and GFR distinguished kidneys subjected to pre-WI from NI controls. The data provide a means to determine if monitoring of both GFR and PF during HPP will predict short- and long-term renal allograft function more reliably than PF alone.", "BACKGROUND: Viability assessment during preservation is imperative to avoid unnecessary discard of marginal organs maximizing graft outcomes in kidney transplantation. To address this need, we have developed a novel system based on a rapid sampling microdialysis (rsMD) analyzer allowing continuous tissue monitoring and measurement of metabolic markers of cell damage. Our aim was to develop a tool that allows for accurate assessment of tissue metabolism and organ viability in the preservation period. METHODS: Twenty-two porcine kidneys subjected to 15 min of warm ischemia underwent either 24 h of static cold storage (SCS) or 10 h of hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP). After preservation, tissue temperature was allowed to passively increase to ambient temperature as an ischemic challenge. Cortical and medullary metabolism was monitored throughout with online measurements of lactate concentrations made every 60 s. RESULTS: On commencement of monitoring, lactate concentrations were successfully detected within 15 mins. During the initial 1.5 h, lactate concentrations were similar during SCS (65 muM) and HMP (124 muM, P > 0.05) but lower after 10 h of SCS (SCS: 68 muM versus HMP: 230 muM, P < 0.001). Warming data suggest a resilience of HMP kidneys to subsequent temperature induced ischemia compared to SCS kidneys. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study provides the baseline ischemic profile for porcine kidneys while validating the technique of rsMD as a tool for organ viability assessment during preservation. The data characterize metabolic differences between SCS and HMP preserved allografts and can help elucidate why HMP is clinically superior to SCS allowing development of interventions to augment these benefits.", "Simple cold storage remains the current method of preservation of human heart allografts between removal and transplantation, but this technique is not adequate for prolonged periods of preservation. An alternative to cold storage is machine perfusion of the isolated organ. Although this technique has yielded promising results in kidney preservation, there is limited experience with the heart. One factor limiting the effectiveness of perfusion preservation is the toxicity of oxygen free radicals generated during the perfusion. The generation and reduction of these radicals results in an electron transfer, producing an electrochemical potential known as the redox potential. This study examines the role of machine perfusion in heart preservation with and without the use of a new electrochemical cell that is able to control the redox potential during the perfusion. Hearts were preserved for twenty-four hours by either simple cold storage (Group I), or by machine perfusion with redox monitoring (Group II), or redox control (Group III). Control of the oxidation-reduction potential of the perfusate during machine perfusion of isolated hearts resulted in significantly improved systolic and diastolic function after perfusion compared to hearts that underwent machine perfusion without redox control or simple cold storage."]}
{"question": "Is irritable bowel syndrome a diagnosis of exclusion?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: Guidelines emphasize that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not a diagnosis of exclusion and encourage clinicians to make a positive diagnosis using the Rome criteria alone. Yet many clinicians are concerned about overlooking alternative diagnoses. We measured beliefs about whether IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and measured testing proclivity between IBS experts and community providers. METHODS: We developed a survey to measure decision-making in two standardized patients with Rome III-positive IBS, including IBS with diarrhea (D-IBS) and IBS with constipation (C-IBS). The survey elicited provider knowledge and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion. We surveyed nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, community gastroenterologists, and IBS experts. RESULTS: Experts were less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8 vs. 72%; P<0.0001). In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01). Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and consumed $364 more than others (P<0.0001). Experts only rated celiac sprue screening and complete blood count as appropriate in D-IBS; nonexperts rated most tests as appropriate. Parallel results were found in the C-IBS vignette. CONCLUSIONS: Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains a diagnosis of exclusion, whereby an extensive investigation is performed to exclude other organic diseases that may explain the symptoms of patients. Attempts to have a positive diagnosis based on symptom assessments failed to achieve widely use in clinical practice. Abnormalities in the gastrointestinal endocrine cells in IBS patients have been reported recently, providing evidence that IBS is an organic disorder, and opening the door to the use of these abnormalities as markers for a positive diagnosis of IBS. New and promising drugs for the treatment of IBS with constipation as the predominant symptom are currently on the market, and the treatment results have been satisfactory thus far.", "Rather than being a diagnosis of exclusion, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a diagnosis that can be identified by symptom-based criteria. The collection of these criteria by a meticulous history can be enhanced by using various tools. Once a positive diagnosis is made, using clinical criteria for diagnosis, one should look for alarm or warning symptoms or signs, and should characterize the type of bowel habit. Determining whether the condition is a diarrhea-predominant or a constipation-predominant IBS will direct further diagnostic evaluation and management.", "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is among the most common diagnoses made by medical providers and its symptoms are common causes for health care consultation. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain associated with abnormal stool consistency and/or frequency and is widely considered a diagnosis of exclusion, despite abundant evidence contradicting such an approach. A positive diagnosis is achieved through application of symptom-based clinical criteria, careful history and physical examination, evaluation for alarm sign/symptoms, and judicious use of diagnostic testing. This article reviews the symptom-based criteria for IBS and utility of diagnostic tests commonly included in the evaluation of IBS symptoms.", "The symptom-based diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has not been established in everyday clinical practice, and the diagnosis of this disorder remains one of exclusion. It has been demonstrated that the densities of duodenal chromogranin A, rectal peptide YY and somatostatin cells are good biomarkers for the diagnosis of sporadic IBS, and low-grade mucosal inflammation is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of postinfectious IBS. Genetic markers are not useful as biomarkers for IBS since the potential risk genes have yet to be validated, and the intestinal microbiota cannot be used because of the lack of an association between a specific bacterial species and IBS. Furthermore, gastrointestinal dysmotility and visceral hypersensitivity tests produce results that are too nonconsistent and noncharacteristic to be used in the diagnosis of IBS. A combination of symptom-based assessment, exclusion of overlapping gastrointestinal diseases and positive biomarkers appears to be the best way to diagnose IBS."]}
{"question": "Is pelvic pain associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To investigate the significance of pelvic pain and its association with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross sectional study of 248 women with stage II POP or greater. Women were stratified into \"pain\" and \"no-pain\" groups based on their response to a question on the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory short form. Associations between patient demographics, exam findings and responses to validated questionnaires were evaluated. RESULTS: In women with POP, defecatory symptoms are significantly more common in women with pelvic pain including straining with bowel movement (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3, 4.6), sense of incomplete emptying (OR 4.4, 95% CI 2.3, 8.2), pain with bowel movement (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.2, 23.0) and splinting with bowel movement (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.0, 7.5). CONCLUSION: In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "Pelvic floor disorders including pelvic organ prolapse (POP), urinary dysfunction, defecatory dysfunction, and complications after pelvic floor surgery are relatively common in the female population. Imaging tests are obtained when the initial clinical evaluation is thought to be incomplete or inconclusive or demonstrates findings that are discordant with patients' symptoms. An integrated imaging approach is optimal to evaluate the complex anatomy and dynamic functionality of the pelvic floor. Fluoroscopic cystocolpoproctography (CCP) and MR defecography are considered the initial imaging tests of choice for evaluation of POP. Fluoroscopic voiding cystourethrography is considered the initial imaging test for patients with urinary dysfunction. Fluoroscopic CCP and MR defecography are considered the initial imaging test for patients with defecatory dysfunction, whereas ultrasound pelvis transrectal is a complementary test in patients requiring evaluation for anal sphincter defects. MRI pelvis without and with intravenous contrast, MRI pelvis with dynamic maneuvers, and MR defecography are considered the initial imaging tests in patients with suspected complications of prior pelvic floor surgical repair. Transperineal ultrasound is emerging as an important imaging tool, in particular for screening of pelvic floor dysfunction and for evaluation of midurethral slings, vaginal mesh, and complications related to prior pelvic floor surgical repair. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.", "AIM: Myofascial pelvic pain is a chronic and debilitating condition, sometimes associated with pelvic floor disorders (PFD) such as urinary incontinence, defecatory dysfunction or pelvic organ prolapse. Our aim was to identify risk factors in women with PFD and hypertonic pelvic floor, compared to controls without hypertonicity. METHODS: Case control study (2009-2017) of patients with PFD and a diagnosis of hypertonic pelvic floor. Cases were matched with patients who presented with the same PFD but without pelvic floor hypertonicity. Postoperative patients with hypertonic pelvic floor were matched with patients who underwent surgery for the same PFD but did not develop pain. Risk factors were compared between groups. RESULTS: Ninety-five cases were matched; 71% had urogynecologic surgery as a possible trigger for myofascial pain. Most were post-menopausal. Overall, case patients were younger than controls (mean 54 vs 59, P = 0.002). Multivariate logistic regression identified risk factors of younger age (OR 1.45, 95%CI 1.04-2.07), history of depression (OR 3, 95%CI 1.03-9.09), musculoskeletal spine injury (OR 4.32, 95%CI 1.01-21.26) and transobturator midurethral sling (OR 8.36, 95%CI 2.68-31.32). Retropubic midurethral sling was protective against pelvic floor hypertonicity (OR 0.37, 95%CI 0.15-0.86). A clinical prediction model including depression, endometriosis, irritable bowel, spine injury and type of midurethral sling was developed to estimate the probability for myofascial pain after urogynecologic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Specific risk factors predispose women with PFD to chronic pelvic floor hypertonicity. Knowledge of these can help with patient counselling and choice of midurethral sling prior to PFD surgery.", "AIMS: Our aim was to assess the usability of the IUGA/ICS classification system for mesh erosion in a tertiary clinical practice and to determine if assigned classification is associated with patient symptoms, treatment, and outcome. METHODS: We retrospectively identified women who had mesh erosion after prolapse or incontinence surgery. Each erosion was classified using the IUGA/ICS category time site (CTS) system. Associations between classification and presenting symptom (asymptomatic, pain, bleeding, voiding, or defecatory dysfunction, infection, prolapse), treatment type, and outcome were evaluated with chi-squared test, student's t-test, and univariate logistic regression. RESULTS: We identified 74 subjects with mesh erosion; only 70% were classifiable. Asymptomatic patients (n = 19) (Category A) were more likely to be managed conservatively (P = 0.001). Symptomatic patients (n = 55) (Category B) were more likely to be managed surgically (P = 0.003). Other variables had no association with treatment. No variables were associated with outcome. Presenting symptom was associated with both treatment (P = 0.005) and outcome (P = 0.03). Asymptomatic subjects were more likely to have satisfactory outcome (P = 0.03). Urinary frequency and urgency were highly correlated with surgical management (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: One third of mesh erosions could not be retrospectively coded using the IUGA/ICS classification. The components of the system were not predictive of treatment nor outcome with exception of the Category A (asymptomatic) and Category B (symptomatic). Asymptomatic women with mesh erosion can be successfully managed with conservative measures. Use of a classification system may be enhanced if the system is simplified by limiting the number of variables to those associated with interventions and patient outcome. Neurourol.

(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: We report the prevalence of levator myalgia (LM) and describe symptom bother and comorbidities associated with this examination finding. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of patients referred to urogynecology practices: a private practice (COMM) and a tertiary university-based practice (UNIV). We identified within our population a subset of patients with LM and a reference group without LM. The primary outcome was to report the prevalence of LM within a urogynecology referral population. Our secondary outcomes include mean Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ) scores, medication use, medical co-morbidities, and presence of vulvodynia. RESULTS: The prevalence of LM was 24% at the UNIV detected on 5,618 examinations and 9% at the COMM based on 946 examinations. Women with LM were significantly younger: mean age 56.8 years vs 65.5 (p < 0.001). There was no difference in mean parity (2.3), BMI (28.2 kg/m(2)), and race (94% white). Patients with LM reported significantly higher mean symptom bother scores (PFDI, PFIQ; p = <0. 001) related to prolapse, defecatory dysfunction, and urinary symptoms. Women with LM were more likely to report a diagnosis of fibromyalgia (OR 4.4 [1.7, 11.0]), depression (OR 1.8 [1.2, 2.7]), a history of sexual abuse (OR 2.4 [1.3, 4.7]), and use narcotic pain medications (OR 2.5 [1.2, 5.2]).

{"question": "Does ibuprofen increase perioperative blood loss during hip arthroplasty?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prior exposure of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increases perioperative blood loss associated with major orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: Fifty patients scheduled for total hip replacement were allocated to two groups (double blind, randomized manner). All patients were pretreated for 2 weeks before surgery: Group 1 with placebo drug, Group 2 with ibuprofen. All patients were injected intrathecally with bupivacaine 20mg plus morphine 0.1 mg, in a total volume of 4 mL, to provide surgical anaesthesia. RESULTS: The presence of severe adverse effects caused eight patients in the ibuprofen group and six in the placebo group to terminate their participation in the trial. The perioperative blood loss increased by 45% in the ibuprofen group compared with placebo. The total (+/-SD) blood loss in the ibuprofen group was 1161 (+/-472) mL versus 796 (+/-337) mL in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with ibuprofen before elective total hip surgery increases the perioperative blood loss significantly. Early discontinuation of non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is advised."]}
{"question": "Is fluoroscopy essential for retrieval of lower ureteric stones?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of ureteroscopy for lower ureteric stones without the use of fluoroscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 2001 and January 2005, a total of 110 patients with a mean age of 33.5 years (range 12-65) suffering from of lower ureteral calculi (below the upper margin of the sacroiliac joint) prospectively underwent ureteroscopic removal. Retrograde pyelography was avoided, and no safety guidewire was placed. Whenever required, the ureteric meatus was dilated with a ureteric balloon under direct vision. Double-J stent placement was done with the aid of ureteroscopy. A fluoroscope was kept standby. The patients had a postoperative X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region to document the stone clearance. RESULTS: The mean stone size was 8.7 mm (range 6-15). Complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 99 patients (94.2%). Fluoroscopy was required in 6 patients (4%) for calcified stricture (n = 1), duplex system (n = 1), narrow and tortuous meatus causing difficulty in passing the 5-Fr balloon dilator (n = 3), and confirmation of spontaneous passage of the stone (n = 1). Of the 13 patients who required balloon dilatation it was successfully achieved without fluoroscopy. Double-J stenting was done due to mucosal ulceration (n = 3), polypoid reaction (n = 2), and perforation (n = 1). All these patients had correct placement of the stent, as confirmed by X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients."]}
{"question": "Does the sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery influence distal embolisation?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Embolisation of atherosclerotic debris during abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is responsible for significant peri-operative morbidity. Reports have suggested that preferential clamping of the distal vessel(s) before the proximal aorta may decrease the number of emboli passing distally and hence reduce complications. METHODS: Forty patients undergoing AAA repair were randomised to have either first clamping of the proximal aorta or the iliac vessels. Emboli passing through the Superficial Femoral Arteries were detected with a Transcranial Doppler ultrasound system. RESULTS: There was no difference between the two groups in the number of emboli detected (p=0.49) and no significant correlation between number of emboli and dissection time (r=0.0008). However, there was a significantly higher number of emboli in the patient sub-group that were current smokers (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs."]}
{"question": "Are lower fasting plasma glucose levels at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes associated with improved outcomes?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes may be present for several years before diagnosis, by which time many patients have already developed diabetic complications. Earlier detection and treatment may reduce this burden, but evidence to support this approach is lacking. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Glycemic control and clinical and surrogate outcomes were compared for 5,088 of 5,102 U.K. Diabetes Prospective Study participants according to whether they had low (<140 mg/dl [<7.8 mmol/l]), intermediate (140 to <180 mg/dl [7.8 to <10.0 mmol/l]), or high (> or =180 mg/dl [> or =10 mmol/l]) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels at diagnosis. Individuals who presented with and without diabetic symptoms were also compared. RESULTS: Fewer people with FPG in the lowest category had retinopathy, abnormal biothesiometer measurements, or reported erectile dysfunction. The rate of increase in FPG and HbA(1c) during the study was identical in all three groups, although absolute differences persisted. Individuals in the low FPG group had a significantly reduced risk for each predefined clinical outcome except stroke, whereas those in the intermediate group had significantly reduced risk for each outcome except stroke and myocardial infarction. The low and intermediate FPG groups had a significantly reduced risk for progression of retinopathy, reduction in vibration sensory threshold, or development of microalbuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: People presenting with type 2 diabetes with lower initial glycemia who may be earlier in the course of their disease had fewer adverse clinical outcomes despite similar glycemic progression. Since most such people are asymptomatic at diagnosis, active case detection programs would be required to identify them.", "Forty-two obese subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus had their plasma insulin, C peptide, and glucose levels measured after an overnight fast and in response to a 75-g oral glucose loading. Subjects were then prospectively followed up with dietary treatment, and the same measurements were repeated at 1 year. Although insulin values tended to be lower with greater fasting hyperglycemia at baseline, no correlation was observed among three parameters. However, near-normalization of glycemia (measured as the level of hemoglobin A1) was associated with significantly higher fasting and stimulated plasma insulin concentrations. Sixteen subjects were matched to each other for equivalent baseline hyperglycemia (by glycosylated hemoglobin) and divided into group 1 (normalization of the hemoglobin A1 value to 7.0% +/- 0.3% [mean +/- SE]) and group 2 (persistent hyperglycemia) (hemoglobin A1 value, 10.7% +/- 0.7% [mean +/- SE]). Before dietary therapy, the plasma insulin concentrations were twofold to threefold higher in group 1, and despite similar degrees of weight loss, group 2 failed to demonstrate improved glycemia. We concluded that the outcome of diet therapy for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is dependent on the duration of diabetes and endogenous insulin secretory reserve. There is a subgroup of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in whom delayed dietary intervention may have a beneficial effect.", "BACKGROUND: To evaluate whether preoperative measurement of fasting plasma C-peptide levels is useful to predict diabetes outcome after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diabetes outcome after RYGB was evaluated in 126 obese patients: 41 non-diabetic controls (NDC), 29 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 56 had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Body weight, fasting plasma glucose, fasting C-peptide levels, and HbA1c were measured at baseline and 3.6 +/- 0.16 years after GBS. Complete resolution of diabetes was defined as: fasting glucose <7.0 mmol/l, HbA1c <6.5 %, achieved without anti-diabetic medication. RESULTS: Patients with complete resolution of diabetes had a more recent diagnosis of T2DM, lower preoperative HbA1c levels and lower daily doses of metformin and insulin use. These parameters were related to postoperative HbA1c levels but they failed to mark the specific patients who had not reached complete resolution of T2DM. Fasting preoperative C-peptide levels had better predictive power: 90 % of T2DM patients with preoperative fasting C-peptide levels >1.0 nmol/l achieved a postoperative HbA1c <6.5 %, and 74 % achieved complete resolution of their diabetes. In contrast, none of the T2DM patients with a preoperative fasting C-peptide <1.0 nmol/l attained these goals. CONCLUSIONS: A preoperative fasting plasma C-peptide level <1.0 nmol/l in severely obese T2DM patients indicates partial beta-cell failure, and is associated with a markedly reduced chance of complete resolution of T2DM after RYGB. We therefore advocate measuring C-peptide levels in all diabetic patients up for bariatric surgery to improve the prediction of outcome.", "BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the therapeutic efficacy of acarbose and metformin is correlated with baseline HbA1c levels in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Data for 711 subjects were retrieved from the MARCH (Metformin and AcaRbose in Chinese as initial Hypoglycemic treatment) trial database and reviewed retrospectively. Patients were grouped according to baseline HbA1c levels (<7%, 7%-8%, and >8%) and the results for these three groups were compared between acarbose and metformin treatments. RESULTS: Acarbose and metformin treatment significantly improved T2DM-associated parameters (weight, fasting plasma glucose [FPG], postprandial glucose [PPG], glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1], HOMA-IR, and total cholesterol) across all HbA1c levels. Acarbose decreased PPG and HOMA-beta significantly more than metformin, but only in subjects with lower baseline HbA1c (PPG in the <7% and 7%-8%, HOMA-beta in the <7% groups; all P < 0.05). Acarbose decreased triglyceride (TG) levels, and the areas under the curve (AUC) for insulin and glucagon more than metformin at all HbA1c levels (P < 0.05). After 24 weeks treatment, metformin decreased FPG levels significantly more than acarbose for all baseline HbA1c groups (all P < 0.001). With the exception of FPG, PPG, and TG levels, differences between the two treatment groups observed at 24 weeks were not detected at 48 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Acarbose decreased PPG and TG and spared the AUC for insulin more effectively in patients with low-to-moderate baseline HbA1c levels, whereas metformin induced greater reductions in FPG. These results may help guide selection of initial therapy based on baseline HbA1c.", "AIM: Pioglitazone (PIO) has been shown to decrease insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes, resulting in lowered blood glucose concentrations, lowered plasma insulin levels and lowered haemoglobin A1C (A1C) values. Postprandial glucose control has been recently recognized as an important target for reducing overall glycemic burden in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some authors assert that reductions in postprandial glucose levels may lead to a decrease in cardiovascular risk, one of the major complications associated with diabetes. METHODS: Data were analysed from a 26-week PIO monotherapy study of 88 patients who underwent a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (75 g dose) at baseline and last measurement. Change from baseline in area under the curve (AUC) values and hourly glucose concentrations were calculated and analysed at both time points for four medication groups: placebo group and PIO 15, 30 and 45 mg groups. Changes from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and A1C also were reported. RESULTS: Glucose AUC was significantly (p < 0.05) different from baseline at 15, 30 and 45 mg doses of PIO. In addition, when compared to placebo, PIO (15, 30 and 45 mg) significantly decreased post-challenge blood glucose AUC (p < 0.05). The mean hourly blood glucose levels at last measurement for PIO 15, 30 and 45 mg all were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than placebo at all four time points. In addition, PIO significantly (p < 0.05) reduced FPG and A1C from baseline to last measurement in a dose-related fashion. CONCLUSIONS: PIO significantly reduced post-challenge glucose levels following an oral glucose challenge, leading to improvements in overall glycemic control. Postprandial glucose lowering is one of several metabolic effects of PIO in addition to decreasing insulin resistance and improving some lipids components. Whether these combined metabolic effects can lead to cardiovascular risk reductions may be confirmed by the pending results of cardiovascular outcomes studies with PIO."]}
{"question": "Do elderly patients call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Among patients with acute stroke symptoms, delay in hospital admission is the main obstacle for the use of thrombolytic therapy and other interventions associated with decreased mortality and disability. The primary aim of this study was to assess whether an elderly clinical population correctly endorsed the response to call for emergency services when presented with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study among elderly out-patients (>/=60 years) in Buenos Aires, Argentina randomly recruited from a government funded health clinic. The correct endorsement of intention to call 911 was assessed with the Stroke Action Test and the cut-off point was set at >/=75%. Knowledge of stroke and clinical and socio-demographic indicators were also collected and evaluated as predictors of correct endorsement using logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 367 elderly adults, 14% correctly endorsed intention to call 911. Presented with the most typical signs and symptoms, only 65% reported that they would call an ambulance. Amaurosis Fugax was the symptom for which was called the least (15%). On average, the correct response was chosen only 37% of the time. Compared to lower levels of education, higher levels were associated to correctly endorsed intention to call 911 (secondary School adjusted OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.59-7.86 and Tertiary/University adjusted OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.12-8.21).

To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis. CASE REPORT: A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal. CONCLUSION: [corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis."]}
{"question": "Do overweight children necessarily make overweight adults?", "retrieved_passages": ["Obesity in children has an increased risk to persist in adulthood. In most cases, obesity starts to develop in children at school age. Lower social economic status and migration background are severe risk factors for obesity. Additionally, genetic predisposition for the development of obesity plays an especially important role in children and adolescents. However, the individual cause for obesity is heterogeneous and complex. This is the reason why only a systematic analysis of individually existing problems is necessary for a differentiated and realistic planning of the treatment. Long-lasting therapy concepts need to be based on current available evidence.The treatment of childhood obesity should rely on multiprofessional lifestyle programs. An exception might be rare monogenic or syndromic forms of obesity, because defects within the central regulatory pathways of body weight regulation could be present. In general, a key component of the treatment strategy should include an improvement of nutrition, physical exercise and self-esteem combined with a reduction of stress. Moreover, the inclusion of parents into the treatment strategy has shown to be beneficial and necessary. Long-term follow-up studies on the development of associated comorbidities are rare. Unfortunately, patient groups at risk are currently not necessarily reached with available treatment programs.A multiprofessional analysis of individual problems and differentiated treatment planning with a participative approach (acknowledging the cultural background and involving members of the family) should lead to long-lasting improvement of the therapeutic outcome. The individual main treatment aim should also include - apart from the reduction of body weight - the improvement of associated comorbidities and quality of life, especially by avoiding any stigmatization. A health-promoting environment is desirable for this salutogenetic approach.", "Childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity is an important and increasingly prevalent public health problem in Canada and worldwide. High adiposity in youth is indicated in clinical practice by plotting body mass index on appropriate percentile charts normed for age and sex, although waist measures might be a further tool. High adiposity can lead to adiposopathy in youth, with associated increases in inflammation and oxidative stress, changes in adipokines, and endocrinopathy. This is manifest as cardiometabolic risk factors in similar patterns to those in noted in obese adults. Obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors have been shown to be associated with vascular changes indicative of early atherosclerosis, and ventricular hypertrophy, dilation, and dysfunction. These cardiovascular consequences are evident in youth, but childhood obesity is also predictive of similar consequences in adulthood. Childhood obesity and risk factors have been shown to track into adulthood and worsen in most individuals. The result is an exponential acceleration of atherosclerosis, which can be predicted to translate into an epidemic of premature cardiovascular disease and events. A change in paradigm is needed toward preventing and curing atherosclerosis and not just preventing cardiovascular disease. This would necessarily create an imperative for preventing and treating childhood obesity. Urgent attention, policy, and action are needed to avoid the enormous future social and health care costs associated with the cardiovascular consequences of obesity in youth.", "The number of US children who are overweight has more than doubled over the last decade. This change has broadened the focus of dietary guidance for children to address nutrient overconsumption and physical activity patterns. Total fat consumption expressed as a percentage of energy intake has decreased among US children. However, this decrease is largely the result of increased total energy intake in the form of carbohydrates and not necessarily due to decreased fat consumption. The majority of children aged 5-17 years are not meeting recommendations for Ca intakes. Much of this deficit is attributed to changing beverage consumption patterns, characterized by declining milk intakes and substantial increases in soft-drink consumption. On average, US children are not eating the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables. US adolescents become less active as they get older, and one-quarter of all US children watch > or = 4 h television each day, which is positively associated with increased BMI and skinfold thickness. There is an urgent need in the USA for effective prevention strategies aimed at helping children grow up with healthful eating and physical activity habits to achieve optimal health.", "PURPOSE: There has been a wealth of work on the weight outcomes of autistic children and young people, generally finding that they are more likely to be overweight or obese than their non-autistic counterparts. There has not been the same focussed study of the weight outcomes of autistic adults, however. This study, therefore, sought to examine the relationship between weight outcome and being autistic in adults. METHODS: Data were collected as part of an online study looking at eating, autism, and relationships. 665 people gave demographic and mental health information, and group differences and robust regressions were conducted. RESULTS: Autistic adults were more likely to be in non-healthy weight categories than their non-autistic counterparts, i.e., more likely to be underweight, overweight, or obese. There were no interactions between autism status and mental health impacting BMI, although both anxiety and depression predicted higher BMI in the sample overall. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that while some weight patterns from childhood and adolescence continue into adulthood for autistic individuals, this is not necessarily a straightforward picture, and would benefit from further in-depth and qualitative study to understand the processes at play. The lack of interactions between mental health and autism, however, should provide professionals with confidence in supporting healthy weight management among autistic people. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, cohort study.", "Infants born heavy are vulnerable to later obesity, but it is unknown whether obesity-related risk factors present between conception and delivery predict their postnatal weight trajectory. We modelled the weight trajectories of infants born high birth weight (HBW, greater than or equal to 4000 g) and/or large for gestational age (LGA, greater than 90th percentile) using data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (N = 371). A high percentage of infants were both HBW and LGA, but the trajectories were modelled separately. Weight of infants born heavy begins high, gradually decreases, and then levels off by 12 months. Delivery method was the only predictor of weight. Caesarean-delivered HBW infants were heavier than vaginally-delivered HBW infants although this effect disappeared by 12 months. Findings indicate that early-life influences are not necessarily deterministic of the postnatal weight trajectory of infants born heavy. Future research is needed to examine postnatal behaviours that may be implicated in the relationship between large size at birth and later obesity."]}
{"question": "Does a history of unintended pregnancy lessen the likelihood of desire for sterilization reversal?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Unintended pregnancy has been significantly associated with subsequent female sterilization. Whether women who are sterilized after experiencing an unintended pregnancy are less likely to express desire for sterilization reversal is unknown. METHODS: This study used national, cross-sectional data collected by the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth. The study sample included women ages 15-44 who were surgically sterile from a tubal sterilization at the time of interview. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between a history of unintended pregnancy and desire for sterilization reversal while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: In this nationally representative sample of 1,418 women who were sterile from a tubal sterilization, 78% had a history of at least one unintended pregnancy and 28% expressed a desire to have their sterilization reversed. In unadjusted analysis, having a prior unintended pregnancy was associated with higher odds of expressing desire for sterilization reversal (odds ratio [OR]: 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-2.79). In adjusted analysis controlling for sociodemographic factors, unintended pregnancy was no longer significantly associated with desire for reversal (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 0.91-2.34).

STUDY DESIGN: Metabolic screening results were obtained from the Alabama State Lab for all infants born at our hospital between 8/1/97, and 1/31/99, and were matched with an existing database of early discharge infants. An early newborn discharge was defined as a discharge between 24 and 47 hours of age. Metabolic screening tests included phenylketonuria (PKU), hypothyroidism, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Early discharge and traditional stay infants were compared to determine the percentage of newborns screened and the timing of the first adequate specimen. RESULTS: The state laboratory received specimens from 3860 infants; 1324 were on early discharge newborns and 2536 infants in the traditional stay group. At least one filter paper test (PKU, hypothyroidism, and CAH) was collected on 99.2% of early discharge infants and 96.0% of traditional stay infants (P<.0001). Early discharge infants had a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate (22.9%) compared with traditional stay infants (14.3%, P<.0001) but had a higher rate of repeat specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate (85.0% early discharge vs 75.3% traditional stay, P=.002). The early discharge group was more likely to have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life (1001, 98.8% early discharge vs 2016, 96.7% traditional stay, P=.0005). CONCLUSIONS: In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge."]}
{"question": "Does increasing blood pH stimulate protein synthesis in dialysis patients?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Although the mechanism of muscle wasting in end-stage renal disease is not fully understood, there is increasing evidence that acidosis induces muscle protein degradation and could therefore contribute to the loss of muscle protein stores of patients on hemodialysis, a prototypical state of chronic metabolic acidosis (CMA). Because body protein mass is controlled by the balance between synthesis and degradation, protein loss can occur as result of either increased breakdown, impaired synthesis, or both. Correction of acidosis may therefore help to maintain muscle mass and improve the health of patients with CMA. We evaluated whether alkalizing patients on hemodialysis might have a positive effect on protein synthesis and on nutritional parameters. METHODS: Eight chronic hemodialysis patients were treated daily with oral sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) supplementation for 10-14 days, yielding a pre-dialytic plasma bicarbonate concentration of 28.6 +/-1.6 mmol/l. The fractional synthesis rates (FSR) of muscle protein and albumin were obtained by the L-[(2)H(5)ring]phenylalanine flooding technique. RESULTS: Oral NaHCO(3 )supplementation induced a significant increase in serum bicarbonate (21.5 +/- 3.4 vs. 28.6 +/- 1.6 mmol/l; p = 0.018) and blood pH (7.41 vs. 7.46; p = 0.041). The FSR of muscle protein and the FSR of albumin did not change significantly (muscle protein: 2.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.5% per day, p = 0.39; albumin: 8.3 +/- 2.2 vs. 8.6 +/- 2.5% per day, p = 0.31). Plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 decreased significantly (33.4 +/- 21.3 vs. 25.4 +/- 12.3 nmol/l; p = 0.028), whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxin and free triiodothyronine did not change significantly and nutritional parameters showed no improvement. CONCLUSION: In contrast to other findings, raising the blood pH of dialysis patients was not associated with a positive effect on albumin and muscle protein synthesis, or nutritional and endocrinal parameters.", "Serum albumin concentration has been strongly associated with risk of death in hemodialysis patients, with mortality increasing as albumin decreases. Metabolic acidosis stimulates protein catabolism and decreases protein synthesis. A study was undertaken to investigate the effect of increasing predialysis serum bicarbonate (HCO3) concentrations on the nutrition of hemodialysis patients as measured by albumin and total lymphocyte count (TLC). Metabolic acidosis was defined as a predialysis serum bicarbonate concentration of < or = 18 mEq/L. Thirty-six hemodialysis patients were enrolled in the study. Each had been stable on hemodialysis for > or = 3 months and each had a mean serum bicarbonate concentration of < or = 18 mEq/L on predialysis monthly laboratory values during the preceding 3 months. The subjects were randomized into 2 groups. The first group consisted of 18 control subjects who were dialyzed on a standard bicarbonate bath of 35 mEq/L. The second group consisted of 18 experimental patients who were dialyzed on a bicarbonate bath of 40 mEq/L. Subjects in the experimental group who had predialysis serum bicarbonate concentrations less than 22 mEq/L after 2 weeks on the higher bicarbonate bath were additionally supplemented with oral sodium bicarbonate at a dosage of 1 mEq/kg dry weight/d. Monthly predialysis laboratory values were checked for all subjects and included serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, and albumin. TLCs were obtained at the initiation and at the conclusion of the study. Intact parathyroid hormone, blood pressures, and interdialytic weight gains were also followed. The study lasted 16 weeks; 32 subjects completed the study (16 in each group). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at the initiation of the study. The serum bicarbonate concentrations were significantly different between the two groups at the end of the study (control HCO3 17.3 +/- 3.2 mEq/L v experimental HCO3 20.2 +/- 2.9 mEq/L; P = 0.01). Serum albumin concentrations and TLCs were not statistically different (P > 0.05) between the two groups at the end of the study (control albumin 3.88 +/- 0.28 g/dL v experimental albumin 3.76 +/- 0.26 g/dL and control TLC 1,780.0 +/- 779.4/mm3 v experimental TLC 2,020.1 +/- 888.0/mm3). Potassium, intact parathyroid hormone, interdialytic weight gain, blood pressures, Kt/Vs, and protein catabolic rates did not differ. We found that the change in serum bicarbonate concentration was well-tolerated and was without any demonstrable side effects. We conclude that increasing the serum bicarbonate concentration by 3 mEq/L for 16 weeks has no effect on the indicators of nutrition that we measured (serum albumin and TLC).", "Patients with peritoneal dialysis are at risk for malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia, which are indicators of poor outcome. Recently, it was shown that dialysis solutions containing amino acids (AAs) and glucose improve protein anabolism in peritoneal dialysis patients. We determined if the same solutions could increase the fractional synthesis rate of albumin along with whole-body protein synthesis. Changes in the fractional albumin synthetic rate reflect acute change in hepatic albumin synthesis. A random-order cross-over study compared the effects of Nutrineal (AA source) plus Physioneal (glucose) dialysate with Physioneal alone dialysate. Eight patients in the overnight fasting state were compared to 12 patients in the daytime-fed state. Fractional albumin synthetic rate and whole-body protein synthesis were determined simultaneously using a primed-continuous infusion of L-[1-(13)C]-leucine. Fractional albumin synthesis on AAs plus glucose dialysis did not differ significantly from that on glucose alone in the fasting or the fed state. Protein intake by itself (fed versus fasting) failed to induce a significant increase in the fractional synthetic rate of albumin. Conversely, the oral protein brought about a significant stimulation of whole-body protein synthesis. Our findings show that the supply of AAs has different effects on whole-body protein synthesis and the fractional synthetic rate of albumin.", "Whether changes in substrate and insulin levels that occur during peritoneal dialysis (PD) have effects on muscle protein dynamics was evaluated by studying muscle protein synthesis (PS), breakdown (PB), and net protein balance (NB) by the forearm perfusion method associated with the kinetics of 3H-phenylalanine in acute, crossover studies in which PD patients served as their own controls. Studies were performed (1) in the basal state and during PD with dialysates that contained dextrose alone in different concentrations (protocol 1: eight patients), (2) during PD with dialysates that contained dextrose alone or dextrose and amino acids (AA) (protocol 2: five patients), and (3) in time controls (five patients). PD with dextrose alone induced (1) a two- to threefold increase in insulin, as well as a 20 to 25% decrease in AA, mainly BCAA, levels; (2) an insulin-related decline (-18%) in forearm PB (P<0.002); (3) a 20% decrease in muscle PS (P<0.04), which was related to arterial BCAA and K+ (P<0.02 to 0.05); (4) a persistent negative NB; and (5) a decrease in the efficiency of muscle protein turnover, expressed as the ratio NB/PB. PD with dextrose+AA versus PD with dextrose induced (1) similarly high insulin levels but with a significant increase in total arterial AA (+30 to 110%), mainly valine; (2) a reduced release of AA from muscle (P<0.05); and (3) a decrease in the negative NB observed during PD with dextrose, owing to an increase (approximately 20%) in muscle PS, without any further effect on muscle PB. This study indicates that in PD patients in the fasting state, the moderate hyperinsulinemia that occurs during PD with dextrose alone causes an antiproteolytic action that is obscured by a parallel decrease in AA availability for PS. Conversely, the combined use of dextrose and AA results in a cumulative effect, because of the suppression of endogenous muscle PB (induced by insulin) and the stimulation of muscle PS (induced by AA availability). The hypothesis, therefore, is that in patients who are treated with PD, when fasting or when nutrient intake is reduced, muscle mass could be maintained better by the combined use of dextrose and AA.", "The hemodialysis (HD) procedure has been implicated as a potential catabolic factor predisposing the chronic HD (CHD) patients to protein calorie malnutrition. To assess the potential effects of HD on protein and energy metabolism, we studied 11 CHD patients 2 h before, during, and 2 h after HD by use of primed constant infusion of L-[1-13C]leucine and L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine. Our results showed that HD led to increased whole body (10%) and muscle protein (133%) proteolysis. Simultaneously, whole body protein synthesis did not change, and forearm synthesis increased (120%). The net result was increased net whole body protein loss (96%) and net forearm protein loss (164%). During the 2-h post-HD period, the muscle protein breakdown trended toward baseline, whereas whole body protein breakdown increased further. Substrate oxidation during the post-HD was significantly altered, with diminished carbohydrate and accelerated lipid and amino acid oxidation. These data demonstrate that hemodialysis is an overall catabolic event, decreasing the circulating amino acids, accelerating rates of whole body and muscle proteolysis, stimulating muscle release of amino acids, and elevating net whole body and muscle protein loss."]}
{"question": "Can T-cell deficiency affect spatial learning ability following toluene exposure?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The present studywas designed to investigate the possible role of T cells in spatial learning ability in mouse after toluene exposure. METHOD: Eight-week-old male wild-type (WT) and nude mice of BALB/c strain were exposed to toluene (0, 9 and 90 ppm) in a nose-only exposure chamber for 30 min per day for 3 consecutive days and then once per week for 4 weeks. Twenty-four hours after the completion of exposure, we examined the spatial learning ability in each mouse using the Morris water maze apparatus. RESULTS: In the acquisition phase, a longer escape latency was observed in nude mice exposed to 90 ppm toluene on days 3 and 4 when compared with corresponding WT mice. However, the effect of toluene on the escape latency was not significant in nude mice. In the probe trial, WT mice exposed to 90 ppm toluene showed poor retention memory compared with the control group. In the reversal phase, we did not find any significant difference between groups. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure."]}
{"question": "Is there a relationship between homocysteine and vitiligo?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Pigmentary dilution is observed in patients with homocystinuria. Therefore, it is possible that an increase of local homocysteine (Hcy) interferes with normal melanogenesis and plays a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Vitamin B12 and folic acid, levels of which are decreased in vitiligo, are important cofactors in the metabolism of Hcy. Consequently, a nutritional deficiency in either of these two vitamins will result in an increase in homocysteine in the circulation, a finding that we expect to find in vitiligo. OBJECTIVE: To determine the level of Hcy in the blood of patients with vitiligo as a first step in revealing if it has any relationship with the pathogenesis of vitiligo and consequently if this will have an impact on the treatment of vitiligo. METHODS: Twenty-six patients of both sexes with vitiligo (age range 20-50 years, mean 31.4 +/- 8.09) and 26 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. After excluding factors that may affect serum Hcy levels, blood samples from patients and controls were obtained for homocysteine determination by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: The mean serum level of Hcy was significantly higher in patients with vitiligo than in controls (21.61 +/- 13.28 vs. 13.1 +/- 4.88 micromol L(-1); P < 0.001). The Hcy level was significantly higher in male patients than in female patients (28.67 +/- 15.95 vs. 15.56 +/- 6.2 micromol L(-1); P < 0.001) and in male controls compared with female controls (15.07 +/- 4.61 vs. 12.05 +/- 4.82 micromol L(-1); P < 0.001). The homocysteine level was related to the activity of vitiligo and was significantly higher in patients with progressive disease than in controls (25.4 +/- 14.99 vs. 13.1 +/- 4.88 micromol L(-1); P < 0.001). No significant difference in Hcy levels was found between either untreated vitiligo patients (22.77 +/- 13.36 micromol L(-1)) or patients receiving ultraviolet therapy (20.45 +/- 13.73 micromol L(-1)) and the total patient group (21.62 +/- 13.28 micromol L(-1)). CONCLUSION: An elevated homocysteine level may be a precipitating factor for vitiligo in predisposed individuals. In view of the biological role of vitamin B(12) and folic acid in Hcy metabolism, we present our recommendations regarding the investigation and treatment of this common disease.", "The aim of this study was to determine serum vitamin B12, folic acid and homocysteine (Hcy) levels as well as MTHFR (C677, A1298C) gene polymorphisms in patients with vitiligo, and to compare the results with healthy controls. Forty patients with vitiligo and 40 age and sex matched healthy subjects were studied. Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma Hcy levels and MTHFR polymorphisms were determined by chemiluminescence and real time PCR methods, respectively. Mean serum vitamin B12 and Hcy levels were not significantly different while folic acid levels were significantly lower in the control group. There was no significant relationship between disease activity and vitamin B12, folic acid and homocystein levels. No significant difference in C677T gene polymorphism was detected. Heterozygote A1298C gene polymorphism in the patient group was statistically higher than the control group. There was no significant relationship between MTHFR gene polymorphisms and vitamin B12, folic acid and homocysteine levels. In conclusion, vitamin B12, folate and Hcy levels are not altered in vitiligo and MTHFR gene mutations (C677T and A1298C) do not seem to create susceptibility for vitiligo."]}
{"question": "Does a delay in transfer to a rehabilitation unit for older people affect outcome after fracture of the proximal femur?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIMS: To detemine the relationship between delay in transfer to rehabilitation wards and outcome for patients aged over 75 years with fracture of the proximal femur. METHODS: An observational study in a district general hospital of all patients admitted to hospital aged over 75 years with fracture of the proximal femur over 3 1/2 years. Outcome data collected included the number of patients discharged back to their usual residence and total hospital length of stay related to age, gender, usual residence and delay in transfer to a rehabilitation ward. RESULTS: 58% of 455 patients were transferred to a rehabilitation ward. For those patients who were transferred to a rehabilitation ward only age predicted discharge to a more dependent residence. The relative risk for discharge to a more dependent residence for people aged over 85 years compared to younger people was 1.47 (95% CI 1.15-1.88). Delay in transfer to rehabilitation was associated with a longer total hospital length of stay of 0.64 (95% CI 0.23-1.05) days per day of delay in transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Delay in transfer to a rehabilitation ward was associated with a disproportionate increase in total hospital length of stay for patients aged over 75 with fracture of the proximal femur."]}
{"question": "Does the treatment of amblyopia normalise subfoveal choroidal thickness in amblyopic children?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Recent studies using optical coherence tomography (OCT) have indicated that choroidal thickness (CT) in the anisometropic amblyopic eye is thicker than that of the fellow and normal control eyes. However, it has not yet been established as to how amblyopia affects the choroid thickening. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of amblyopia treatment on macular CT in eyes with anisometropic amblyopia using swept-source OCT. METHODS: Thirteen patients (mean age: 6.2 +/- 2.4 years) with hypermetropic anisometropic amblyopia were included in this study. Visual acuity (VA), axial length (AL), and CT were measured at the enrollment visit and at the final visit, after at least 6 months of treatment. CT measurements were corrected for magnification error and were automatically analyzed using built-in software and divided into three macular regions (subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), center 1 mm, and center 6 mm). A one-way analysis of covariance using AL as a covariate was performed to determine whether CT in amblyopic eyes changed after amblyopia treatment. RESULTS: The average observation period was 22.2 +/- 11.0 months. After treatment, VA (logMAR) improvement in the amblyopic eyes was 0.41 +/- 0.19 (p < 0.001). SFCT, center 1 mm CT, and center 6 mm CT were significantly thicker in the amblyopic eyes compared with the fellow eyes both before and after treatment (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). There were no significant changes in SFCT, center 1 mm CT, or center 6 mm CT before and after treatment in the amblyopic (p = 0.25, 0.21, and 0.84, respectively) and fellow (p = 0.75, 0.84, and 0.91, respectively) eyes. The correlation between changes in logMAR versus changes in CT after treatment was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Although VA in amblyopic eyes was significantly improved after treatment, the choroid thickening of anisometropic amblyopic eyes persisted, and there was no significant change found in the CT after the treatment. Our findings suggest that thickening of the CT in amblyopia is not directly related to visual dysfunction.", "PURPOSE: Recent studies have found a choroidal thickening in amblyopic eyes and suggested that there might be a relationship between the choroid and amblyopia. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a six-month treatment of amblyopia on choroidal thickness in anisometropic hyperopic amblyopic children. METHODS: Thirty-two anisometropic hyperopic children with unilateral amblyopia were included in this prospective study. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was measured as the distance between the retinal pigment epithelium and the chorioscleral edge, by using spectral domain enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography. The treatment of amblyopia was performed based on the full correction of the refractive error with eyeglasses, a refractive adaptation phase and occlusion by patching the fellow eye. RESULTS: The mean visual acuity of the amblyopic eyes significantly increased from 0.35 +/- 0.3 to 0.16 +/- 0.2 logMAR after the treatment (p < 0.001). The mean initial choroidal thickness was significantly higher in the amblyopic eyes than in the fellow eyes (p = 0.019). There were no significant differences between the pre- and post-treatment mean choroidal thickness in the amblyopic eyes (p = 0.428) and in the fellow eyes (p = 0.343). The mean choroidal thickness was still higher in the amblyopic eyes than in the fellow eyes after the treatment (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Although a six-month treatment of amblyopia increased the visual acuity of the anisometropic hyperopic amblyopic eyes, it could not significantly change choroidal thickness. Our results were in accordance with the conventional explanation, which suggests visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus abnormalities in the pathophysiology of amblyopia."]}
{"question": "A comparison of 500 prefilled textured saline breast implants versus 500 standard textured saline breast implants: is there a difference in deflation rates?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: This study provides the first large-volume (1000 implant) comparison of the deflation rates of Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured saline breast implants versus a control group of Mentor Siltex textured saline implants. METHODS: A consecutive series of 500 Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured saline breast implants was compared with a consecutive series of 500 Mentor Siltex breast implants. Each breast implant was evaluated for a 4-year period, and the annual deflation rate (number of deflations during a given year divided by the total number of implants) and cumulative deflation rate (cumulative total of deflations through a given year divided by the total number of implants) were recorded. Statistical significance was calculated using the Fisher's exact test at year 1 and the chi-square analysis at years 2 through 4. RESULTS: The cumulative deflation rates of the Poly Implant Prosthesis implants was as follows: year 1, 1.2 percent; year 2, 5.6 percent; year 3, 11.4 percent; and year 4, 15.4 percent. The cumulative deflation rates of the Mentor implants was: year 1, 0.2 percent; year 2, 0.6 percent; year 3, 1.6 percent; and year 4, 4.4 percent. At year 1, the difference between deflation rates was not statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p > 0.05). However, at year 2 (chi-square, 13.29; p < 0.001), year 3 (chi-square, 37.91; p < 0.001), and year 4 (chi-square, 32.69; p < 0.001), the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: There was a statistically significant difference between the overall deflation rates of Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured saline breast implants and Mentor Siltex breast implants at year 2, year 3, and year 4. After 4 years, the 15.56 percent cumulative deflation rate of Poly Implant Prosthesis implants was over 3.5 times higher than the 4.31 percent deflation rate of the Mentor Siltex implants. There may be several factors contributing to the higher deflation rate seen in Poly Implant Prosthesis implants, including possible in vitro deflation before implantation and silicone shell curing technique. Nevertheless, this statistically significant deflation difference must be taken into account when balancing the risks and benefits of Poly Implant Prosthesis breast implants."]}

Migration started in the esophagus in two, one going to the aorta and the other to the neck area. In the other two, migration started in the pharynx, and the FB moved towards the prevertebral fascia and the other externalized in the submandibular region. The mechanisms and the risks posed to the patient, by FB migration, and the way to diagnose them are hereby discussed.

Her medical history revealed an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia caused by arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy for which an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted with epicardial patches. On 2D echocardiography, a mobile piece of lead was seen in the right atrium and right ventricle, loosely attached to the free wall of the right ventricule; 3D reconstruction confirmed this suggestion. Remarkably, the lead disappeared while performing the echocardiogram. A pulmonary artery fluoroscopy was performed. It had positioned itself in the right pulmonary artery. The lead could be extracted from the right pulmonary artery using an extraction device. We suggest that during a period of frequent bending physical activity, the lead must have started its journey by perforating through the free wall of the right ventricle and had then been carried away by the blood flow towards the right pulmonary artery. The lead must be a residue of an epicardial defibrillation lead, which has not been removed completely after the heart transplantation performed 10 years earlier.

{"question": "Is there a relationship between serum paraoxonase level and epicardial fat tissue thickness?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to show the relationship between serum paraoxonase 1 level and the epicardial fat tissue thickness. METHODS: Two hundred and seven patients without any atherosclerotic disease history were included in this cross-sectional observational study. Correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness, which was measured by echocardiography and serum paraoxonase 1 level. Also correlation analysis was performed to show correlation between patients' clinical and laboratory findings and the level of serum paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) and the epicardial fat tissue thickness. Pearson and Spearman test were used for correlation analysis. RESULTS: No linear correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness and serum PON 1 found (correlation coefficient: -0.127, p=0.069). When epicardial fat tissue thickness were grouped as 7 mm and over, and below, and 5 mm and over, and below, serum PON 1 level were significantly lower in >/=7 mm group (PON1 : 168.9 U/L) than <7 mm group (PON 1: 253.9 U/L) (p<0.001).

Serum triglyceride was found to be higher in >/=7 mm group (p=0.014), body mass index was found higher in >/=5 mm group (p=0.006). CONCLUSION: Serum PON 1 level is not correlated with the epicardial fat tissue thickness. But PON 1 level is lower in patients with epicardial fat tissue thickness 7 mm and over.

We investigated the effects calibration in routine clinical LC-MS/MS assays. METHODS: All LC-MS/MS users that were registered with the UKNEQAS external quality assurance scheme for testosterone were invited to take part in the study. A set of seven serum samples and serum-based calibrators were sent to all laboratories that expressed an interest. The laboratories were instructed to analyse all samples using there own calibrators and return the results and a method questionnaire for analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen laboratories took part in the study. There was no consensus on supplier of testosterone or matrix for the preparation of calibrators and all were prepared in-house. Also, a wide variety of mass spectrometers, internal standards, chromatography conditions and sample extractions were used. The variation in results did not improve when the results were corrected with a common calibrator. CONCLUSIONS: The variation in results obtained could not be attributed to variations in calibrators. The differences in methodologies between laboratories must be the reason for this variation."]}
{"question": "Are complex coronary lesions more frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Coronary atherosclerotic burden is excessive in diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent predictor for both death and myocardial infarction. It is not known whether the prevalence of complex coronary lesions, such as bifurcation and ostial lesions, is different in diabetics from nondiabetics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of present study was to investigate the prevalence of these lesions in patients with DM. METHODS: One thousand fourteen consecutive patients (mean age 61.3+/-10.7 years) were investigated. Coronary angiograms were examined for bifurcation and ostial lesions using a digital quantitative system. Patients were classified as diabetic (n=281) or nondiabetic (n=733). RESULTS: Patient mean age, and rates of hypertension and hyperlipidemia were significantly higher in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (P<0.0001), although smoking was significantly lower (P=0.001). Reasons for coronary angiography and treatment were comparable between the two groups. The prevalence of bifurcation lesions and ostial lesions was significantly greater in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (9.8% versus 4.3% [P=0.001] and 38.4% versus 29.2% [P=0.003] in the diabetic group versus the nondiabetic group). The presence of DM and greater age were found to be independent predictors for bifurcation lesions (OR=2.27 [P=0.004] and OR=1.03 [P=0.01], for DM and age, respectively) and ostial lesions (OR=1.40 [P=0.027] and OR=1.02 [P=0.001], for DM and age, respectively) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Complex coronary lesions such as bifurcation and ostial lesions were significantly more common in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients. Greater age and the presence of DM were independent predictors for these complex lesions. These results may help to explain the poor prognosis of coronary artery disease among diabetic patients.", "AIMS: The main cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the disruption of a thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) and subsequent thrombosis. Mortality increases in diabetic patients due to cardiovascular events; there may be differences in the vulnerable plaques between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. We used optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess the incidence of vulnerable plaques in diabetic patients with AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: OCT was performed in all three major coronary arteries of 70 AMI patients: 48 non-diabetic and 22 diabetic patients. The OCT criterion for TCFA was the presence of both a lipid-rich plaque composition and a fibrotic cap thickness of <65 microm. A ruptured plaque contains a cavity in contact with a lumen and a residual fibrous cap. OCT identified 68 plaque ruptures (1.0 per patient; range, 0-3) and 162 TCFAs (2.3 per patient; range, 0-5). The incidences of plaque rupture and TCFA at culprit lesions were similar. However, non-culprit-lesion TCFAs were observed more frequently in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of vulnerable plaque in culprit lesions was similar between diabetic and non-diabetic patients, vulnerable plaques were observed in non-culprit lesions more in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients.", "Diabetes is recognised to increase morbidity and mortality after coronary revascularization. We compared clinical outcomes in mean 5-year-long follow-up of coronary balloon angioplasty in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. We studied 621 patients undergoing elective angioplasty from 1987 to 1996. There were 60 (9.7%) patients with diabetes who were compared with 561 non-diabetic patients. Diabetics were older, more often obese, less frequently were current smokers, and less frequently had hypercholesterolaemia. Diabetic patients in comparison with non-diabetics had lower ejection fraction and more frequently had angioplasty of complex (B2 or C) lesions, but there were no differences between both groups in the other clinical and angiographic risk factors. Clinical success of angioplasty, as well as complications rate were similar in both groups. In follow-up restenosis occurred more frequently in diabetics (46.3 vs. 32.2%, P=0.03), resulting in significantly higher re-intervention rate (50.0 vs. 35.4%, P=0.03). Especially diabetic patients were more frequently referred to CABG (20.4 vs. 9. 9%, P=0.02). There were no significant differences in deaths (1.9 vs. 2.8%) and myocardial infarction (3.7 vs. 4.4%). Diabetics presented worse CCS status at the end of observation (Class 0 and I - 61.1 vs. 74.4%, P=0.037). Angioplasty proved to be a safe procedure in diabetic patients. Despite higher restenosis and re-intervention rate in diabetics, mortality as well as myocardial infarction rate was the same in both groups during mean 5-year follow-up.", "This study investigated the distribution of risk factors, lesion characteristics and endovascular revascularization (EVR) strategies in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with vs without diabetes mellitus (DM). Data were collected within the RECcording COurses of vasculaR Diseases (RECCORD) registry. Demographic data, lesion localization (iliac vs femoropopliteal vs below-the-knee (BTK)) and lesion complexity score (LCS) based on number of affected segments, and lesion length (< 10 vs 10-20 vs > 20 cm), EVR strategies and peri-procedural complications were analysed in 786 patients with and 1337 without diabetes mellitus. Patients with diabetes mellitus were older (71.6 +/- 9.6 vs 69.4 +/- 10.5 years, P < .001) and had higher LCS and more often BTK lesions (P < .05 for all). Lesions were treated less frequently with stents (48.7 vs 59.6%, P < .001) in patients with diabetes mellitus, whereas a non-significant trend was noticed for higher DCB treatment rates (48.3 vs 44.4%, P = .07). Post-interventional ankle-brachial index (ABI) increase was similar (from .77 +/- .28 to .92 +/- .25 with diabetes mellitus and from .74 +/- .21 to .90 +/- .20 without diabetes mellitus, P < .001 for both). Peri-/post-procedural complications were low in both groups (4.6%). Patients with diabetes mellitus, who undergo endovascular revascularization are older, have more comorbidities and higher target lesion complexity. However, treatment success rates are similar and complication rates are low.", "Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) accelerates the prevalence of native coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO), and this kind of CTO shows extensive challenging and complex atherosclerotic pathology. As a result, the procedural success rate of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is inferior to another kind of lesions. The present meta-analysis aims to compare the lesion characteristics and procedural complications of CTO-PCI in patients with or without prior CABG. A total of 8 studies, comprising of 13439 patients, published from inception to August 2021 were included in this meta-analysis. Results were pooled using random effects model and are presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). From the 13439 patients enrolled, 3349 (24.9%) patients had previous CABG and 10090 (75.1%) formed the control group in our analysis.

{"question": "Are variations in the use of carotid endarterectomy explained by population Need?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: to describe variation in utilisation of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) within two English health regions and explore relationships between use, need and proximity to services. DESIGN: consecutive case series of operations. Comparison at a population level with district stroke mortality, hospital admissions and material deprivation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: standardised utilisation rates for CEA and measures of inter-district variability. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for associations between variables. RESULTS: variation in utilisation rates was considerable (14-fold difference across district populations). More individuals had bilateral surgery in the Yorkshire region than in the Northern (11.7% vs. 5.5%, p=0.002). There was no association between utilisation rates for CEA and district stroke mortality (r=-0.06, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.30) or admission rates for stroke (r=0.17, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.49). There was a strong relationship between residence in districts where services were located and higher utilisation. Rates of CEA were lowest in the regions' most affluent wards. CONCLUSION: use of CEA varies widely, depending on area of residence. Variation is not a consequence of differences in need, but reflects clinical practice and supply of services. There is evidence to suggest unmet need for CEA.", "OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to investigate variations between states and changes in state-specific carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and 30-day mortality rates. Cross-sectional variations and changes over time in such measures may be indicative of improvement in the quality of care. METHODS: We performed retrospective analyses of pre-existing administrative data on Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older in the United States. Age-adjusted, state-specific CEA rates and 30-day postoperative mortality rates in 1991, 1995 and 2000 were examined, as well as changes in these rates from 1991 to 1995 and from 1995 to 2000. Stroke mortality in the general population of each state was used as a crude measure of the need for CEA procedure in the state. The Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to study correlations between rates. Oldham's method was used to avoid the effect of regression to the mean. RESULTS: There were wide variations in the state-specific CEA rates, 30-day mortality, and in changes in these rates over time. The states with relatively low procedure rates in 1991 also had low rates in 1995 and 2000, and relatively higher increases in the rates. The states with relatively high 30-day mortality in 1991 or 1995 had lower increases or greater decreases in the rate. CEA rates were not correlated with any measure of surgical mortality, but they were correlated with stroke mortality in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The inter-state variation in CEA rates has not changed much since 1991, but variation in 30-day mortality decreased through 2000. The states with low procedure rates in 1991 did not have sufficient increase to catch up with the high-rate states by 1995, but they were prone to experience a higher increase in the subsequent 5 years. The validity of stroke mortality in a state as a measure of the need for CEA is questionable. Further research using clinical data is needed to better explain variations between states.", "BACKGROUND: Racial variation in the use of surgical procedures raises concern about equitable access. The goal of our study was to examine racial differences in utilization across a broad range of procedures in Massachusetts and to assess whether racial variation is related to physician discretion. METHODS: We obtained fiscal year 1988 hospital discharge data for all Massachusetts residents, identified 10 clinically important surgical procedures, and calculated age- and sex-adjusted rate ratios for white and black patients. Level of discretion was determined by using a modified Delphi technique. RESULTS: Whites had higher rates for eight procedures (abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, appendectomy, cardiac valve replacement, carotid endarterectomy, cholecystectomy, lumbar disk procedures, open reduction/internal fixation of the femur, and tonsillectomy) and lower rates for two procedures, hysterectomy and prostatectomy. Of the eight procedures for which utilization was higher among whites, four were ranked as moderate- or high-discretion procedures and four were ranked as low-discretion procedures. Hysterectomy, the only procedure for which utilization was substantially higher among blacks (white:black rate ratio < 0.90), was ranked as a high-discretion procedure. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of hysterectomy and prostatectomy, procedure rates for whites were greater than those for blacks for a wide range of surgical procedures. Racial variation exists for low-discretion procedures as well as for those associated with moderate and high discretion. Variation among low-discretion procedures that is not explained by medical need suggests the possibility of race-related differences in access to care or in the way patients and physicians make clinical decisions."]}
{"question": "Is expert breast pathology assessment necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ ?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Current guidelines include a recommendation that a pathologist with expertise in breast disease review all ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) specimens due to the presence of significant variability in pathologic reporting of DCIS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of pathologic reporting of DCIS over the past decade and to determine the current impact of expert breast pathology assessment on the management of DCIS. METHODS: All patients with a diagnosis of DCIS referred to a single regional cancer centre between 1982 and 2000 have been reviewed. Inter-observer variability between initial and secondary reports has been evaluated using kappa statistics. For each case, the Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI) using pathologic data obtained from the initial and reviewed pathology reports were compared. The impact of expert breast pathology on risk assessment and treatment was determined. RESULTS: 481 individuals with DCIS were referred and pathology review was performed on 350 patients (73%). Inter-observer agreement was high for the main pathologic features of DCIS. From 1996 to 2000, secondary pathology assessments lead to a change in the assessment of local recurrence risk in 100 cases (29%) and contributed to a change in treatment recommendation in 93 (43%) cases. CONCLUSION: Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "Our histopathologic criteria for diagnosing microinvasive carcinoma of the breast may be enunciated as follows: (1) cytologically malignant cells in the stroma associated with in situ carcinoma, (2) absence of basement membrane and myoepithelial cells around the invasive cells, (3) frequent accompanying stromal alterations in the form of myxomatous change and loosening of connective tissue, and (4) the frequent presence of an inflammatory cell infiltrate composed of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Most or all of these four features are present in cases of ductal microinvasive carcinoma of the breast, but the lobular type is not likely to be accompanied by stromal changes or a lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltrate. The minimum information regarding microinvasive carcinoma of the breast that should be conveyed in the final pathology report includes size as measured by the ocular micrometer or a statement that microinvasion refers to a lesion smaller than 1 mm, the number of foci of invasion, and the spatial distribution of the invasive foci. The nuclear grade of the invasive cells and the size, type, and nuclear grade of the accompanying DCIS should be specified. The status of margins, presence of vascular channel involvement (a rarity in microinvasive carcinoma of the breast), and degree of proliferative changes in adjacent nonneoplastic breast tissue should be reported. Immunostains for basement membrane and myoepithelial cells may be helpful in the diagnosis of microinvasive carcinoma of the breast. Sclerosing lesions such as radial scar and sclerosing adenosis can simulate microinvasive carcinoma of the breast, especially when the latter is associated with in situ carcinoma. Caution should be exercised in cases wherein in situ malignant cells may be dislodged by needling procedures or during dissection of the excised specimen. Cautery-induced artifacts also hinder optimal histologic assessment. In some cases, it is virtually impossible to determine if true invasion is present, and the statement \"microinvasive carcinoma of the breast cannot be entirely excluded\" may be employed as a last resort. We consider the latter diagnosis to be the last refuge of the diligent pathologist and do not recommend it unless all diagnostic measures, including examination of deeper levels and supplemental stains, have been exhausted. It may be necessary to seek an expert opinion in \"difficult\" cases, particularly in the event that therapeutic decisions are to be based on the determination of invasion. From a clinical perspective, the management of microinvasive carcinoma of the breast ought to be dictated by the individual circumstances in each case. Based on currently available data, which admittedly suffer from lack of diagnostic uniformity, the vast majority of patients with microinvasive carcinoma of the breast will be node-negative and can look forward to an excellent prognosis. It is hoped that since the UICC has adopted a previously recommended definition of microinvasive carcinoma of the breast, prospective or retrospective studies with uniform diagnostic criteria will be conducted that will enable more definitive conclusions regarding the treatment and prognosis of microinvasive carcinoma of the breast."]}
{"question": "Is decompressive surgery effective for spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive cervical myelopathy?", "retrieved_passages": ["STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective multicenter study of series of 12 patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis who underwent surgery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the postoperative outcomes of patients with cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive myelopathy and effect of decompressive surgery on the prognosis of sarcoidosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sarcoidosis is a chronic, multisystem noncaseating granulomatous disease. It is difficult to differentiate spinal cord sarcoidosis from cervical compressive myelopathy. There are no studies regarding the coexistence of compressive cervical myelopathy with cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis and the effect of decompressive surgery. METHODS: Nagoya Spine Group database included 1560 cases with cervical myelopathy treated with cervical laminectomy or laminoplasty from 2001 to 2005. A total of 12 patients (0.08% of cervical myelopathy) were identified spinal cord sarcoidosis treated with decompressive surgery. As a control subject, 8 patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis without compressive lesion who underwent high-dose steroid therapy without surgery were recruited. RESULTS: In the surgery group, enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were mostly seen at C5-C6, coincident with the maximum compression level in all cases. Postoperative recovery rates in the surgery group at 1 week and 4 weeks were -7.4% and -1.1%, respectively. Only 5 cases had showed clinical improvement, and the condition of these 5 patients had worsened again at averaged 7.4 weeks after surgery. Postoperative oral steroid therapy was initiated at an average of 6.4 weeks and the average initial dose was 54.0 mg in the surgery group, while 51.3 mg in the nonsurgery group. The recovery rate of the Japanese Orthopedic Association score, which increased after steroid therapy, was better in the nonsurgery group (62.5%) than in the surgery group (18.6%) with significant difference (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The effect of decompression for spinal cord sarcoidosis with compressive myelopathy was not evident. Early diagnosis for sarcoidosis from other organ and steroid therapy should be needed."]}
{"question": "Endovenous laser ablation in the treatment of small saphenous varicose veins: does site of access influence early outcomes?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The study was performed to evaluate the clinical and technical efficacy of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) of small saphenous varicosities, particularly in relation to the site of endovenous access. METHODS: Totally 59 patients with unilateral saphenopopliteal junction incompetence and small saphenous vein reflux underwent EVLA (810 nm, 14 W diode laser) with ambulatory phlebectomies. Small saphenous vein access was gained at the lowest site of truncal reflux. Patients were divided into 2 groups: access gained above mid-calf (AMC, n = 33) and below mid-calf (BMC, n = 26) levels. Outcomes included Venous Clinical Severity Scores (VCSS), Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), patient satisfaction, complications, and recurrence rates. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in VCSS, AVVQ, generic quality of life Short Form 36, and EuroQol scores (P < .05) up to 1 year. No differences were seen between AMC and BMC groups for complications (phlebitis: 2 [6%] and 1 [3.8%], P > .05; paresthesia: 2 [6%] and 5 [19%], P = .223) and recurrence (3 [9%] and 1 [3.8%], P = .623), respectively.

{"question": "Is the covering of the resection margin after distal pancreatectomy advantageous?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: In recent years, many advances in pancreatic surgery have been achieved. Nevertheless, the rate of pancreatic fistula following pancreatic tail resection does not differ between various techniques, still reaching up to 30% in prospective multicentric studies. Taking into account contradictory results concerning the usefulness of covering resection margins after distal pancreatectomy, we sought to perform a systematic, retrospective analysis of patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy at our center. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the data of 74 patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy between 2001 and 2011 at the community hospital in Neuss. Demographic factors, indications, postoperative complications, surgical or interventional revisions, and length of hospital stay were registered to compare the outcome of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy with coverage of the resection margins vs. patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy without coverage of the resection margins. Differences between groups were calculated using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Main indications for pancreatic surgery were insulinoma (n=18, 24%), ductal adenocarcinoma (n=9, 12%), non-single-insulinoma-pancreatogenic-hypoglycemia-syndrome (NSIPHS) (n=8, 11%), and pancreatic cysts with pancreatitis (n=8, 11%). In 39 of 74 (53%) patients no postoperative complications were noted. In detail we found that 23/42 (55%) patients with coverage vs. 16/32 (50%) without coverage of the resection margins had no postoperative complications. The most common complications were pancreatic fistulas in eleven patients (15%), and postoperative bleeding in nine patients (12%). Pancreatic fistulas occurred in patients without coverage of the resection margins in 7/32 (22%) vs. 4/42 (1011%) with coverage are of the resection margins, yet without reaching statistical significance. Postoperative bleeding ensued with equal frequency in both groups (12% with coverage versus 13% without coverage of the resection margins). The reoperation rate was 8%. The hospital stay for patients without coverage was 13 days (5-60) vs. 17 days (8-60) for patients with coverage. CONCLUSIONS: The results show no significant difference in the fistula rate after covering of the resection margin after distal pancreatectomy, which contributes to the picture of an unsolved problem."]}
{"question": "Does treatment duration affect outcome after radiotherapy for prostate cancer?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: The protraction of external beam radiotherapy (RT) time is detrimental in several disease sites. In prostate cancer, the overall treatment time can be considerable, as can the potential for treatment breaks. We evaluated the effect of elapsed treatment time on outcome after RT for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 1989 and November 2004, 1,796 men with prostate cancer were treated with RT alone. The nontreatment day ratio (NTDR) was defined as the number of nontreatment days divided by the total elapsed days of RT. This ratio was used to account for the relationship between treatment duration and total RT dose. Men were stratified into low risk (n = 789), intermediate risk (n = 798), and high risk (n = 209) using a single-factor model. RESULTS: The 10-year freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) rate was 68% for a NTDR <33% vs. 58% for NTDR >/=33% (p = 0.02; BF was defined as a prostate-specific antigen nadir + 2 ng/mL). In the low-risk group, the 10-year FFBF rate was 82% for NTDR <33% vs. 57% for NTDR >/=33% (p = 0.0019). The NTDR was independently predictive for FFBF (p = 0.03), in addition to T stage (p = 0.005) and initial prostate-specific antigen level (p < 0.0001) on multivariate analysis, including Gleason score and radiation dose. The NTDR was not a significant predictor of FFBF when examined in the intermediate-risk group, high-risk group, or all risk groups combined. CONCLUSIONS: A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of >/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to determine whether the extent of prostate radiotherapy (ie, whole-pelvic radiotherapy [WPRT] vs. prostate and seminal vesicle radiotherapy [PSVRT]) is associated with all-cause mortality (ACM) in men treated with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multiple-institution cohort of 3709 prostate cancer patients was prospectively assembled from 1991 to 2006. The median age was 72 years and all patients had T1c-T3N0M0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Patients were treated with WPRT or PSVRT followed by a brachytherapy boost, with or without neoadjuvant ADT (median duration, 4.2 months). Seventy percent of patients had unfavorable-risk disease (Gleason score >/= 7; prostate-specific antigen >/= 10 ng/mL; or stage >/= T2b). Cox regression was applied to determine whether the radiation treatment volume affected the risk of ACM. The interaction between radiation volume and ADT use was assessed. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 3.3 years, 561 deaths were observed. A decreased risk of ACM was noted with the use of WPRT versus PSVRT (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.89; P = .01), or with ADT use (AHR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.90; P = .004). However, a combination of WPRT and ADT did not further improve ACM compared with either WPRT alone or PSVRT with ADT. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between the radiotherapeutic treatment volume and ADT (AHR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.004-2.58; P = .048). CONCLUSION: Treatment with WPRT or short-course ADT is associated with a decreased risk of ACM, although a combination of the two does not yield greater benefit. This observation suggests a shared mechanism for this risk reduction, which we hypothesize to be via the treatment of micrometastatic disease within the pelvic lymph nodes.", "PURPOSE: To study the impact of biochemical failure on overall survival rates during the first 10 years after definitive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.

The median age of treatment was 69 years (range: 46-86 years). Pretreatment PSA levels (iPSA) and biopsy Gleason scores (bGS) were available for all cases. The clinical stage was T1/T2A in 63%, T2B/C in 27%, and T3 in 10%. The median iPSA level was 9.6 ng/mL (range: 0.4-692.9 ng/mL). The iPSA was < or =10 in 53% and >10 in 47%. The bGS was < or =6 in 59% and > or =7 in 41%. Androgen deprivation (AD) was administered in 181 cases (19%) for a median duration of 6 months (range: 1-6 months). All 181 cases received AD neoadjuvantly, i.e., before and/or during the radiotherapy. No AD was delivered after the completion of radiation. The median radiation dose was 70 Gy (range: 60-78 Gy). The radiotherapy technique was conformal in 376 (40%) cases. The American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology definition of biochemical failure (bF) was used; 316 cases (34%) had failed biochemically, and 620 (66%) had not. The end point was overall survival (OS). Time to death was determined from the time of definitive radiotherapy. The median PSA follow-up was 58 months. The median follow-up times for bF vs. no-bF cases were 77 and 49 months, respectively. A multivariate analysis of factors affecting OS using the proportional hazards model was performed for all cases using the following variables: age (>65 vs. < or =65 years), race (African-American vs. Caucasian), clinical T stage (T1-2A vs. T2B-C vs. T3), bGS (< or =6 vs. 7 vs. > or =8), iPSA (continuous variable), use of AD (yes vs. no), year of therapy (continuous variable), radiation dose (continuous variable), radiation technique (conformal vs. standard), and biochemical failure (yes vs. no). RESULTS: The 5-year OS rate for the entire group was 89% (95% CI [confidence interval]: 86-91%). The 5-year OS rates for bF vs. no-bF patients were 89% (95% CI: 86-93%) and 89% (95% CI: 86-92%), respectively. The 10-year OS rate for the entire group was 68% (95% CI: 61-75%). The 10-year OS rates for bF vs. no-bF patients were 65% (95% CI: 56-74%) and 77% (95% CI: 69-84%), respectively. The difference between bF and no bF was not significant in predicting overall survival in univariate analysis (log-rank test, p = 0.68). On multivariate analysis, bGS (p < 0.001), T stage (p = 0.003), radiation dose (p = 0.017), year of therapy (p = 0.031), and age (p = 0.020) were independent predictors of death. iPSA levels (p = 0.33), race (p = 0.80), radiation technique (p = 0.16), and use of AD (p = 0.09) were not predictive of OS. Biochemical failure (p = 0.052) showed only a trend for independently predicting overall survival on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Biochemical failure after definitive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer is not associated with increased mortality within the first 10 years after initial therapy, although a trend toward worse outcome was observed at 10 years. Longer follow-up from initial therapy is needed to fully understand the impact of biochemical failure on overall survival. With longer follow-up, significant differences might be observed at 15 or 20 years after therapy.", "PURPOSE: To study the radiation dose-response as determined by Kaplan-Meier prostate-specific antigen (PSA) disease-free survival (PSA-DFS) estimates in patients with stage T1-T2 prostate cancer treated within a 2-year period (1994-1995). METHODS: Nine institutions combined data on 4839 patients with stage T1 and T2 adenocarcinoma of the prostate who received > or =60 Gy external beam radiation therapy (RT) as sole treatment. No patient received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation or planned adjuvant androgen deprivation. Of the 4839 patients, 1325 were treated in 1994 and 1995; 1061 were treated with <72 Gy and 264 with > or =72 Gy. The median RT doses for the <72 Gy and the > or =72 Gy groups were 68.4 Gy and 75.6 Gy, respectively. The median follow-up for the <72 Gy and the > or =72 Gy groups were 5.8 and 5.7 years, respectively. Risk groups, defined on the basis of T stage, pretherapy PSA level, and biopsy Gleason score (GS), were as follows: low risk--T1b, T1c, T2a, GS < or =6 and PSA < or =10 ng/mL; intermediate risk--T1b, T1c, T2a, GS < or =6 and PSA >10 ng/mL but < or =20 ng/mL or T2b, GS < or =6 and PSA < or =20 ng/mL or GS 7 and PSA < or =20 ng/mL; high risk--GS 8-10 or PSA >20 ng/mL. The endpoint for outcome analysis was PSA-DFS at 5 years after therapy using the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology failure definition. RESULTS: Patients receiving > or =72 Gy had significantly more advanced cancers. The proportion of stage T2b/T2c cancers in the > or =72 Gy group was 42% compared with 32% in the <72 Gy group (p = 0.027). The mean pretherapy PSA was 11.4 ng/mL in the > or =72 Gy group compared with 10.7 ng/mL in the <72 Gy group (p = 0.001). The proportion of GS > or =8 cancers in the > or =72 Gy group was 9% compared with 7% in the <72 Gy group (p = 0.309). Overall, 15% of patients receiving <72 Gy had high-risk disease, compared with 22% of patients receiving > or =72 Gy (p = 0.034). The > or =72 Gy group had a greater number of follow-up PSA levels (mean 10.6/patient) compared with the <72 Gy group (mean 9.6/patient) (p = 0.007). For all 1325 patients, the 5- and 8-year PSA-DFS estimates were 64% and 62%, respectively. The 5-year PSA-DFS estimates for <72 Gy vs. > or =72 Gy were 63% vs. 69%, respectively (p = 0.046). Multivariate analysis for factors affecting PSA-DFS was performed for all cases using the following variables: pretherapy PSA (continuous), biopsy GS (continuous), stage (T1 vs. T2), radiation dose (continuous), and radiation technique (three-dimensional conformal vs. conventional). Pretreatment PSA (p < 0.001, chi-square 112.2), GS (p < 0.001, chi-square 12.8), radiation dose (p < 0.001, chi-square 13.5), and stage (p = 0.007, chi-square 7.2) were independent predictors of outcome. Radiotherapy technique was not (p = 0.50). CONCLUSION: Differences in PSA-DFS estimates observed in multiple retrospective series have been attributed to differences in follow-up duration between patients treated to conventional doses (longer follow-up intervals) and those treated to higher doses (shorter follow-up intervals). In this report, the median follow-up duration in the > or =72 Gy group was essentially identical to the <72 Gy group, because the study included a large number of patients treated consecutively during a narrow time range (1994-1995). With similar follow-up duration, higher than conventional radiotherapy doses were associated with improved PSA-DFS when controlled for the influence of pretreatment PSA levels, biopsy GS, and clinical T stage.", "The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between cancer-related fatigue and clinical parameters, and the effect factors of fatigue for the prostate cancer patients. Long-term follow-up is performed using the Fatigue Symptom Inventory before treatment (A), at the end of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (B), and 3 months (C), 12 months (D), 24 months (E), 36 months (F), and 48 months (G) after the end of intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Three dimensions of fatigue are assessed during follow-up: severity, perceived interference with quality of life, and duration in the past week. In all, 97 patients with locally advanced prostate cancer were enrolled in the study. Median follow-up time was 43.9 months. The fatigue index was significantly higher in the prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/mL, Gleason score >8, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scores, and the higher education. The most severe fatigue occurred at time points B and C. The score for duration of fatigue fluctuated across the time points, with significantly increased scores at time points D, E, and F.In conclusion, we show that cancer-related fatigue is the important symptom which affects the quality of life for the prostate cancer patients. For patients with locally advanced prostate cancer with a high Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, a Gleason score of >8 points, prostate-specific antigen levels of >20 ng/mL, and high education, attention should be paid to the interference of fatigue with quality of life, especially general level of activity, ability to concentrate, and mood, after radiotherapy combined with hormonal therapy."]}
{"question": "Is the urinary biomarkers assessment a non-invasive approach to tubular lesions of the solitary kidney?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: The solitary kidney (SK) is currently debated in the literature, as living kidney donation is extensively used and the diagnosis of congenital SK is frequent. Tubulointerstitial lesions associated with adaptive phenomena may occur early within the SK. AIMS: Analysis of the significance of urinary biomarkers in the assessment of tubulointerstitial lesions of the SK. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 37 patients with SK included 18 patients-acquired SK (mean age 56.44 +/- 12.20 years, interval from nephrectomy 10.94 +/- 9.37 years), 19 patients-congenital SK (mean age 41.52 +/- 10.54 years). Urinary NAG, urinary alpha-1-microglobulin, albuminuria, eGFR (CKD-EPI equation) were measured. RESULTS: In acquired SK, NAG increased in 60.66%, urinary alpha 1-microglobulin in 16.66%, albuminuria in 55.55% of patients. Inverse correlation with eGFR presented NAG (R(2 )= 0.537, p = 0.022), urinary alpha 1-microglobulin (R(2 )= 0.702, p = 0.001), albuminuria (R(2 )= 0.655, p = 0.003). In congenital SK, NAG increased in 52.63%, urinary alpha 1-microglobulin in 5.26%, albuminuria in 47.36% of patients. In this group, urinary biomarkers correlated inversely with eGFR: NAG (R(2 )= 0.743, p < 0.001), urinary alpha 1-microglobulin (R(2 )= 0.701, p = 0.001), albuminuria (R(2 )= 0.821, p < 0.001). Significant correlations were found between the urinary biomarkers in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary biomarkers allow a non-invasive, sensitive, early assessment of the tubular lesions of the SK. Urinary biomarkers of PT injury parallel renal function decline, thus complementing the estimation of GFR. Monitoring of PT dysfunction is mandatory in patients with SK."]}
{"question": "Is there a role for fondaparinux in perioperative bridging?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Interventional pain management involves diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain. This specialty utilizes minimally invasive procedures to target therapeutics to the central nervous system and the spinal column. A subset of patients encountered in interventional pain are medicated using anticoagulant or antithrombotic drugs to mitigate thrombosis risk. Since these drugs target the clotting system, bleeding risk is a consideration accompanying interventional procedures. Importantly, discontinuation of anticoagulant or antithrombotic drugs exposes underlying thrombosis risk, which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality especially in those with coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease. This review summarizes the literature and provides guidelines based on best evidence for patients receiving anti-clotting therapy during interventional pain procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Best evidence synthesis. OBJECTIVE: To provide a current and concise appraisal of the literature regarding an assessment of the bleeding risk during interventional techniques for patients taking anticoagulant and/or antithrombotic medications. METHODS: A review of the available literature published on bleeding risk during interventional pain procedures, practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy was conducted. Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of EMBASE and PubMed from 1966 through August 2018 and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles. RESULTS: 1. There is good evidence for risk stratification by categorizing multiple interventional techniques into low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk. Also, their risk should be upgraded based on other risk factors.2. There is good evidence for the risk of thromboembolic events in patients who interrupt antithrombotic therapy. 3. There is good evidence supporting discontinuation of low dose aspirin for high risk and moderate risk procedures for at least 3 days, and there is moderate evidence that these may be continued for low risk or some intermediate risk procedures.4. There is good evidence that discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy with warfarin, heparin, dabigatran (Pradaxa(R)), argatroban (Acova(R)), bivalirudin (Angiomax(R)), lepirudin (Refludan(R)), desirudin (Iprivask(R)), hirudin, apixaban (Eliquis(R)), rivaroxaban (Xarelto(R)), edoxaban (Savaysa(R), Lixiana(R)), Betrixaban(Bevyxxa(R)), fondaparinux (Arixtra(R)) prior to interventional techniques with individual consideration of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs and individual risk factors increases safety.5. There is good evidence that diagnosis of epidural hematoma is based on severe pain at the site of the injection, rapid neurological deterioration, and MRI with surgical decompression with progressive neurological dysfunction to avoid neurological sequelae.6. There is good evidence that if thromboembolic risk is high, low molecular weight heparin bridge therapy can be instituted during cessation of the anticoagulant, and the low molecular weight heparin can be discontinued 24 hours before the pain procedure.7. There is fair evidence that the risk of thromboembolic events is higher than that of epidural hematoma formation with the interruption of antiplatelet therapy preceding interventional techniques, though both risks are significant.8. There is fair evidence that multiple variables including anatomic pathology with spinal stenosis and ankylosing spondylitis; high risk procedures and moderate risk procedures combined with anatomic risk factors; bleeding observed during the procedure, and multiple attempts during the procedures increase the risk for bleeding complications and epidural hematoma.9. There is fair evidence that discontinuation of phosphodiesterase inhibitors is optional (dipyridamole [Persantine], cilostazol [Pletal]. However, there is also fair evidence to discontinue Aggrenox [dipyridamole plus aspirin]) 3 days prior to undergoing interventional techniques of moderate and high risk. 10. There is fair evidence to make shared decision making between the patient and the treating physicians with the treating physician and to consider all the appropriate risks associated with continuation or discontinuation of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy.11. There is fair evidence that if thromboembolic risk is high antithrombotic therapy may be resumed 12 hours after the interventional procedure is performed.12. There is limited evidence that discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel [Plavix(R)], ticlopidine [Ticlid(R)], Ticagrelor [Brilinta(R)] and prasugrel [Effient(R)]) avoids complications of significant bleeding and epidural hematomas.13. There is very limited evidence supporting the continuation or discontinuation of most NSAIDs, excluding aspirin, for 1 to 2 days and some 4 to 10 days, since these are utilized for pain management without cardiac or cerebral protective effect. LIMITATIONS: The continued paucity of the literature with discordant recommendations. CONCLUSION: Based on the survey of current literature, and published clinical guidelines, recommendations for patients presenting with ongoing antithrombotic therapy prior to interventional techniques are variable, and are based on comprehensive analysis of each patient and the risk-benefit analysis of intervention. KEY WORDS: Perioperative bleeding, bleeding risk, practice patterns, anticoagulant therapy, antithrombotic therapy, interventional techniques, safety precautions, pain."]}
{"question": "Adjuvant radiation of stage III thymoma: is it necessary?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The criteria for administration of adjuvant radiation therapy after thymoma resection remains controversial, and it is unclear whether patients with Masaoka stage III thymoma benefit from adjuvant radiation. The goal of this report was to determine whether or not this group benefits from radiation therapy in disease-specific survival and disease-free survival. METHODS: Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed from 1972 to 2004. One hundred and seventy-nine patients underwent resection for thymoma, of which 45 had stage III disease. RESULTS: Forty-five stage III patients underwent resection and in 36 it was complete. Thirty-eight stage III patients received radiation therapy. Baseline prognostic factors between radiated and nonradiated groups were similar. The addition of adjuvant radiotherapy did not alter local or distant recurrence rates in patients with stage III thymoma. Disease-specific survival at 10 years in stage III patients who did not receive radiation was 75% (95% confidence interval, 32% to 100%) and in patients who did receive radiation therapy it was 79% (95% confidence interval, 64% to 94%) (p = 0.21). The most common site of relapse was the pleura. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients who have stage III thymoma undergo complete resection. Some patients enjoy prolonged disease-free survival without adjuvant radiation after resection of stage III thymoma. Radiation does not seem to prevent pleural recurrences when given after resection of stage III thymomas. The use of routine adjuvant radiation after a complete resection of stage III thymoma needs to be re-addressed. There may be a role for the use of chemotherapy to reduce pleural recurrences.", "Thirty-six patients with pathologically confirmed thymoma were treated at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1962 to 1987. The tumors were staged based on invasion and intrathoracic dissemination. Twenty-one patients had total resection, five had subtotal resection, and 10 had biopsy alone. Twenty-two patients had definitive megavoltage radiation therapy with a median dose of 50 Gy. The 5-year, disease-free survival by stage was 74% for Stage I (n = 11), 71% for Stage II (n = 8), 50% for Stage III (n = 10), and 29% for Stage IVA (n = 7) (p less than 0.03). The 5-year, disease-free survival by extent of surgery was 74% for total resection, 60% for subtotal resection and 20% for biopsy only (p = 0.001). There were 15 patients with recurrences: two in Stage I, two in Stage II, five in Stage III, and six in Stage IVA. The median months to relapse, for those who failed treatment, were 46, 36, 2, and 13 for Stages I, II, III, and IVA respectively. Of the patients with recurrences four had a total resection, two subtotal resection, and nine biopsy only. Only one patient had distant metastases as the first site of relapse without intrathoracic relapse. For the eight patients who relapsed following radiation therapy, four were in the radiotherapy field. All four of the in-field failures were in patients who had a partial response. There were insufficient numbers of patients to determine a dose response to radiotherapy. For patients with invasive, incompletely resected disease, a multimodality approach may be necessary for long term, disease-free survival."]}
{"question": "The colour of pain: can patients use colour to describe osteoarthritis pain?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to explore patients' views on the acceptability and feasibility of using colour to describe osteoarthritis (OA) pain, and whether colour could be used to communicate pain to healthcare professionals. METHODS: Six group interviews were conducted with 17 patients with knee OA. Discussion topics included first impressions about using colour to describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with colour, how colours related to changes to intensity and different pain qualities, and whether they could envisage using colour to describe pain to healthcare professionals. RESULTS: The group interviews indicated that, although the idea of using colour was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours. The majority of participants thought that they would be able to use colour to describe their pain to healthcare professionals, although issues around the interpretability and standardization of colour were raised. CONCLUSIONS: For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal diseases, affecting patients suffering from pain and physical limitations. Recent evidence indicates a potential inflammatory component of the disease, with both T-cells and monocytes/macrophages potentially associated with the pathogenesis of OA. Further studies postulated an important role for subsets of both inflammatory cell lineages, such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and T-regulatory lymphocytes, and M1, M2, and synovium-tissue-resident macrophages. However, the interaction between the local synovial and systemic inflammatory cellular response and the structural changes in the joint is unknown. To fully understand how T-cells and monocytes/macrophages contribute towards OA, it is important to be able to quantitively identify these cells and their subsets simultaneously in synovial tissue, secondary lymphatic organs and systemically (the spleen and bone marrow). Nowadays, the different inflammatory cell subsets can be identified by a combination of cell-surface markers making multi-color flow cytometry a powerful technique in investigating these cellular processes. In this protocol, we describe detailed steps regarding the harvest of synovial tissue and secondary lymphatic organs as well as generation of single cell suspensions. Furthermore, we present both an extracellular staining assay to identify monocytes/macrophages and their subsets as well as an extra- and intra-cellular staining assay to identify T-cells and their subsets within the murine spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes and synovial tissue. Each step of this protocol was optimized and tested, resulting in a highly reproducible assay that can be utilized for other surgical and non-surgical OA mouse models.", "Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a condition in which subtle deformities of the femoral head and acetabulum (hip socket) result in pathological abutment during hip motion. FAI is a common cause of hip pain and can lead to acetabular cartilage damage and osteoarthritis. For some patients with FAI, surgical intervention is indicated, and it can improve quality of life and potentially delay the onset of osteoarthritis. For other patients, however, surgery is contraindicated because significant cartilage damage has already occurred. Unfortunately, current imaging modalities (X-rays and conventional MRI) are subjective and lack the sensitivity to distinguish these two groups reliably. In this paper, we describe the pairing of T2* mapping data (an investigational, objective MRI sequence) and a spatial proportional odds model for surgically obtained ordinal outcomes (Beck's scale of cartilage damage). Each hip in the study is assigned its own spatial dependence parameter, and a Dirichlet process prior distribution permits clustering of said parameters. Using the fitted model, we produce a six-color, patient-specific predictive map of the entire acetabular cartilage. Such maps will facilitate patient education and clinical decision making.

{"question": "Is the type of remission after a major depressive episode an important risk factor to relapses in a 4-year follow up?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Rates of relapse and predictive relapse factors were studied over more than 4 years in a sample of Spanish outpatients with DSM-III-R criteria for unipolar major depressive episode. METHODS: A final sample of 139 outpatient was followed monthly in a naturalistic study. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R was used. Phases of evolution were recorded using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, applying the Frank criteria. Survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier product limit and proportional hazards models were used. RESULTS: A higher rate of relapses was observed in the partial remission group (91.4%) compared to the complete remission one (51.3%). The four factors with predictive relapse value were: \"partial remission versus complete remission\", \"the intensity of clinical symptoms\", \"the age\" and \"the number of previous depressive episodes\". The existence of partial remission was the most powerful predictive factor. LIMITATIONS: The decreasing sample size during the follow-up and the difficulty in warranting the treatment compliance. CONCLUSIONS: At medium term, relapse rates for a major depressive episode are high. Partial remission after a depressive episode seems to be an important predictive factor for relapses in a 4-year follow-up. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Not reaching complete remission is a strong risk factor for relapses in a 4-year follow up study.", "BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the course of illness among severely depressed patients ascertained at first hospitalization. Using data from the Suffolk County Mental Health Project (SCMHP), we investigated the times to and predictors of the first full remission and the first relapse during a 4-year period in a first-admission cohort with major depressive disorder (MDD) with psychotic features. METHOD: The cohort included 87 county-wide, first-admission patients with a longitudinal consensus diagnosis of MDD with psychotic features who were systematically followed over a 4-year period. We examined the associations of background, clinical and treatment factors, and time-varying indices of antidepressant (AD) and antipsychotic (AP) medication use to time to remission and relapse using Cox regression. RESULTS: By the 4-year follow-up, 60 respondents (69.0%) had achieved a period of full remission (median time of 22 weeks among remitters and 54 weeks in the full sample). In the multivariable analysis, longer time to remission was associated with longer latency between initial episode and hospitalization, lower pre-hospital Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score, and lack of insurance, but not use of medication. Twenty-six remitters (43.3%) relapsed (median time of 50 weeks among those who relapsed and 192 weeks among all remitters). None of the risk factors or time-varying medication variables was significantly associated with time to relapse. CONCLUSION: Only two-thirds of the sample had at least one full remission by 4 years, and almost half of them subsequently relapsed. Poorer pre-hospital resources predicted remission but not relapse. Medication use over the follow-up was not associated with remission or relapse."]}
{"question": "Do elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared with younger ones?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The increasingly older population confronts oncologists with an imposing challenge: older cancer patients have specific healthcare needs both independent of and associated with the diagnosis of cancer. The aim of the present study is to examine whether elderly versus younger cancer patients have different needs with respect to attendance, treatment and information. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational and cross-sectional study. Cancer patients aged 35 to 82 years were consecutively interviewed. The group was divided into two subgroups aged </=65 and >/=66 years old. The Needs Evaluation Questionnaire (NEQ) was used to assess patients' needs and demographic variables were collected. Data analysis was carried out by means of cross-tabulation analyses and the chi-square test. RESULTS: The requests most frequently expressed by the older group concerned financial-insurance information (73.9%), the need to talk to people with the same illness (71.7%), the need to receive more comprehensible information from doctors and nurses (71.7%), and the need for a better dialogue with clinicians (69.6%). Few significant differences between the two age subgroups were found, with the exception of issues such as the need for intimacy and support. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "BACKGROUND: Colon cancer is common, affecting mostly older people. Since age is a risk factor, young patients might not be given the same attention as older ones regarding symptoms that could imply the presence of colon cancer. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether young patients, i.e., under age 50, complain of symptoms for longer than older patients until the diagnosis of colon cancer is established. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients were divided into two groups: < 50 years old (group 1) and > or = 50 (group 2). All had undergone surgery for left or right-colon cancer during the 10 year period of the study from January 2000 through December 2009 at one medical center. Rectal and sigmoid cancers were excluded. Data collected included age, geander, quantity and quality of complaints, duration of complaints, in-hospital versus community diagnosis, pathological staging, the side of colon involved, and overall mortality. The primary outcome was the quality and duration of complaints. Secondary outcomes were the pathological stage at presentation and the mortality rate. RESULTS: The study group comprised 236 patients: 31 (13.1%) were < 50 years old and 205 (86.9%) were > or = 50. No significant difference was found in the quantity and quality of complaints between the two groups. Patients in group 1 (< 50 years) complained for a longer period, 5.3 vs.2.4 months (P= 0.002). More younger patients were diagnosed with stage IV disease (38.7% vs. 21.5%, P= 0.035) and fewer had stage I disease (3.2% vs. 15.6%, P= 0.06); the mortality rates were similar (41.9% vs. 39%). Applying a stepwise logistic regression model, the duration of complaints was found to be a predictor of mortality (P= 0.03, OR 1.6, 95% CI 1-3.6), independently of age (P= 0.003) and stage (P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients are more often diagnosed with colon cancer later, at a more advanced stage. Alertness to patients' complaints, together with evaluation regardless of age but according to symptoms and clinical presentation are crucial. Large-scale population-based studies are needed to confirm this trend.", "Few economic evaluations are currently available on multiple myeloma (MM) and they address treatment-related rather than disease-related costs. We estimated resource utilisation and costs associated with MM in an Italian haematology department. This was a single-centre observational study which followed retrospectively for 2 years 90 patients with MM stages II-III. To investigate the association between costs and age as a prognostic factor for treatment eligibility, patients were classified in two age groups (under 65 or >65). The annual average cost per patient was very similar in the two subgroups. Drugs and hospitalisations were the largest cost components. Differences between the two age groups were significant only for drugs, hospital admissions and day hospital (DH) days. Autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) accounted for more than 80% of the non-pharmacological therapy costs, being nearly double in the younger patients. Cost of elderly patients is comparable with that of younger ones who generally receive expensive procedures such as ASCT. The higher hospital costs of younger patients were counterbalanced by supportive pharmaceutical care and DH days for older patients, mainly in the group treated with new immunomodulatory agents. Further multi-centre studies on larger samples of patients are needed."]}
{"question": "Is breast cancer survival improving?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Despite advances in therapies for breast cancer, improvement in survival for patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer has been difficult to establish. The objective of the current study was to determine whether the survival of women with recurrent breast cancer has improved from 1974 to 2000. METHODS: The authors analyzed the survival experience of 834 women who developed recurrent breast cancer between November 1974 and December 2000. All patients had been treated previously with adjuvant anthracycline-based protocols. Patients were divided into five consecutive groups based on year of breast cancer recurrence, and survival was compared across the five groups. Because some prognostic variables were divided unevenly divided among the cohorts, a multivariate model was created to determine the association of year of recurrence and survival after accounting for other prognostic factors. RESULTS: In the unadjusted analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival across the five groups, and the more recent cohorts had longer survival (P < 0.001). Other variables that predicted longer survival after breast cancer recurrence included smaller initial tumor size, lower stage of disease, fewer lymph nodes involved, longer disease-free interval, estrogen receptor-positive tumors, and nonvisceral dominant site of disease recurrence. In the multivariate analysis, which adjusted for these prognostic factors, year of recurrence was associated with a trend toward improved survival, with a 1% reduction in risk for each increasing year. CONCLUSIONS: For these cohorts of patients, the authors present data suggesting that the prognosis for patients with recurrent breast cancer improved between 1974 and 2000.", "BACKGROUND: Advances in the early detection and treatment of breast cancer during the past 20 years should have been associated with increased survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined outcomes for patients with invasive breast cancer diagnosed before and after opening a hospital-affiliated comprehensive community cancer center and compared rates of improvement in survival with national benchmarks. Survival data for patients with invasive cancer were obtained from the Hoag Hospital tumor registry. National Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) survival data for all eras reported for 1981-2001 were used for extramural comparisons. RESULTS: Observed 5-year survival improved from 79% to 84% (P=0.003) for patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer during 1986-1991 compared with 1992-1999, the eras immediately before and after opening Hoag Cancer Center. During 1981-1993, relative 5-year survival rates increased slowly, nationally and locally, with both at 86% for 1986-1993. Since then, Hoag relative 5-year survival rates have steadily increased to 97% compared with 88% for SEER during 1995-2001. Improved survival for Hoag patients was observed for all general stages of disease and associated with increased use of systemic treatment and radiation therapy in addition to surgery. CONCLUSION: The existence of Hoag Cancer Center has been associated with improved survival for patients with invasive breast cancer and for all stages of disease. The rate of improvement has been more rapid than observed nationally. Systematic dissemination of new information might have resulted in earlier adoption of improved screening and diagnostic and multidisciplinary treatment approaches that led to higher survival rates.", "Breast cancer is now the most common cancer of women in the UK and incidence is increasing. Because of major treatment advances and earlier diagnosis over the past 40 years, survival rates have been improving gradually and women diagnosed with breast cancer today are almost twice as likely to survive for 10 years or longer as women 40 years ago. However, breast cancer remains a major contributor to cancer morbidity and mortality in the UK. The majority of patients present with potentially curative disease and surgery is the mainstay of treatment. Many patients receive adjuvant (post-operative) therapy, which reduces the risk of loco-regional and distant disease recurrence. Treatment options include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and biological agents, with treatment increasingly tailored to the individual tumour and patient, aiming to provide maximum survival benefit with minimum toxicity. Many patients participate in clinical trials of radiotherapy, new agents, drug combinations or novel dosing regimens. Patients with metastatic disease can rarely be offered curative treatment, but improved quality of life and prolonged survival may be achieved with palliative treatment, including hormones, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, trastuzumab and bisphosphonates. This overview aims to summarise current knowledge and recent developments in the management of breast cancer.", "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women and ranks second among causes for cancer related death in women. The ability to identify and diagnose breast cancer has improved markedly. Treatment decisions which were based in the past predominantly on the anatomic extent of the disease are shifting to the underlying biological mechanisms. Gene array technology has led to the recognition that breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease composed of different biological subtypes, and genetic profiling enables response to chemotherapy to be predicted. Breast conservation became an established standard of care and the oncoplastic approach enables wide excisions without compromising the natural shape of the breast. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has replaced axillary dissection as the standard procedure to stage the axilla and spared many patients the excess morbidity of axillary dissection. Targeted therapy to the oestrogen receptor plays a major role in systemic therapy; pathways responsible for endocrine resistance have been targeted as well. Biological therapy has been developed to target HER2 receptor and combination of antibody drug conjugates linked cytotoxic therapy to HER2 antibodies. Meaningful improvements in survival resulted from the new effective systemic agents and patients with metastasis are likely to have a longer survival.", "PURPOSE: In the last 25 years new treatment options in breast cancer have evolved. We wanted to determine whether the survival of; patients with metastatic breast cancer have improved during this period. METHODS: Patients consecutively diagnosed with disseminated breast cancer 1985-2014 in the County of Kalmar, Sweden, were identified and followed to 2016. Survival was calculated for each successive 5 year interval. Separate analyses were performed for pts with ER and/or PR and HER2 positive tumours resp. RESULTS: Median survival of the 784 patients increased successively from 13 to 33 months. Five year survival increased from 10 to 27%. Patients with high grade primary tumours had the shortest post recurrence survival time but their median survival increased significantly by time from 12 to 30 months, 3 year survival from 16 to 38% and 5 year from 5 to 20%. Median survival for patients with grade 2 tumours was 2 years and did not improve. Only 47 patients had grade 1 tumours and their median survival of 4 years did not change. Median survival for HER2 positive patients treated before the introduction of trastuzumab in year 2000 was 14 months and after 2000 29 months, 5 year survival improved from 2 to 31%. CONCLUSIONS: Survival in metastatic breast cancer improved 1985-2016. For the first time a significant increase in survival time for patients with metastasis from fast-growing grade 3 tumours was seen. The most striking improvement was achieved in the HER2 positive subset."]}
{"question": "Fast foods - are they a risk factor for asthma?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Lifestyle changes over the last 30 years are the most likely explanation for the increase in allergic disease over this period. AIM: This study tests the hypothesis that the consumption of fast food is related to the prevalence of asthma and allergy. METHODS: As part of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) a cross-sectional prevalence study of 1321 children (mean age = 11.4 years, range: 10.1-12.5) was conducted in Hastings, New Zealand. Using standard questions we collected data on the prevalence of asthma and asthma symptoms, as well as food frequency data. Skin prick tests were performed to common environmental allergens and exercise-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was assessed according to a standard protocol. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height2 (kg/m2) and classified into overweight and obese according to a standard international definition. RESULTS: After adjusting for lifestyle factors, including other diet and BMI variables, compared with children who never ate hamburgers, we found an independent risk of hamburger consumption on having a history of wheeze [consumption less than once a week (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06-1.96) and 1+ times a week (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.07-2.52)] and on current wheeze [consumption less than once a week (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.80-1.70) and 1+ times a week (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.10-2.98)]. Takeaway consumption 1+ times a week was marginally significantly related to BHR (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 0.99-5.91). There was no effect on atopy. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent consumption of hamburgers showed a dose-dependent association with asthma symptoms, and frequent takeaway consumption showed a similar association with BHR.", "The prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases have been on the rise, especially in developing countries due to life-style changes. The study aimed to investigate the association between the frequency of fast food consumption with wheeze and asthma among adolescents. A previously validated self-completed questionnaire from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood was used to collect information on demographics, socioeconomic status, house characteristics, adolescent respiratory health and diet. The prevalence of wheeze was 38.2% and of asthma was 16.37% among the adolescents. The results from the adjusted regression analyses indicated that eating fast foods three or more times per week was a statistically significant risk factor for wheeze (OR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.26-2.03) and asthma (OR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.04-1.91). The study found an association between eating fast foods three or more times per week and wheeze and asthma among adolescents in South Africa. Unhealthy diet plays a crucial role in respiratory health among adolescents; healthy eating habits are encouraged to reduce the burden of respiratory symptoms and diseases.", "OBJECTIVE: The relationship between dietary patterns and the prevalence of asthma is not well understood. We aimed to investigate the association between dietary patterns and asthma in adults in Qatar. METHODS: In this study, cross-sectional data from the Qatar Biobank were used (n = 986). Participants were Qatari or long-term Qatar residents aged >/=20 years old. A food frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary intakes. Three dietary patterns were identified using factor analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between dietary patterns scores and asthma. RESULTS: Among 986 eligible participants, 6.6% (n = 65) reported that they were diagnosed with asthma. Three dietary patterns were identified. These were (1) \"Traditional\" (high intake of rice, chicken/meat/fish, and breads); (2) \"Prudent\" (high intake of fruits, vegetables, and fish); and (3) \"Fast Food/Sweets\" (high intake of desserts, fast food, and soft drinks). The fast food/sweet dietary pattern was associated with increased likelihood of having asthma [comparing high vs. low tertile, OR for asthma = 1.25; 95% CI (1.02-1.54); p = 0.035]. Traditional and Prudent dietary patterns were not associated with the prevalence of asthma. CONCLUSION: The fast food/sweet dietary pattern was directly associated with the prevalence of asthma among adults in Qatar. Reducing the fast foods and sugary-rich foods may be beneficial for respiratory health.", "Childhood asthma has rapidly increased over the past few decades, possibly due to changes in lifestyle and dietary patterns. We aimed to determine associations between dietary patterns and asthma in schoolchildren in Taiwan. The Nutrition and Health survey in Taiwan Elementary School Children was carried out by using a multi-staged complex sampling design. A total of 2,082 elementary school children with complete data on dietary, lifestyle, demographics and asthma were included in the analysis. We used a Chinese version of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire to generate an asthma symptom score and to define asthma outcomes. Dietary intake was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. Reduced rank regression (RRR) was used to identify the dietary pattern associated with the asthma symptoms score. Asthma outcomes included; current asthma, current severe asthma, nocturnal cough, exercise-induced wheeze and asthma ever. The RRR-derived dietary pattern was characterized by high consumption of fast foods, high-fat snacks, candy, and cheese; and low consumption of fruit, vegetables and rice. The RRR-derived dietary pattern was associated with an increased risk of current asthma (OR [95% CI]) (2.42 [1.19-4.93] for Q4/Q1, p-for-trend=0.01), current severe asthma (3.21 [1.11-9.25] for Q3/Q1, 4.45 [1.59-12.5] for Q4/Q1; p-for-trend=0.003), and nocturnal cough (1.79 [1.06-3.05] for Q2/Q1, 1.74 [1.02-2.97] for Q3/Q1, 1.82 [1.07-3.11] for Q4/Q1; p-for-trend=0.049). Our results suggest that a diet with a high intake of fat and simple sugars and low intake of fruit, vegetables and rice is associated with an increased risk of asthma in Taiwanese children.", "Several risk factors including environmental exposures, socioeconomic status, and dietary factors including dietary patterns have been considered for childhood Asthma. The present study tried to examine the association between a western-style pattern and the likelihood of asthma and its symptoms in Yazd, Iran. In the present cross-sectional study, dietary intakes of elementary and high-school children were obtained through a validated GAN questionnaire. The GAN questionnaire, derived from the ISAAC questionnaire was used to assess the symptoms of allergic diseases and their related risk factors. A western dietary pattern score considered 9 food groups including chicken eggs, margarine, butter, sugar, fast foods, soft drinks, snacks, sauce, and chocolate. In total 7667 children aged 10.9 +/- 3.35 years were included in the current investigation. Boys with higher adherence to western dietary pattern had a higher risk of wheezing in the past 12 months (OR 1.37, 5% CI 1.01-1.87, P = 0.04) and this association was also observed in the whole population (OR 1.30, 5% CI 1.05-1.60, P = 0.01). However, after adjustment for confounders this relation did not remain significant in boys. Our results support the hypothesis that a western dietary pattern is associated with an increased risk of wheezing in the past 12 months in children with asthma. Future prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding."]}
{"question": "Is the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire useful for the screening of partial androgenic deficiency of aging men?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Androgen serum levels significantly decrease in older men, causing quality of life impairment and increasing the risk of chronic disease. This disorder is defined as PADAM (Partial Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a PADAM screening tool and determine the prevalence of this disorder in healthy adult men. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which 96 men aged 40 or more of the South Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile were surveyed with the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire of the Saint Louis University and sampled for the serum determination of total testosterone, sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Also free and bioavailable testosterone were calculated. PADAM was considered present if items 1 or 7 or any 3 other questions of the ADAM questionnaire were positive. An available testosterone of <198.4 ng/dL was used as a gold standard for the diagnosis of PADAM. RESULTS: A total of 78 men (81.3%) were identified as possible PADAM according to the ADAM questionnaire. Total testosterone levels fell from 503.6+/-180.1 ng/dL in men aged 40 to 54 years to 382.1+/-247.3 in those >70 years; however this was not statistically significant (ANOVA, p=0.06). In the same age groups, SHBG significantly increased (31.0+/-15.0 to 47.5+/-15.0 nmol/L, p<0.001) whereas free and available testosterone significantly decreased (10.6+/-3.2 to 6.4+/-3.6 ng/dL and 266.6+/-81.2 to 152.2+/-97.6 ng/dL, respectively, p<0.0001). Overall (n=96), available testosterone confirmed PADAM diagnosis in 27 cases (28.1%). The ADAM tool rendered a 83.3% sensitivity and 19.7% specificity in the detection of PADAM. Item 1 (decreased sexual desire) was a better predictor of hypogonadism than the complete questionnaire (63.3% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity). CONCLUSION: In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present."]}
{"question": "Does the Transmissible Liability Index (TLI) assessed in late childhood predict suicidal symptoms at young adulthood?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Our previous work demonstrated that the Transmissible Liability Index (TLI), an instrument designed as an index of liability for substance use disorder (SUD), is associated with risk of substance use disorder. This longitudinal study assessed whether TLI measured in 10-12-year-olds (late childhood) predicts suicidal behavior from age 12-14 (preadolescence) to age 25 (young adulthood). We hypothesized that TLI would predict number and severity of suicide attempts. METHODS: Subjects were sons of men who had lifetime history of SUD (n = 250), called the High Average Risk (HAR) group, and sons of men with no lifetime history of a SUD (n = 250), called the Low Average Risk (LAR) group. The TLI was delineated at baseline (age 10-12), and age-specific versions were administered at 12-14, 16, 19, 22, and 25 years of age. RESULTS: TLI was significantly associated with number and severity of lifetime suicide attempts. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the hypothesis that TLI assessed at late childhood is a predictor of frequency and severity of suicidal behavior from preadolescence to young adulthood."]}
{"question": "Are there gender differences in the reasons why African Americans delay in seeking medical help for symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: To identify gender differences in delay time and the reasons why African Americans delay in seeking medical care for symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Five hospitals in the San Francisco and East Bay areas. PATIENTS: Sixty-one African American men and women diagnosed with an AMI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prehospital delay time. RESULTS: Median delay time was longer for women compared to men (4.4 hours vs 3.5 hours), although the difference was not significant. Single women delayed longer than single men (P = .03), and women who were alone when symptoms began delayed longer than women with someone (P = .03). Women who received advice to seek help or call 911 upon symptom onset had shorter delays compared to women who were not advised to call 911 (P = .01). Men at home delayed longer than men who experienced their symptoms outside the home (P = .01). Men with emergency room insurance delayed longer than men without emergency room insurance (P = .03), and men who took an ambulance to the hospital had shorter delay times than men who took other means of transportation (P = .04). CONCLUSION: Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI."]}
{"question": "Are lifetime prevalence of impetigo, molluscum and herpes infection really increased in children having atopic dermatitis?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Cutaneous infections such as impetigo contagiosum (IC), molluscum contagiosum (MC) and herpes virus infection (HI) appear to be associated with atopic dermatitis (AD), but there are no reports of concrete epidemiological evidence. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association of childhood AD with these infections by conducting a population-based cross-sectional study. METHODS: Enrolled in this study were 1117 children aged 0-6 years old attending nursery schools in Ishigaki City, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Physical examination was performed by dermatologists, and a questionnaire was completed on each child's history of allergic diseases including AD, asthma, allergic rhinitis and egg allergy, and that of skin infections including IC, MC and HI, as well as familial history of AD. RESULTS: In 913 children (AD; 132), a history of IC, MC or HI was observed in 45.1%, 19.7%, and 2.5%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of having a history of IC were 1.8 times higher in AD children than in non-AD children. Meanwhile, a history of MC was significantly correlated to the male gender, but not to a personal history of AD. As for HI, we found no correlated factors in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The lifetime prevalence of IC was indeed higher in young children with a history of AD."]}
{"question": "Factors determining the survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with lung metastasis alone: does combined modality treatment benefit?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with lung metastasis alone has been reported as a relatively favorable prognostic group, and combined modality treatment might be indicated for selected cases. However, the prognostic factors determining survival of this group and the indication of combined therapy have not been thoroughly studied. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 246 patients of NPC with lung metastasis(es) alone presented at diagnosis or as the first failure after primary treatment from 1993 to 2008 in an academic tertiary hospital. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses of post-metastasis survival (PMS) and overall survival (OS) were carried out to determine the prognostic factors. RESULTS: The 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year of PMS and OS for the whole cohort were 34.3%, 17.0%, 8.6% and 67.8%, 45.4%, 18.5%, respectively. The median PMS (45.6 months vs. 23.7 months) and OS (73.7 months vs. 46.2 months) of patients treated with combined therapy was significantly longer than that of those treated with chemotherapy alone (P < 0.001). Age, disease-free interval (DFI) and treatment modality were evaluated as independent prognostic factors of OS, while only age and treatment modality retain their independent significance in PMS analysis. In stratified survival analysis, compared to chemotherapy alone, combined therapy could benefit the patients with DFI > 1 year, but not those with DFI </= 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Age </= 45 years, DFI > 1 year, and the combined therapy were good prognostic factors for NPC patients with lung metastasis(es) alone. The combination of local therapy and the basic chemotherapy should be considered for these patients with DFI > 1 year.", "PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify the independent prognostic factors and optimize the treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with distant metastasis at initial diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 234 patients referred between January 2001 and December 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Among the 234 patients, 94 patients received chemotherapy alone (CT), and 140 patients received chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Clinical features, laboratory parameters and treatment modality were examined with univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) time was 22 months (range, 2-125 months), and the 1-year, 2-year, 3-year overall survival rates were 82.2%, 51.3% and 34.1%. The overall response and disease control rates of metastatic lesions after chemotherapy were 56.0% and 89.8%. The factors associated with poor response were karnofsky performance score (KPS) <80, liver metastasis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)>245 IU/L, and number of chemotherapy cycles <4. The 3-year OS of patients receiving CRT was higher than those receiving CT alone (48.2% vs. 12.4%, p<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that significantly improved survival was also achieved by radiotherapy of the primary tumor in patients who achieved complete remission (CR)/partial remission (PR) or stable disease (SD) of metastatic lesions after chemotherapy. Significant independent prognostic factors of OS were KPS, liver metastasis, levels of LDH, and multiple metastases. Treatment modality, response to chemotherapy and chemotherapy cycles were also associated with OS. CONCLUSION: A combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy seems to have survival benefits for selected patients with distant metastases at initial diagnosis. Clinical and laboratory characteristics can help to guide treatment selection. Prospective randomized studies are needed to confirm the result."]}

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 483 patients with BPPV were included in the study group. The control group consisted of 461 healthy subjects. In both groups, serologic analysis of viral agents (HSV1, HSV2, Herpes zoster, EBV, CMV, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus) was performed. RESULTS: With the exception of influenza and parainfluenza, all viral serology values were higher in the BBPV group than the control group. We also observed seasonal variation. The BPPV group exhibited elevated values for HSV1 and adenovirus in March and May, for Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and influenza in April, for HSV1 in June, and for HSV1 and CMV in September, compared to the control group. In October, the BPPV group showed increased values for all of the viruses studied, compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "OBJECTIVE: In this review the authors discuss evidence from the literature concerning vitamin D and temporal bone diseases (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [BPPV], Meniere's disease [MD], vestibular neuritis, idiopathic facial paralysis, idiopathic acute hearing loss). Common features shared by Meniere's disease, glaucoma, and the possible influence by vitamin D are briefly discussed. DATA SOURCES, STUDY SELECTION: Publications from 1970 until recent times have been reviewed according to a keyword search (see above) in PubMed. CONCLUSIONS: MD, BPPV, vestibular neuritis, idiopathic facial paralysis, idiopathic acute hearing loss may all have several etiological factors, but a common feature of the current theories is that an initial viral infection and a subsequent autoimmune/autoinflammatory reaction might be involved. Additionally, in some of these entities varying degrees of demyelination have been documented. Given the immunomodulatory effect of vitamin D, we postulate that it may play a role in suppressing an eventual postviral autoimmune reaction. This beneficial effect may be enhanced by the antioxidative activity of vitamin D and its potential in stabilizing endothelial cells. The association of vitamin D deficiency with demyelination has already been established in other entities such as multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalitis. Mice without vitamin D receptor show degenerative features in inner ear ganglia, hair cells, as well as otoconia. The authors suggest further studies concerning the role of vitamin D deficiency in diseases of the temporal bone. Additionally, the possible presence and degree of demyelination in these entities will have to be elucidated more systematically in the future."]}
{"question": "Is late-night salivary cortisol a better screening test for possible cortisol excess than standard screening tests in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: To compare the performance, in terms of specificity for cortisol excess, of late-night salivary cortisol with 24-hour urine-free cortisol (24hr UFC) and overnight 1mg dexamethasone suppression test (1mg DST) in a group of obese T2DM patients. METHODS: Forty obese patients with T2DM without clinical features of Cushing's syndrome were recruited. Plasma, urinary and salivary cortisol were measured directly by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal antibodies. The specificities of the three tests using various cutoffs were calculated and compared, employing the assumption that none of the patients had hypercortisolism. RESULTS: The patients had a mean age and BMI of 56 years (range 31-75) and 37 kg/m(2) (31-56) respectively. All 40 provided late-night salivary cortisol samples. Thirty-eight patients completed all three tests. Two patients only completed two screening tests. The specificities of late-night salivary cortisol (cutoff 10 nmol/L), 24hr UFC (400 nmol) and 1mg DST (50 nmol/L) were 70% (95% CI 53-83%), 90% (76-97%) and 72% (55-85%) respectively. The specificity of late-night salivary cortisol was significantly less than 24 hr UFC (P=0.039) but not 1mg DST (P>0.99). CONCLUSION: Late-night salivary cortisol has a poor specificity for cortisol excess in obese patients with T2DM with 24 hr UFC showing significantly better specificity in our population."]}
{"question": "Does continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bolus intravenous injection of epinephrine can decrease uterine blood flow. This study examined the effects of intravenous infusion of epinephrine on uterine blood flow in the gravid ewe. METHODS: Maternal and fetal vascular catheters and a maternal electromagnetic uterine artery flow probe were implanted in 10 near-term gravid ewes. After recovery, saline, 0.125% bupivacaine, 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine, and 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:800,000 epinephrine were infused into the maternal superior vena cava. Drugs were infused at 10 mL/h for 30 minutes and then at 20 mL/h for an additional 30 minutes. Animals also received an intravenous bolus of epinephrine 15 micrograms. Throughout all infusions, maternal heart rate, systemic and pulmonary blood pressures, uterine blood flow, cardiac output, and acid-base balance were measured, as well as fetal heart rate, blood pressure, and acid-base balance. RESULTS: Epinephrine 15 micrograms decreased uterine blood flow to 68 +/- 14% of baseline (mean +/- SD). Infusion of all solutions had no effect on any measured hemodynamic variable. CONCLUSIONS: In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of < or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion."]}
{"question": "Should all human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with end-stage renal disease be excluded from transplantation?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients have generally been excluded from transplantation. Recent advances in the management and prognosis of these patients suggest that this policy should be reevaluated. METHODS: To explore the current views of U.S. transplant centers toward transplanting asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, a written survey was mailed to the directors of transplantation at all 248 renal transplant centers in the United States. RESULTS: All 148 responding centers said they require HIV testing of prospective kidney recipients, and 84% of these centers would not transplant an individual who refuses HIV testing. The vast majority of responding centers would not transplant a kidney from a cadaveric (88%) or a living donor (91%) into an asymptomatic HIV-infected patient who is otherwise a good candidate for transplantation. Among the few centers that would consider transplanting an HIV-infected patient, not a single center had performed such a transplant in the year prior to the survey. Most centers fear that transplantation in the face of HIV infection would be harmful to the individual, and some believe that it would be a waste of precious organs. CONCLUSIONS: The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients have historically been excluded from consideration for transplantation out of concern for the effects of immunosuppression on the progression of HIV disease. Improvements in HIV-related morbidity and mortality with the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have prompted a reevaluation of transplantation as a treatment option for HIV-infected patients with end-stage kidney and liver disease. METHODS: Eligible patients met standard transplant criteria. They had undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (viral load) for 3 months (kidney) or were predicted to achieve viral load suppression posttransplantation if unable to tolerate HAART (liver); a CD4+ T-cell count of more than 200 cells/microL (kidney) or more than 100 cells/microL (liver) for 6 months; and no history of opportunistic infections and neoplasm. Standard immunosuppression included prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), and cyclosporine (Neoral, Novartis, East Hanover, NJ). RESULTS: Fourteen patients received transplants (10 kidney transplants, mean follow-up 480 days; four liver transplants, mean follow-up 380 days). All of the kidney transplant recipients (100%) are alive and with functioning grafts, and three of four liver transplant patients (75%) are alive and well with functioning grafts (all liver transplant patients with normal liver function tests). The one death occurred 445 days posttransplantation in a liver recipient coinfected with hepatitis C virus, who died as the result of its rapid reoccurrence. Rejection occurred in 5 of 10 kidney transplant recipients but did not occur in any of the four liver transplant recipients. HIV viral loads have remained undetectable in all patients maintained with HAART. CD4 counts have remained stable in patients not treated for rejection. Patients receiving protease inhibitors require 25% of the dose of cyclosporine compared with patients receiving nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: There has been no evidence of significant HIV progression and no adverse effect of HIV on allograft function. Rejection is a concern in kidney transplant recipients, as is the possible poor outcome in hepatitis C virus-coinfected liver transplant recipients. Preliminary data are encouraging and indicate that transplantation should be a treatment option for individuals with well-controlled HIV disease."]}
{"question": "Is the 7th TNM edition suitable for biological predictor in early gastric cancer?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND/AIMS: The clinical and prognostic value of the previous node classification of TNM staging in early gastric cancer (EGC) has been less definitive. The aim was to assess the suitability of the revised node staging for prediction of clinical behavior of EGC. METHODOLOGY: Between 2005 and 2008, 1,845 patients were diagnosed with EGC and underwent surgery at Severance Hospitals. Clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed with comparisons between sixth and seventh TNM staging. RESULTS: When comparing IB with IIA upstaged based on seventh staging, poor differentiation, signet ring cell, diffuse, undifferentiated types, perineural invasion (PNI), larger size and younger age, were more significantly associated with IIA. Clinicopathological factors were compared between N0/N1 and N2/N3 based on both staging. In mucosal cancer, younger age, diffuse and undifferentiated types were more significantly associated with N2/N3 based on seventh staging. In submucosal cancer, larger size, poor differentiation, signet ring cell, diffuse, undifferentiated types, PNI and deeper submucosal invasion, were more significantly associated with N2/N3 based on seventh staging. CONCLUSIONS: Upstaging in EGC based on the revised TNM staging reflects more aggressive biological behavior of cancer. The new TNM staging system may be informative in prediction of biological behavior of EGC as well as prognosis and survival."]}
{"question": "Does growth hormone replacement therapy reduce mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency?", "retrieved_passages": ["Growth hormone (GH) deficiency in adults affects many physiological functions. It may result in reduced muscle volume and strength, changes in body mass, lowered metabolic rate, low energy and sexual drive and impaired cognitive function. GH deficiency may also lead to an increase in mortality due to vascular disorders. However, the benefits of GH replacement are still controversial. Recently, investigators have looked at the effects of GH replacement therapy on the well-being of patients. However, the studies which have been published generally have small sample sizes, use inadequate methodology and employ health status measures that lack the necessary sensitivity. Despite these weaknesses, results suggest that replacement GH does have a positive effect on well-being. A GH-specific quality-of-life measure has now been produced, which will provide a clearer view of the benefits of replacement therapy for patients. The use of this measure should help guide decisions about the necessity of providing replacement therapy for GH-deficient patients.", "Growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD) in adults is well-characterized and includes abnormal body composition, reduced bone mass, an adverse cardiovascular risk profile, and impaired quality of life. In the early 1990s, it was also shown that patients with hypopituitarism without GH replacement therapy (GHRT) had excess mortality. Today, GHRT has been shown to decrease or reverse the negative effects of GHD. In addition, recent papers have shown that mortality and morbidity are approaching normal in hypopituitary patients with GHD who receive modern endocrine therapy including GHRT. Since the first dose-finding studies, it has been clear that efficacy and side effects differ substantially between patients. Many factors have been suggested as affecting responsiveness, such as sex, age, age at GHD onset, adherence, and GH receptor polymorphisms, with sex and sex steroid replacement having the greatest impact. Therefore, the individual tailoring of GH dose is of great importance to achieve sufficient efficacy without side effects. One group that stands out is women receiving oral estrogen replacement, who needs the highest dose. Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is still the most used biochemical biomarker for GH dose titration, although the best serum IGF-1 target is still debated. Patients with GHD due to acromegaly, Cushing's disease, or craniopharyngioma experience similar effects from GHRT as others. Arch Endocrinol Metab. 2019;63(6):592-600.", "CONTEXT: Adults with GH deficiency (GHD) have a decreased life expectancy. The effect of GH treatment on mortality remains to be established. OBJECTIVE: This nationwide cohort study investigates the effect of GH treatment on all-cause and cause-specific mortality and analyzes patient characteristics influencing mortality in GHD adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Patients in the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults were retrospectively monitored (1985-2009) and subdivided into treatment (n = 2229), primary (untreated, n = 109), and secondary control (partly treated, n = 356) groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated for all-cause, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Expected mortality was obtained from cause, sex, calendar year, and age-specific death rates from national death and population counts. RESULTS: In the treatment group, 95 patients died compared to 74.6 expected [SMR 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.56)]. Mortality was higher in women than in men. After exclusion of high-risk patients, the SMR for CVD mortality remained increased in women. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated. In the control groups mortality was not different from the background population. Univariate analyses demonstrated sex, GHD onset, age, and underlying diagnosis as influencing factors. CONCLUSIONS: GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "The acute metabolic actions of purified human growth hormone (GH) were first documented in adult hypopituitary patients more than 50 years ago, and placebo-controlled long-term GH trials in GH-deficient adults (GHDA) surfaced in 1989 with the availability of biosynthetic human GH. Untreated GHDA is associated with excess morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease and the phenotype includes fatigue, reduced aerobic exercise capacity, abdominal obesity, reduced lean body mass, osteopenia and elevated levels of circulating cardiovascular biomarkers. Several of these features reverse and normalize with GH replacement. It remains controversial whether quality of life, assessed by questionnaires, improves. The known side effects are fluid retention and insulin resistance, which are reversible and dose dependent. The dose requirement declines markedly with age and is higher in women. Continuation of GH replacement into adulthood in patients with childhood-onset disease is indicated, if the diagnosis is reconfirmed. GH treatment of frail elderly subjects without documented pituitary disease remains unwarranted. Observational data show that mortality in GH-replaced patients is reduced compared to untreated patients. Even though this reduced mortality could be due to selection bias, GH replacement in GHDA has proven beneficial and safe.", "The beneficial effects of somatropin (growth hormone [GH] replacement therapy) in adults are now established. Long-term somatropin administration in GH-deficient adults improves body composition, muscle strength, quality of life, bone mass and density, and lipoprotein pattern. The extent to which somatropin therapy can also reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in GH-deficient adults remains to be determined. By starting with a low dose of somatropin, which is gradually increased based on clinical response (body composition, well-being, and serum insulin-like growth factor-1 concentration), effective treatment can be achieved with a minimum of fluid-related adverse effects. Thorough long-term monitoring of glucose metabolism, cardiovascular measurements, and underlying pituitary disease, is, however, mandatory."]}
{"question": "Attaining negative margins in breast-conservation operations: is there a consensus among breast surgeons?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The purpose of this survey was to ascertain the most common surgical practices for attaining negative (tumor-free) surgical margins in patients desiring breast-conservation treatment for breast cancer to see if a consensus exists for optimal treatment of patients. STUDY DESIGN: We sent a survey to 1,000 surgeons interested in the treatment of breast cancer. Three hundred eighty-one surgeons responded to this survey and 351 were used for the analysis (response rate of 38%). RESULTS: Answers showed a large variety in clinical practices among breast surgeons across the country. There was little intraoperative margin analysis; only 48% of surgeons examine the margins grossly with a pathologist and even fewer used frozen sections or imprint cytology. Decisions to reexcise specific margins varied greatly. For example, 57% of surgeons would never reexcise for a positive deep margin, but 53% would always reexcise for a positive anterior margin. Most importantly, there was a large range in answers about acceptable margins with ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma. Fifteen percent of surgeons would accept any negative margin, 28% would accept a 1-mm negative margin, 50% would accept a 2-mm negative margin, 12% would accept a 5-mm negative margin, and 3% would accept a 10-mm negative margin. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in breast-conservation treatment.", "As little time ago as 1991 the NIH Consensus conference could not agree on the need for negative margins. Today, negative margin status has become a prerequisite for BCT recognizing that positive margins impact negatively on local recurrence rates. The science of margin evaluation is fast becoming recognized to play a key role in providing patients with the opportunity for breast conservation therapy as well as the best possible cosmetic result. Preoperative factors that predict a greater likelihood of failure to obtain margins such as larger tumor size and positive lymph nodes are fixed and can only be dealt with by taking larger biopsies. RODEO-MRI can preoperatively predict probability of success or failure and can actual better define tumor dimensions and extent and help plan excisions. Use of intraoperative US may be a future tool used to facilitate the excision of non-palpable and possibly palpable tumors. Intraoperative pathological assessment should not be performed by frozen section but consideration given to cytological assessment so as to allow feedback to the surgeon intraoperatively as to which margin needs more attention. Finally, using all the above methods of obtaining negative margins, the surgeon may have the ability to impact the outcome of breast cancer surgery and recurrence.", "Breast cancer is the most common tumor affecting women worldwide. Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) followed by irradiation nowadays is the treatment of choice for early-stage disease; there is no difference in long-term survival between mastectomy and BCT combined with external radiotherapy. A positive margin is associated with increased risk of local recurrences after BCT for invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ. The exact definition of an adequate surgical margin after breast cancer resection has long been debated among physicians and represents an area of considerable variation in clinical practice. There is a lack of standardization in the pathology methods of margin evaluation, which yields little consensus regarding what constitutes an adequate negative margin. As a consequence, patient management varies widely based on the threshold that surgeons accept for adequate margins and the subsequent need for re-excision. We analyze and discuss recent literature about this topic both from the pathological and from the surgical point of view.", "The 1992 NIH Consensus Development Conference reported that \"breast conservation treatment is an appropriate method of primary therapy for the majority of women with stage I and II breast cancer and is preferable because it provides survival equivalent to total mastectomy and axillary dissection while preserving the breast.\" This conclusion has been solidly confirmed by recent updates of all of the prospective clinical trials performed. The uneven utilization of this BCS indicates the personal discomfort of some surgeons in recommending it or in communicating their recommendations to patients. The appropriate candidate for mastectomy is the patient in whom it is evident that BCS will not control the tumor. This conclusion may be drawn after one or even two attempts at revision have shown more extensive microscopic disease. The experience with preoperative chemotherapy programs such as NSABP Protocol B-18 shows that even for larger tumors primary excision or excision after preoperative chemotherapy provides reasonable rates of local control with no evidence of diminished distant control or survival. Very large tumors, often accompanied by other grave signs, are best treated by primary chemotherapy, because they are essentially not stage I or stage II disease. Although recognizing that better long-term cure rates are a function of the treatment of micrometastases with adjuvant chemotherapy, surgeons should remember the need to balance cosmetic factors with techniques required for good local control. Cosmetic factors are always important, but the primary concern is adequate removal of the primary tumor with pathologically negative margins. The best way to prevent the need for a salvage mastectomy following local recurrence is to obtain adequate control at the initial procedure, but this does not mean that aggressive local surgery is needed, and it certainly does not mean that a primary mastectomy is needed except in unusual cases.", "INTRODUCTION: Prior to the \"no ink on tumor\" SSO/ASTRO consensus guideline, approximately 20% of women with stage I/II breast cancers undergoing breast conservation surgery at our institution underwent margin re-excision. On May 20, 2013, our institution changed the definition of negative margins from 2 mm to \"no ink on tumor.\" METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who had surgery at our institution with clinical stage I/II breast cancers between June 1, 2011 and May 1, 2015. In the pre-guideline cohort (pre) and post-guideline cohort (post), negative margins were 2 mm and \"no ink on tumor,\" respectively. RESULTS: Implementation of the guideline resulted in a significant decrease in the positive/close margin rate (29.6% pre vs 10.1% post; P < 0.001) and numerical decrease in re-excision rate (20.4% pre vs 16.3% post; P = 0.104). No significant difference was found in local recurrence between the cohorts with limited follow-up (1.2% pre vs 1.5% post; P = 0.787). CONCLUSION: The implementation of the \"no ink on tumor\" guideline at our institution has resulted in a significant decrease in positive margin rates and a numerical decrease in margin re-excisions. In addition to margin status, surgeons continue to use individual patient and histologic factors to decide for or against margin re-excision."]}
{"question": "Can serum be used for analyzing the EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as prognostic or predictive marker in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been used widely. However, it may be difficult to get tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in large proportion of patients with advanced disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We obtained pairs of tumor and serum samples from 57 patients with advanced NSCLC, between March 2006 and January 2009. EGFR mutation status from tumor samples was analyzed by genomic polymerase chain reaction and direct sequence and EGFR mutation status from serum samples was determined by the peptide nucleic acid locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction clamp. RESULTS: EGFR mutations were detected in the serum samples of 11 patients and in the tumor samples of 12 patients. EGFR mutation status in the serum and tumor samples was consistent in 50 of the 57 pairs (87.7%). There was a high correlation between the mutations detected in serum sample and the mutations detected in the matched tumor sample (correlation index 0.62; P<0.001). Twenty-two of 57 patients (38.5%) received EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors as any line therapy. The response for EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors was significantly associated with EGFR mutations in both tumor samples and serum samples (P<0.05). There was no significant differences in overall survival according to the status of EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "The status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten ras (KRAS) mutations has been used widely in management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it may be difficult to get tumor tissues for analyzing the status of EGFR and KRAS mutation in large proportion of patients with advanced disease. We obtained pairs of tumor and serum samples from 57 patients with advanced NSCLC, between March 2006 and January 2009. EGFR mutation status from tumor samples and KRAS mutation status from serum samples were analyzed by genomic polymerase chain reaction and direct sequence, and EGFR mutation status from serum samples was determined by the peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid PCR clamp. EGFR mutations were detected in the serum samples of 11 patients and in the tumor samples of 12 patients. Fourteen patients revealed (?) KRAS mutation in the serum sample. EGFR mutation status in the serum and tumor samples was consistent in 50 (87.7 %) of the 57 pairs (correlation index 0.62, p < 0.001). Only 5 of 57 (8.7 %) patients showed mutation of both EGFR and KRAS in serum sample. Twenty-two of 57 patients (38.5 %) received EGFR-TKIs as any line therapy. The response for EGFR-TKIs was significantly associated with EGFR mutations in both tumor samples and serum samples (p < 0.05). The status of KRAS mutation in serum was not predictive for the response of EGFR-TKI (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in OS according to the status of EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples (p > 0.05) and KRAS mutations in serum samples (p > 0.05). The status of EGFR and KRAS mutation in serum was not prognostic in patients with advanced NSCLC. However, the clinical usefulness of EGFR mutation of serum as a selection marker for EGFR-TKIs sensitivity in NSCLC might be allowed, not KRAS mutation.", "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a distinct subgroup of NSCLC, which is particularly responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The aim of this study is to detect EGFR mutations in paired serum of pre- and post-chemotherapy from advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients to evaluate impact of chemotherapy on EGFR mutation status. METHODS: Magnetic beads were used for DNA extraction from paired serum of pre- and post-chemotherapy of 33 advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients. The EGFR exon 19 and 21 were amplified by mutant-enriched nested PCR and analyzed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: EGFR mutations were detected in 39.4% (13/33) and 54.5% (18/33) serum samples of pre- and postchemotherapy, respectively. The EGFR mutation status was consistent in 54.5% (18/33) patients. Among 15 discordant cases, 10 changed from pre-chemo wild-type to post-chemo mutant-type status, while 5 from pre-chemo mutant-type to post-chemo wild-type status.

HYPOTHESIS: Pretreatment serum proteomics predicts survival in Western advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with wild-type EGFR and independent of KRAS mutation status. METHODS: We analyzed available biospecimens from Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 3503, a single-arm phase II study of erlotinib in first-line advanced lung cancer, for proteomics signatures in the previously described serum matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization proteomic classifier (VeriStrat) as well as for KRAS and EGFR mutations. RESULTS: Out of 137 enrolled patients, analyzable biologic samples were available on 102. Nine of 41 (22%) demonstrated KRAS mutations and 3 of 41 (7%) harbored EGFR mutations. VeriStrat classification identified 64 of 88 (73%) as predicted to have \"good\" and 24 of 88 (27%) predicted to have \"poor\" outcomes. A statistically significant correlation of VeriStrat status (p < 0.001) was found with survival. EGFR mutations, but not KRAS mutations, also correlated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: The previously defined matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization predictor remains a potent and highly clinically significant predictor of survival after first-line treatment with erlotinib in patients with wild-type EGFR and independent of mutations in KRAS.", "BACKGROUND: Plasma cell-free Deoxyribo nucleic acid epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation tests are widely used at initial diagnosis and at progression in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We analyzed the factors associated with plasma EGFR mutation detection and the effect of plasma EGFR genotyping on the clinical outcomes of the patients with treatment-naive stage IV NSCLC. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included subjects with treatment-naive stage IV NSCLC who underwent plasma EGFR genotyping between 2018 and 2020. The presence of plasma EGFR mutation was determined by real-time polymeric chain reaction. RESULTS: The prevalence of EGFR mutation in this cohort was 52.7% (164/311). Among 164 EGFR mutant subjects, 34 (20.7%) were positive for the plasma EGFR mutation assay only. In multivariable analysis, the detection of plasma EGFR mutation was significantly related to higher serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, never-smoker status, N3 stage, and brain or intrathoracic metastasis. The time to treatment initiation (TTI) of the plasma EGFR mutation-positive group (14 days) was shorter than that of the plasma EGFR mutation-negative group (21 days, p < 0.001). More patients received the 1st line EGFR-TKI in the plasma positive group compared with the tissue positive group. CONCLUSION: Smoking status and the factors reflecting tumor burden were associated with the detection of plasma EGFR mutation. The plasma EGFR mutation assay can shorten the TTI, and facilitate the 1st line EGFR-TKI therapy for patients with treatment-naive stage IV NSCLC, especially in the region of high-prevalence of EGFR mutation."]}
{"question": "Do Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differ on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Although the Internet is commonly used to recruit samples in studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related risk behaviors, it has not been used to measure patient-reported well-being. As the burden of long-term chronic HIV infection rises, the Internet may offer enormous potential for recruitment to research and interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare two samples of gay men living with HIV, one recruited via the Web and the other recruited in outpatient settings, in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden. METHODS: The Internet sample was recruited from a UK-wide Web-based survey of gay men with diagnosed HIV. Of these, 154 respondents identified themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this analysis. RESULTS: The Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 0.74). In multivariable logistic regression, for the physical symptom burden model, adjusted for age, ethnicity, employment status, and ART use, the recruitment setting (ie, Web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated with high physical symptom score. The only variable that remained significantly associated with high physical symptom score was employment status, with those in employment being less likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical symptom tertile versus the other two tertiles (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.62, P<.001). For the psychological symptom burden model, those recruited via the Web were significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) tertile (adjusted OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.41-3.44, P=.001). In addition, those in employment were less likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological symptom tertile compared to those not in employment (adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21-0.49, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites."]}

{"question": "Expression of c-kit protooncogen in hepatitis B virus-induced chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma: has it a diagnostic role?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: There are more than 350 million people worldwide chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), who are at high risk for the development of hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of the conflicting results about c-kit expression in HCC and the key role played by c-kit in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) and other solid tumours, the aim of this study was to determine c-kit expression in the course of hepatitis B infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissues in Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine Department of Pathology between January 2002 and February 2006 were searched restrospectively to investigate this issue. We performed immunohistochemistry on biopsies of 125 patients with HBV infection, grouped as: mild, moderate and severe hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC, 25 patients in each of them, using anti c-kit monoclonal antibody. The severity of parenchymal inflammation and of interface hepatitis was semiquantitatively graded on a haematoxylin and eosin stained paraffin sections. Additionally, 50 more HCC, formed on HBV basis, were studied to determine the prevalence of c-kit overexpression. RESULTS: In cirrhotic liver, lower intensity of staining and rarely c-kit positivity were present. The greatest number of the c-kit positivity and higher intensity of staining was found in the livers of patients with severe hepatitis and HCC. In chronic hepatitis B infection, the staining intensity was parallel with the grade and stage of the disease. In the areas where fibrosis was seen, c-kit positivity was rare or absent. In the HCC specimens, c-kit positivity appeared both inside and around the cancerous nodes. C-kit expression was observed in 62 of 75 HCC tissue specimens (82%) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: C-kit positivity was observed in the mitotic, proliferating and also dysplastic hepatic cells. These results suggest that c-kit expression may be used as an early diagnostic indicator for HBV induced HCC."]}
{"question": "Longer term quality of life and outcome in stroke patients: is the Barthel index alone an adequate measure of outcome?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: To consider whether the Barthel Index alone provides sufficient information about the long term outcome of stroke. DESIGN: Cross sectional follow up study with a structured interview questionnaire and measures of impairment, disability, handicap, and general health. The scales used were the hospital anxiety and depression scale, mini mental state examination, Barthel index, modified Rankin scale, London handicap scale, Frenchay activities index, SF36, Nottingham health profile, life satisfaction index, and the caregiver strain index. SETTING: South east London. SUBJECTS: People, and their identified carers, resident in south east London in 1989-90 when they had their first in a life-time stroke aged under 75 years. INTERVENTIONS: Observational study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison and correlation of the individual Barthel index scores with the scores on other outcome measures. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty three (42%) people were known to be alive, of whom 106 (86%) were interviewed. The median age was 71 years (range 34-79). The mean interval between the stroke and follow up was 4.9 years. The rank correlation coefficients between the Barthel and the different dimensions of the SF36 ranged from r = 0.217 (with the role emotional dimension) to r = 0.810 (with the physical functioning dimension); with the Nottingham health profile the range was r = -0.189 (with the sleep dimension, NS) to r = -0.840 (with the physical mobility dimension); with the hospital and anxiety scale depression component the coefficient was r = -0.563, with the life satisfaction index r = 0.361, with the London handicap scale r = 0.726 and with the Frenchay activities index r = 0.826. CONCLUSIONS: The place of the Barthel index as the standard outcome measure for populations of stroke patients is still justified for long term follow up, and may be a proxy for different outcome measures intended for the assessment of other domains."]}
{"question": "Do women residents delay childbearing due to perceived career threats?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To assess gender differences among residents regarding their plans to have children during residency and determine the most influential reasons for these differences. METHOD: Using the Health Belief Model as a framework, the authors created an instrument to survey 424 residents from 11 residency programs at three academic medical institutions about their intentions to have children during residency. The authors developed a scale to assess the perceived career threats of having children during residency, evaluated its psychometric properties, and calculated the effect of the mediators. RESULTS: The response rate was 77% (328/424). Forty-one percent of men versus 27% of women planned to have children during residency (P = .01). The instrument measured four career threats-extended training, loss of fellowship positions, pregnancy complications, and interference with career plans-on a five-point Likert scale. The scale had a Cronbach alpha of 0.84 and an eigenvalue of 2.2. Compared with men, women had higher scores for each item and a higher mean score (2.9 versus 2.1, P = .001), signifying greater belief in the potential of pregnancy to threaten careers. After adjusting for age, institution, postgraduate year, and knowledge of parental leave policies, women were less likely to plan to have children during residency (odds ratio 0.46 [95% confidence interval 0.25-0.84]). In mediation analysis, threats to career explained 67% of the gender variance. CONCLUSIONS: Women residents intentionally postpone pregnancy because of perceived threats to their careers.

PATIENTS: 35,435 admissions based on five years' routine recordings from the two hospitals. MAIN RESULTS: The total rate of admission to general hospitals was lower in peripheral municipalities with a GP hospital than in central municipalities without this kind of institution, 26% and 28% lower for men and women respectively. The corresponding differences were 38% and 52%, when analysed for occupied bed days. The differences were most pronounced for patients with respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, and cancer who are primarily or intermediately treated or cared for in GP hospitals, and for patients with stroke and fractures, who are regularly transferred from general hospitals to GP hospitals for longer term follow up care.

Since the team has been in operation, the number of times ambulances have to be diverted to other hospitals has been reduced.", "INTRODUCTION: The complexity of care required by many older people living in long-term care (LTC) facilities poses challenges that can lead to potentially avoidable referrals to a hospital emergency department (ED). The Aged Residential Care Intervention Project (ARCHIP) ran an implementation study to evaluate a multidisciplinary team (MDT) intervention supporting LTC facility staff to decrease potentially avoidable ED presentations by residents. METHODS: ARCHIP (conducted in 21 facilities [1,296 beds] with previously noted high ED referral rates) comprised clinical coaching for LTC facility staff by a gerontology nurse specialist (GNS) and an MDT (facility senior nurse, resident's general practitioner, GNS, geriatrician, pharmacist) review of selected high-risk residents' care-plans. A before-after repeated measures analysis was conducted for 9 months before and 9 months after intervention commencement (a 29-month period because of staggered facility enrolment). Modelling was adjusted for time trend, seasonality, facility size, and cluster effect. RESULTS: ED admission rate ratio post- versus pre-intervention was 0.75 (95% C.I. 0.63, 0.89, p-value = 0.0008), a 25% reduction in ED presentations post-intervention. A sensitivity model used a shorter, staggered time period centred on intervention start (9 months pre-intervention and 9 months post-intervention) for each facility, and a four-level categorical intervention variable testing intervention effect over time. The sensitivity test showed a 24% reduction in ED presentations in months 1-3 post-intervention (p-value = 0.07), a 34% reduction in months 4-6 (p-value = 0.01), and a 32% reduction in ED presentations in months 7-9 (p-value = 0.03). However, when the higher ED referral rates for 3 months immediately pre-intervention were modelled, the impact of the intervention on ED presentation rates reverted almost to previous levels. KEY CONCLUSIONS: A GNS-led MDT outreach intervention, targeted at selected conditions, decreases avoidable ED admissions of high-risk residents from selected facilities.", "Duration of stay for unselected admissions to an acute psychiatric ward was reduced to an average of 11 days. The clinical methods by which this was achieved are described. Comparing patients randomly allocated to this experimental ward and other admission wards: (i) the readmission rate to the experimental ward was higher but readmissions were briefer so that total in-patient experience per patient over the course of one year remained substantially lower; (ii) symptom levels and burden on the family had improved equally at three weeks and at four months after discharge; (iii) experimental ward patients made fewer demands on their general practitioners and reported fewer parasuicides. Beds can be released for other purposes in this way."]}
{"question": "Informed consent for total hip arthroplasty: does a written information sheet improve recall by patients?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether a written information sheet is acceptable to patients and improves recall of the consent interview. DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled study using questionnaires, comparing a group of patients given information in a written sheet with appropriate explanation to a group given verbal information alone. SETTING: A specialist orthopaedic surgery unit. PATIENTS: The test group was 126 patients undergoing revision or primary total hip arthroplasty; 65 patients were given information verbally, 61 patients were given written information. OUTCOME MEASURE: Patients' recall of information given, tested with a questionnaire completed on admission (mean of 18 days later). RESULTS: The patients receiving written information scored significantly higher (48% correct answers) than the patients receiving verbal information (38% correct answers). CONCLUSIONS: Written information sheets contribute to the process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what was discussed."]}
{"question": "Discharging patients earlier from Winnipeg hospitals: does it adversely affect quality of care?", "retrieved_passages": ["A population-based approach was used to monitor impact of hospital bed closures in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Four years of administrative data were analyzed. Access to hospital services was not adversely affected: The reduction in beds resulted in increases in outpatient surgery and earlier discharges. In addition, access favored the admission of persons with more health care needs. Quality of care, as measured by mortality within 3 months of admission, readmission rates within 30 days of discharge, and increased contact with physicians within 30 days of discharge, did not change. The health status of the Winnipeg population, measured by premature mortality, did not change. However, health status and hospital use was found to be strongly related to socioeconomic status. In light of this gradient, the authors conclude that well designed and evaluated experiments that focus on the determinants of health, rather than on providing more health care services, could help identify ways of reducing hospital use.", "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether decreasing lengths of stay over time for selected diagnostic categories were associated with increased hospital readmission rates and mean number of physician visits after discharge. DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive study. SETTING: The seven large (125 beds or more) acute care hospitals in Winnipeg. PATIENTS: Manitoba residents admitted to any one of the seven hospitals because acute myocardial infarction (AMI), bronchitis or asthma, transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) and uterine or adnexal procedures for nonmalignant disease during the fiscal years 1989-90 to 1992-93. Patients from out of province, those who died in hospital, those with excessively long stays (more than 60 days) and those who were transferred to or from another institution were excluded. OUTCOME MEASURES: Length of hospital stay, and rate of readmission within 30 days after discharge for all four categories and mean number of physician visits within 30 days after discharge for two categories (AMI and bronchitis or asthma. RESULTS: The length of stay decreased significantly over the 4 years for all of the four categories, the smallest change being observed for patients with AMI (11.1%) and the largest for those with bronchitis or asthma (22.0%). The readmission rates for AMI, bronchitis or asthma, and TURP showed no consistent change over the 4 years. The readmission rate for uterine or adnexal procedures increased significantly between the first and second year (chi 2 = 4.28, p = 0.04) but then remained constant over the next 3 years. The mean number of physician visits increased slightly for AMI in the first year (1.92 to 2.01) and then remained virtually the same. It decreased slightly for bronchitis or asthma over the 4 years. There was no significant correlation between length of stay and readmission rates for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in any of the four categories. Also, no correlation was observed between length of stay and mean number of physician visits for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in the categories AMI and bronchitis or asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates."]}
{"question": "Does the distribution of health care benefits in Kenya meet the principles of universal coverage?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The 58th World Health Assembly called for all health systems to move towards universal coverage where everyone has access to key promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative health interventions at an affordable cost. Universal coverage involves ensuring that health care benefits are distributed on the basis of need for care and not on ability to pay. The distribution of health care benefits is therefore an important policy question, which health systems should address. The aim of this study is to assess the distribution of health care benefits in the Kenyan health system, compare changes over two time periods and demonstrate the extent to which the distribution meets the principles of universal coverage. METHODS: Two nationally representative cross-sectional households surveys conducted in 2003 and 2007 were the main sources of data. A comprehensive analysis of the entire health system is conducted including the public sector, private-not-for-profit and private-for-profit sectors. Standard benefit incidence analysis techniques were applied and adopted to allow application to private sector services. RESULTS: The three sectors recorded similar levels of pro-rich distribution in 2003, but in 2007, the private-not-for-profit sector was pro-poor, public sector benefits showed an equal distribution, while the private-for-profit sector remained pro-rich. Larger pro-rich disparities were recorded for inpatient compared to outpatient benefits at the hospital level, but primary health care services were pro-poor. Benefits were distributed on the basis of ability to pay and not on need for care. CONCLUSIONS: The principles of universal coverage require that all should benefit from health care according to need. The Kenyan health sector is clearly inequitable and benefits are not distributed on the basis of need. Deliberate efforts should be directed to restructuring the Kenyan health system to address access barriers and ensure that all Kenyans benefit from health care when they need it."]}
{"question": "Cholesterol screening in school children: is family history reliable to choose the ones to screen?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: Hyperlipidemia is a major factor accompanying atherosclerosis. As the basis of atherosclerotic heart disease begins at early childhood, we aim to find out which children should be tested for hypercholesterolemia, what the high cholesterol level in children is and what cautions should be taken to avoid atherosclerosis. METHODS: The study was carried on 2096 school children (1043 male, 1053 female) in Ankara. Their mean age was 9.03 years. Demographic properties of the study group and their families were determined and the serum lipid levels of the subjects were obtained. The relation between these demographic properties and lipid levels were investigated. RESULTS: In 135 of the subjects' serum cholesterol level was >or=200 mg/dL and in 83 subjects serum LDL-cholesterol level was >or=130 mg/dL. Despite 64.4% of the subjects reported a family history of hyperlipidemia, no relations between family history and serum lipid levels were found. CONCLUSION: We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors."]}

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between humeral and glenoid defects based on quantitative radiological criteria. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed between 2000 and 2011 including patients who underwent primary surgical shoulder stabilization for chronic posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability, with bone defects in both the glenoid and humerus and a healthy contralateral shoulder. The following measurements were taken: D/R ratio (Hill-Sachs lesion depth/humeral head radius) on an AP X-ray in internal rotation and the D1/D2 ratio [diameter of the involved glenoid articular surfaces (D1)/the healthy one (D2)] on a comparative Bernageau glenoid profile view. Measurements were taken by two observers. Correlations were determined by the Spearman correlation coefficients (r), Bland and Altman diagrams, and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). A sample size calculation was done. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included, 25 men/5 women, mean age 29.8 +/- 11.2 years. The mean D/R was 23 +/- 12 % for observer 1 and 23 +/- 10 % for observer 2. The mean D1/D2 was 95 +/- 4 % for observer 1 and 94 +/- 6 % for observer 2. No significant correlation was found between humeral and glenoid bone defects by observer 1 (r = 0.23, p = 0.22) or observer 2 (r = 0.05, p = 0.78). Agreement of the observers for the D/R ratio was excellent (ICC = 0.89 +/- 0.04, p < 0.00001) and good for the D1/D2 ratio (ICC = 0.54 +/- 0.14, p = 0.006).

{"question": "Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback. SETTING: Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: 1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest. RESULTS: Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.

{"question": "Does ambulatory process of care predict health-related quality of life outcomes for patients with chronic disease?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The validity of quality of care measurement has important implications for practicing clinicians, their patients, and all involved with health care delivery. We used empirical data from managed care patients enrolled in west coast physician organizations to test the hypothesis that observed changes in health-related quality of life across a 2.5-year window reflecting process of care. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Patient self-report data as well as clinically detailed medical record review regarding 963 patients with chronic disease associated with managed care from three west coast states. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of change in health-related quality of life scores across 30 months as measured by change in SF-12 physical component scores. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Patient self-report and medical record abstraction. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found a positive relationship between better process scores and higher burden of illness (p<.05). After adjustment for burden of illness, using an instrumental variables approach revealed better process is associated with smaller declines in SF-12 scores across a 30-month observation window (p=.014). The application of the best quartile of process of care to patients currently receiving poor process is associated with a 4.24 increment in delta SF-12-physical component summary scores. CONCLUSIONS: The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "OBJECTIVES: This study examined the prospective effect of reported access to medical care on health-related quality-of-life outcomes in patients with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. METHODS: A cohort study was designed with interviews at baseline, follow-up interviews at 3 months after baseline, mortality follow-up through 6 months after baseline, and medical record reviews for selected baseline clinical data. Participants were HIV-infected patients who were receiving ambulatory and/or hospital care at one county-run municipal and one Veterans Administration hospital in metropolitan Los Angeles and were interviewed about access to medical care (using a reliable 9-item scale assessing affordability, availability, and convenience of medical care). Access to care reported by this sample was compared with that of 2,471 patients with other chronic diseases from the Medical Outcomes Study. The main outcome measures were composite scores for physical and mental health-related quality of life 3 months after baseline, derived from a validated 56-item instrument, scored from 0 to 100, and controlling for baseline health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Overall reported access to medical care in this sample was significantly poorer than that for patients with other chronic diseases (means scores were 63 and 73, respectively). The sample was categorized into tertiles of initial physical and mental health-related quality of life and into groups with initial high versus low access to care. Among those in the middle tertile of physical health-related quality of life at baseline, those with high access improved in physical health scores by 10.2 points relative to those with low access. Those in the low and middle tertiles of initial mental health improved in mental health to a significantly greater extent for those with high versus low access. There were nonsignificant trends toward similar effects for most other subgroups. The effects of access on health-related quality-of-life outcomes were generally robust in multivariate regression analyses that included CD4, hemoglobin, albumin, insurance status, and sociodemographic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Access to care at baseline predicted better physical and mental health outcomes at 3 months for those in the middle tertile of physical health and for those in the bottom and middle tertiles of mental health at baseline. Increasing access to care for poor public hospital patients with HIV infection may help to improve health-related quality-of-life outcomes among selected persons with advanced disease.", "Heart failure is a chronic disease requiring careful attention to self-care. Patients must follow instructions for diet and medication use to prevent or delay a decline in functional status, quality of life, and expensive care. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in heart failure patients' knowledge of important care routines, their cognition, and their health literacy, which predict the ability to implement self-care. Our interdisciplinary team of cognitive scientists with health literacy expertise, pharmacists, and physicians spent 18 years designing and testing protocols and materials to assist ambulatory heart failure patients with their care. Our approach is theory- as well as problem-driven, guided by our process-knowledge model of health literacy as it relates to self-care among older adult outpatients with either heart failure or hypertension. We used what we had learned from this model to develop a pharmacy-based protocol and tailored patient instruction materials that were the central component of a randomized clinical trial. Our results showed improved adherence to cardiovascular medications, improved health outcomes and patient satisfaction, and direct cost reductions. These results demonstrate the value of our interdisciplinary efforts for developing strategies to improve instruction and communication with attention to health literacy, which are core components of pharmacy and other ambulatory healthcare services. We believe attention to health literacy with medication use will result in improved health outcomes for older adult patients with heart failure and other complex chronic diseases.", "INTRODUCTION: Integrated service delivery is considered to be an essential condition for improving the management and health outcomes of people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, research on the assessment of integrated care by patients and care providers is hindered by the absence of brief, reliable, and valid measurement tools. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop survey instruments for healthcare professionals and patients based on the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care (RMIC), and to evaluate their psychometric properties. DESIGN: The development process was based on the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. This included item generation from systematic reviews of existing tools and expert opinion on clarity and content validity, involving renal care providers and chronic kidney patients. A cross-sectional, multi-centre design was used to test for internal consistency and construct validity. SETTING: Outpatient clinics in a large renal network. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 30.788 CKD patients, and 8.914 renal care providers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Both survey instruments were developed using previous qualitative work and published literature. A multidisciplinary expert panel assessed the face and content validity of both instruments and following a pilot study, the psychometric properties of both instruments were explored. Exploratory factor analysis with principal axis factoring and with promax rotation was used to assess the underlying dimensions of both instruments; Cronbach's alpha was used to determine the internal constancy reliability. RESULTS: 17.512 patients (response rate: 56.9%) and 8.849 care providers (response rate: 69.5%) responded to the questionnaires. Factor analysis of the patient questionnaire yielded three internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7) factors: person-centeredness, clinical coordination, and professional coordination. Factor analysis of the provider questionnaire produced eight internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7) factors: person-centeredness, community centeredness, clinical coordination, professional coordination, organisational coordination, system coordination, technical and cultural competence. As hypothesised, care coordination patient and providers scores significantly correlated with questions about quality of care, treatment involvement, reported health, clinics' organisational readiness, and external care coordination capacity. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for the reliability and validity of the RMIC patient and provider questionnaires as generic tools to assess the experience with or perception of integrated renal care delivery. The instruments are recommended in future applications testing test-retest reliability, convergent and predictive validity, and responsiveness.", "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The association of social support with outcomes in ESRD, overall and by peritoneal dialysis (PD) versus hemodialysis (HD), remains understudied. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In an incident cohort of 949 dialysis patients from 77 US clinics, we examined functional social support scores (scaled 0 to 100 and categorized by tertile) both overall and in emotional, tangible, affectionate, and social interaction subdomains. Outcomes included 1-year patient satisfaction and quality of life (QOL), dialysis modality switching, and hospitalizations and mortality (through December 2004). Associations were examined using overall and modality-stratified multivariable logistic, Poisson, and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: We found that mean social support scores in this population were higher in PD versus HD patients (overall 80.5 versus 76.1; P < 0.01). After adjustment, highest versus lowest overall support predicted greater 1-year satisfaction and QOL in all patients (odds ratio 2.47 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 5.15] and 2.06 [95% CI 1.31 to 3.22] for recommendation of center and higher mental component summary score, respectively). In addition, patients were less likely to be hospitalized (incidence rate ratio 0.86; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98). Results were similar with subdomain scores. Modality switching and mortality did not differ by social support in these patients, and associations of social support with outcomes did not generally differ by dialysis modality. CONCLUSIONS: Social support is important for both HD and PD patients in terms of greater satisfaction and QOL and fewer hospitalizations. Intervention studies to possibly improve these outcomes are warranted."]}
{"question": "Does perspective-taking increase patient satisfaction in medical encounters?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To assess whether perspective-taking, which researchers in other fields have shown to induce empathy, improves patient satisfaction in encounters between student-clinicians and standardized patients (SPs). METHOD: In three studies, randomly assigned students (N = 608) received either a perspective-taking instruction or a neutral instruction prior to a clinical skills examination in 2006-2007. SP satisfaction was the main outcome in all three studies. Study 1 involved 245 third-year medical students from two universities. Studies 2 and 3 extended Study 1 to examine generalizability across student and SP subpopulations. Study 2 (105 physician assistant students, one university) explored the effect of perspective-taking on African American SPs' satisfaction. Study 3 (258 third-year medical students, two universities) examined the intervention's effect on students with high and low baseline perspective-taking tendencies. RESULTS: Intervention students outscored controls in patient satisfaction in all studies: Study 1: P = .01, standardized effect size = 0.16; Study 2: P = .001, standardized effect size = 0.31; Study 3: P = .009, standardized effect size = 0.13. In Study 2, perspective-taking improved African American SPs' satisfaction. In Study 3, intervention students with high baseline perspective-taking tendencies outscored controls (P = .0004, standardized effect size = 0.25), whereas those with low perspective-taking tendencies did not (P = .72, standardized effect size = 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: Perspective-taking increased patient satisfaction in all three studies, across medical schools, clinical disciplines, and racially diverse students and SPs.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 260 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer fulfilling high-risk criteria, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) or the combination of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC) every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued until complete remission plus two cycles, or until disease progression. In the case of partial remission or stable disease, treatment was stopped after 12 cycles. Second-line treatment was vindesine, mitomycin and prednisolone. Gain from treatment was estimated using a modified Brunner's score composed of time to progression, patients' rating of the treatment benefit, alopecia, vomiting and performance status. RESULTS: After recruitment from 1992 to 1997 and observation from 1997 to 1999, the final evaluation showed that single-agent treatment with mitoxantrone does not differ significantly from combination treatment with FEC in terms of response, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to response, time to best response, time to progression or overall survival. There was, however, a significant difference in gain from treatment using a modified Brunner's score favoring the single-agent treatment arm. There was no evidence that any subgroup would fare better with combination treatment. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was detected between the treatment with mitoxantrone as a single agent and the combination of low-dose FEC in terms of response or survival; therefore, the imperative of the necessity of first-line combination chemotherapy for patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer may be questioned. Since toxicity and quality of life score favored the single-agent mitoxantrone treatment arm, this treatment may be offered to patients preferring quality of life to a potential small prolongation of survival."]}
{"question": "Are patients with Werlhof's disease at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients. METHODS: Between 05/95 and 07/98, ten patients with WD (eight males, two females) underwent cardiac surgery employing extracorporeal circulation (WD-group). Five of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria. RESULTS: Mean number of platelet counts were significant lower in the WD-group than in the no-WD-group despite a significant increase of platelet counts after immunoglobulin treatment (54/nl-->112/nl, P=0.018). On the day before, directly after and on the first day after surgery they were 141/nl vs. 215/nl (P=0.012), 75/nl vs. 147/nl (P=0.001) and 93/nl vs. 136/nl (P=0.009). Accordingly, patients of the WD-group received significantly more platelet concentrates than patients of the no-WD-group (mean number of platelet concentrates: 2.3 versus 0.7, P=0.007). Total drainage loss via the mediastinal chest tubes was almost identical (1197 ml in the no-WD-group and 1140 ml in the WD-group). One patient of each group suffered from a bleeding complication requiring reexploration. Three patients of the no-WD-group (6%) and one patient of the WD-group (10%) expired postoperatively unrelated to WD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with WD may possibly undergo cardiac surgery without a markedly enhanced risk for bleeding complications despite a more than usual transfusion requirement and significantly lower platelet counts perioperatively.", "BACKGROUND: Patients with Werlhof's disease and undergoing a cardiac surgical procedure with cardiopulmonary bypass are at increased risk for bleeding complications. We report the usefulness of preoperative immunoglobulin treatment in selected patients. METHODS: Between May 1995 and July 1998, 10 patients with Werlhof's disease underwent a cardiac surgical procedure with cardiopulmonary bypass in our department. Five patients with mean platelet counts of less than 80x10(9)/L received immunoglobulin therapy preoperatively (group 1). The other 5 patients with mean platelet counts higher than 80x10(9)/L were not so treated (group 2). RESULTS: In group 1, mean platelet count increased from 54x10(9)/L 5 days before operation to 112x10(9)/L after immunoglobulin treatment (p = 0.018) and did not fall to less than 60x10(9)/L postoperatively. Patients in group 1 received 16 units of packed red blood cells and 5 units of platelet concentrate. Patients in group 2 required 24 units of packed red blood cells, 5 units of platelet concentrate, and 23 units of fresh frozen plasma. Only 1 patient (group 2) had a surgical bleeding complication that required reexploration. Mean drainage loss was 1,100 mL in group 1 and 1,210 mL in group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that immunoglobulin treatment of patients with Werlhof's disease and mean platelet counts of less than 80x10(9)/L significantly augments platelet counts preoperatively. It may be useful in selected patients.", "Patients with pre-existing coagulopathies who undergo surgical interventions are at increased risk for bleeding complications. This risk is especially true in cardiac surgical procedures with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) because of the necessity for heparinization and the use of the extracorporeal circuits, which have destructive effects on most of the blood components. In this review, cases of cardiac surgeries in patients with certain pre-existing coagulopathies are summarized, which could shed a light on future managements of such patients undergoing cardiac procedures with CPB. Pre-existing coagulopathies include antithrombin III deficiency, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cancer, factor XII deficiency, hemophilia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, protein S deficiency, and drug-induced platelet inhibition. In summary, pre-existing coagulopathy in patients undergoing open-heart surgeries, if not recognized and appropriately managed, can cause serious complications. Management of patients undergoing cardiac procedures should include a routine coagulation work-up and a thorough past medical history examination. If any of the foregoing is abnormal, further evaluation is warranted. Proper diagnosis and management of the pre-existing coagulopathy disorders is of crucial importance to the surgical outcome and long-term morbidity.", "A 66-year-old male undergoing maintenance hemodialysis presented with mild thrombocytopenia. He also had aortic valve stenosis and required aortic valve replacement. In addition, he required anticoagulation therapy with warfarin because of chronic subclavian artery occlusion. He was eventually diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), although there were no bleeding tendencies. The patient was preoperatively treated with thrombopoietin receptor agonist (romiplostim((R))) because of the risk of bleeding complication during cardiac surgery. The platelet count rapidly increased with low-dose romiplostim, and no thrombotic complication occurred. During surgery, no significant bleeding complications were observed. This report suggests that romiplostim is a useful treatment option for the management of bleeding complication during cardiac surgery in a hemodialysis patient with ITP.", "BACKGROUND Chronic immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) is associated with a higher incidence of adverse outcomes, increased morbidity and mortality rates, and higher health care costs, especially in open-heart surgery. The information regarding managing chronic ITP in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement (MVR) surgery is scarce, and reported cases are limited. CASE REPORT A 42-year-old woman with more than 20 years of history of immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) had episodes of breathing difficulties in the last 4 years. The patient was diagnosed with severe mitral stenosis (MS) and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). Laboratory examination before surgery showed thrombocytopenia (49 000/microL). Therefore, the surgery was postponed until the platelet count exceeded 100 000/microL. The patient was given 10 units of thrombocyte concentrate 1 day before surgery and 500 mg of methylprednisolone 3 times a day orally for 5 days as preoperative management. Under a total cardiopulmonary bypass, MVR was performed using a bioprosthetic valve. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed no valvular leakage in the surrounding of the prosthetic valve and that the valve was functioning normally. Platelet monitoring was conducted, and the platelet count increased to 147 000/microL on the third day. CONCLUSIONS Our case report shows that aggressive preoperative platelet count correction and treatment may lower the risk associated with a low and unstable platelet count and reduce the risk of mortality and morbidity in patients with ITP who undergo MVR procedures."]}
{"question": "Is neck pain associated with worse health-related quality of life 6 months later?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Current evidence suggests that neck pain is negatively associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, these studies are cross-sectional and do not inform the association between neck pain and future HRQoL. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between increasing grades of neck pain severity and HRQoL 6 months later. In addition, this longitudinal study examines the crude association between the course of neck pain and HRQoL. STUDY DESIGN: This is a population-based cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Eleven hundred randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were the mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary (PCS) of the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. METHODS: We formed a cohort of 1,100 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults in September 1995. We used the Chronic Pain Questionnaire to measure neck pain and its related disability. The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure physical and mental HRQoL 6 months later. Multivariable linear regression was used to measure the association between graded neck pain and HRQoL while controlling for confounding. Analysis of variance and t tests were used to measure the crude association among four possible courses of neck pain and HRQoL at 6 months. The neck pain trajectories over 6 months were no or mild neck pain, improving neck pain, worsening neck pain, and persistent neck pain. Finally, analysis of variance was used to examine changes in baseline to 6-month PCS and MCS scores among the four neck pain trajectory groups. RESULTS: The 6-month follow-up rate was 74.9%. We found an exposure-response relationship between neck pain and physical HRQoL after adjusting for age, education, arthritis, low back pain, and depressive symptomatology. Compared with participants without neck pain at baseline, those with mild (beta=-1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]=-2.83, -0.24), intense (beta=-3.60, 95% CI=-5.76, -1.44), or disabling (beta=-8.55, 95% CI=-11.68, -5.42) neck pain had worse physical HRQoL 6 months later. We did not find an association between neck pain and mental HRQoL. A worsening course of neck pain and persistent neck pain were associated with worse physical HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: We found that neck pain was negatively associated with physical but not mental HRQoL. Our analysis suggests that neck pain may be a contributor of future poor physical HRQoL in the population. Raising awareness of the possible future impact of neck pain on physical HRQoL is important for health-care providers and policy makers with respect to the management of neck pain in populations.", "STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to elucidate the impact of axial pain following cervical laminoplasty on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Axial neck pain is a frequently encountered complication after laminoplasty. However, limited information is available regarding the time-dependent changes in axial pain and the impact of this pain on clinical outcomes, including HRQOL. METHODS: One hundred sixty-two consecutive patients with cervical myelopathy underwent double-door laminoplasty using hydroxyapatite spacers from 2008 to 2012. The outcome measures included the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score (JOA score), the EuroQol 5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D), and the Short Form-36 survey (SF-36). The intensity of axial pain was assessed using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS). These assessments were conducted preoperatively and at 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-ups. Patient satisfaction with outcome was graded using a 7-point NRS at the 2-year follow-up. RESULT: One hundred twenty-one patients completed the 2-year follow-up. The mean axial pain intensity decreased slightly over time; however, the decrease was not significant. The JOA score, EQ-5D score, and all SF-36 domains, excluding general health perceptions, improved significantly compared with baseline levels at the 6-month follow-up or later. Baseline axial pain intensity showed a significant negative correlation with baseline HRQOL only in the SF-36 bodily pain domain. In contrast, axial pain intensity showed significant negative correlations with all HRQOL measures at the 6-month follow-up. At the 2-year follow-up, patients with an axial pain intensity >/=3 showed significantly worse outcomes than did patients with a pain intensity <3 in the EQ-5D score, SF-36 score, and patient satisfaction grades, but not in the JOA score. CONCLUSION: Axial neck pain has a significant negative impact on clinical outcomes, including a wide range of HRQOL measures and patient satisfaction with outcome, in patients undergoing conventional double-door laminoplasty. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.", "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of low back pain (LBP) on future health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Current evidence suggests that individuals with LBP have poorer HRQoL than those without LBP. However, most of the evidence comes from cross-sectional studies where LBP and HRQoL are determined at the same time. One prospective study examined the association between days with LBP and HRQoL but did not account for the intensity of LBP. Therefore, this association needs to be tested in a large prospective population-based sample with a valid measure of LBP and adequate control of known confounders. METHODS: We formed a cohort of 1,110 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults in September 1995. LBP at baseline was measured with the chronic pain questionnaire. The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure physical and mental HRQoL at 6 months follow-up. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate the association between graded LBP at baseline and HRQoL at 6 months while controlling for the effects of confounding. RESULTS: The 6-month follow-up rate was 70.7 % (785/1,110). LBP had a dose-response relationship with worsening physical HRQoL at 6 months, after controlling for age, income, arthritis, neck pain, and kidney disorders: grade III-IV LBP (beta = -10.23; 95 % CI -12.46, -7.99), grade II LBP (beta = -6.72, 95 % CI -8.79, -4.65), and grade I LBP (beta = -1.77; 95 % CI -3.18, -0.36). There was no dose-response relationship between LBP and mental HRQoL at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Low back pain has an impact on future physical HRQoL. Strategies for reducing the effects of LBP on HRQoL should be an important focus for clinicians, researchers, and health policy makers.", "PURPOSE: Parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for head-and-neck cancer reduces xerostomia compared with standard RT. To assess potential improvements in broader aspects of quality of life (QOL), we initiated a study of patient-reported QOL and its predictors after IMRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective longitudinal study of head-and-neck cancer patients receiving multisegmental static IMRT. Patients were given a validated xerostomia questionnaire (XQ), and a validated head-and-neck cancer-related QOL questionnaire consisting of four multi-item domains: Eating, Communication, Pain, and Emotion. The Eating domain contains one question (total of six) asking directly about xerostomia. In both questionnaires, higher scores denote worse symptoms or QOL. The questionnaires and measurements of salivary output from the major glands were completed before RT started (pre-RT) and at 3, 6, and 12 months after RT. The association between the QOL scores and patient-, tumor-, and therapy-related factors was assessed using the random effects model. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients participating in the study completed the questionnaires through 12 months. The XQ scores worsened significantly at 3 months compared with the pre-RT scores, but later they improved gradually through 12 months (p = 0.003), in parallel with an increase in the salivary output from the spared salivary glands. The QOL summary scores were stable between the baseline (pre-RT) and 3 months after RT scores. Patients receiving postoperative RT (whose pre-RT questionnaires were taken a few weeks after surgery) tended to have improved scores after RT, reflecting the subsidence of acute postoperative sequelae, compared with a tendency toward worsened scores in patients receiving definitive RT. After 3 months, statistically significant improvement was noted in the summary QOL scores for all patients, through 12 months after RT (p = 0.01). The salivary flow rates, tumor doses, mean oral cavity dose, age, gender, sites or stages of tumor, surgery, and use of chemotherapy were not associated with the QOL scores at any point. The mean dose to the parotid glands correlated with the QOL scores at 3 months (p = 0.05) but not at other post-RT periods. The XQ and QOL summary scores did not correlate before RT but were significantly correlated at each post-RT point (p < 0.01), with a linear correlation coefficient (r) of 0.59, 0.72, and 0.67 at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. At these points, the XQ scores also correlated significantly with the scores of each of the individual QOL domains (p < or = 0.01), including the domains Pain and Emotion, which did not contain any xerostomia-related question. CONCLUSION: After parotid-sparing IMRT, a statistically significant correlation was noted between patient-reported xerostomia and each of the domains of QOL: Eating, Communication, Pain, and Emotion. Both xerostomia and QOL scores improved significantly over time during the first year after therapy. These results suggest that the efforts to improve xerostomia using IMRT may yield improvements in broad aspects of QOL.", "IMPORTANCE: Procrastination is prevalent among university students and is hypothesized to lead to adverse health outcomes. Previous cross-sectional research suggests that procrastination is associated with mental and physical health outcomes, but longitudinal evidence is currently scarce. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between procrastination and subsequent health outcomes among university students in Sweden. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was based on the Sustainable University Life study, conducted between August 19, 2019, and December 15, 2021, in which university students recruited from 8 universities in the greater Stockholm area and Orebro were followed up at 5 time points over 1 year. The present study used data on 3525 students from 3 time points to assess whether procrastination was associated with worse health outcomes 9 months later. EXPOSURE: Self-reported procrastination, measured using 5 items from the Swedish version of the Pure Procrastination Scale rated on a Likert scale from 1 (\"very rarely or does not represent me\") to 5 (\"very often or always represents me\") and summed to give a total procrastination score ranging from 5 to 25. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sixteen self-reported health outcomes were assessed at the 9-month follow-up. These included mental health problems (symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress), disabling pain (neck and/or upper back, lower back, upper extremities, and lower extremities), unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (poor sleep quality, physical inactivity, tobacco use, cannabis use, alcohol use, and breakfast skipping), psychosocial health factors (loneliness and economic difficulties), and general health. RESULTS: The study included 3525 participants (2229 women [63%]; mean [SD] age, 24.8 [6.2] years), with a follow-up rate of 73% (n = 2587) 9 months later. The mean (SD) procrastination score at baseline was 12.9 (5.4). An increase of 1 SD in procrastination was associated with higher mean symptom levels of depression (beta, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.09-0.17), anxiety (beta, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.04-0.12), and stress (beta, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.08-0.15), and having disabling pain in the upper extremities (risk ratio [RR], 1.27; 95% CI, 1.14-1.42), poor sleep quality (RR, 1.09, 95% CI, 1.05-1.14), physical inactivity (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.11), loneliness (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.12), and economic difficulties (RR, 1.15, 95% CI, 1.02-1.30) at the 9-month follow-up, after controlling for a large set of potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of Swedish university students suggests that procrastination is associated with subsequent mental health problems, disabling pain, unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, and worse psychosocial health factors. Considering that procrastination is prevalent among university students, these findings may be of importance to enhance the understanding of students' health."]}
{"question": "Is there a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether sublingual varices are constant or inconstant over time and whether this is connected to background variables, cardiovascular risk factors or disease. DESIGN: This longitudinal observational study was performed between 2010 and 2020 at the Public Dental Services Vastra Vall, Varberg, Sweden. The study was based on 431 patients included in a previous study in which the relationship between sublingual varices and hypertension was examined. In connection to the annual dental examination, 281 patients were included in the follow-up study. They completed a questionnaire about background and health factors and diseases. Length and weight were measured. Two intraoral photos were taken with a digital camera. Two dentists independent of each other graded all photographs as none/few visible sublingual varices (nSV) or medium/severe sublingual varices (SV). RESULTS: The prevalence of SV was 25.6% at baseline and 30.6% at follow-up. At the follow up, a total of 76.5% had maintained their sublingual vascular status. Of those with nSV at baseline (n209), 80.9% still had nSV, and 19.1% had developed SV during the 8-year follow-up period. Of those 72 participants who had SV at baseline, 46 (63.9%) were unchanged at follow-up, and 26 (36.1%) were classified as nSV. Those who had developed SV at follow-up had a higher mean age (p = 0.003) and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), 13.2% versus 3.0% (p = 0.021). This association with CVD did not persist after an adjustment for sex and age (OR 3.2, 95% CI 0.81-12.46). They exhibited more hypertension (35.0% vs. 22.5%) and diabetes type 2 (7.5% vs. 3.0%), but with no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that 76.5% of the participants had an unchanged status regarding sublingual varices during an 8-year period and that the development from nSV to SV was associated with advanced age."]}
{"question": "Can CT predict the level of CSF block in tuberculous hydrocephalus?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: Treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus in children with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) depends on the level of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) block. Air-encephalography is regarded as the gold standard for differentiating communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus. Since air-encephalography involves a lumbar puncture, it carries the risk of cerebral herniation. AIM. The aim of this study was to determine whether communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus in TBM can be differentiated by means of cranial computerised tomography (CT). METHODS: A number of CT indices were measured in 50 children with communicating and 34 children with non-communicating hydrocephalus according to air-encephalographic findings. RESULTS: The only CT finding that correlated with the type of hydrocephalus was the shape of the third ventricle. Significantly more children with non-communicating hydrocephalus had a rounded third ventricle than those with communicating hydrocephalus. CONCLUSION: CT is therefore not useful in determining the level of CSF block in TBM. Air-encephalography remains the most reliable way of determining the level of CSF obstruction."]}
{"question": "MR arthrography of the shoulder: do we need local anesthesia?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To assess pain intensity with and without subcutaneous local anesthesia prior to intraarticular administration of contrast medium for magnetic resonance arthrography (MRa) of the shoulder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center study was conducted after an IRB waiver of authorization, between January 2010 and December 2012. All patients provided written, informed consent for the procedure. Our prospectively populated institutional database was searched, based on our inclusion criteria. There were 249 outpatients (178 men and 71 women; mean age, 44.4 years +/- 14.6; range, 15-79) who underwent MRa and were enrolled in this study. Patients were excluded if they had received surgery of the shoulder before MRa, had undergone repeated MRa of the same shoulder, and/or had undergone MRa of both shoulders on the same day. Patients were randomly assigned into one of three groups. Patients in group A (n=61) received skin infiltration with local anesthesia. Patients in control group B (n=92) and group C (n=96) did not receive local anesthesia. Pain levels were immediately assessed after the injection for MRa using a horizontal visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 to 10. To compare the pain scores of the three groups for male and female patients, a two-way analysis of variance was used. A p-value equal to or less than 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant result. RESULTS: Patients who received local anesthesia (group A) showed a mean pain level on the VAS of 2.6 +/- 2.3. In patients who did not receive local anesthetics (groups B and C), a mean pain level on the VAS of 2.6 +/- 2.2 and 2.7 +/- 2.4 were detected, respectively. Between the three groups, no statistically significant difference in pain intensity was detected (p=.960). There were significant differences in subjective pain perception between men and women (p=.009). Moreover, the sex difference in all three groups was equal (p=.934). CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort."]}
{"question": "Should cavitation in proximal surfaces be reported in cone beam computed tomography examination?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: A clinical study was done to assess the clinical diagnostic accuracy of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in detecting proximal cavitated carious lesions in order to determine whether cavitation should be reported when a CBCT examination is available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 79 adjacent proximal surfaces without restorations in permanent teeth were examined. Patients suspected to have carious lesions after a visual clinical and a bitewing examination participated in a CBCT examination (Kodak 9000 3D, 5 x 3.7 cm field of view, voxel size 0.07 mm). Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained according to the Helsinki Declaration. Radiographic assessment recording lesions with or without cavitation was performed by two observers in bitewings and CBCT sections. Orthodontic separators were placed interdentally between two lesion-suspected surfaces. The separator was removed after 3 days and the surfaces recorded as cavitated (yes/no), i.e. validated clinically. Differences between the two radiographic modalities (sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy) were estimated by analyzing the binary data in a generalized linear model. RESULTS: For both observers, sensitivity was significantly higher for CBCT than for bitewings (average difference 33%, p < 0.001) while specificity was not significantly different between the methods (p = 0.19). The overall accuracy was also significantly higher for CBCT (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: CBCT was more accurate in detecting cavitation in proximal surfaces than bitewing radiographs; therefore a CBCT examination performed for other clinical applications should also be assessed for proximal surface cavities in teeth without restorations, and when detected, this pathology must be part of the dentist's report."]}
{"question": "Do supervised colorectal trainees differ from consultants in terms of quality of TME surgery?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The quality of surgical excision is held to be a major determinant of outcome following surgery for rectal cancer. Macroscopic examination of the excised mesorectum allows for reproducible assessment of the quality of surgery. We aimed to determine whether quality of excision undertaken by colorectal trainees under supervision was comparable with that performed by consultants, as measured using mesorectal grades. METHOD: A total of 130 consecutive patients undergoing potentially curative resection for primary adenocarcinoma of the rectum in our centre from 2001 to 2003 were included in the study. The pathologists graded the excised mesorectum according to staged classification proposed by Quirke. The outcome (quality of mesorectal excision and secondary outcomes including local recurrence and overall recurrence) of operations performed by consultants was compared with that of trainees. Statistical significance was tested using Pearson chi(2) test. RESULTS: Eighty-nine operations were performed by consultants and 41 by senior colorectal trainees with consultant supervision. Forty-four patients (49%) had good mesorectum when operated by consultants in comparison with 17 (41.5%) by the trainees. There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.717) between the two groups in terms of quality of mesorectum excised after potentially curative resection. Furthermore, there were seven local recurrences in patients operated by consultants (7.8%) when compared with four in the trainee group (9.5%) and once again there was no statistical significance between the two groups (P = 0.719). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants."]}
{"question": "Do socioeconomic differences in mortality persist after retirement?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of death associated with work based and non-work based measures of socioeconomic status before and after retirement age. DESIGN: Follow up study of mortality in relation to employment grade and car ownership over 25 years. SETTING: The first Whitehall study. SUBJECTS: 18,133 male civil servants aged 40-69 years who attended a screening examination between 1967 and 1970. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death. RESULTS: Grade of employment was a strong predictor of mortality before retirement. For men dying at ages 40-64 the lowest employment grade had 3.12 times the mortality of the highest grade (95% confidence interval 2.4 to 4.1). After retirement the ability of grade to predict mortality declined (rate ratio 1.86; 1.6 to 2.2). A non-work based measure of socioeconomic status (car ownership) predicted mortality less well than employment grade before retirement but its ability to predict mortality declined less after retirement. Using a relative index of inequality that was sensitive to the distribution among socioeconomic groups showed employment grade and car ownership to have independent associations with mortality that were of equal magnitude after retirement. The absolute difference in death rates between the lowest and highest employment grades increased with age from 12.9 per 1000 person years at ages 40-64 to 38.3 per 1000 at ages 70-89. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic differences in mortality persist beyond retirement age and in magnitude increase with age. Social differentials in mortality based on an occupational status measure seem to decrease to a greater degree after retirement than those based on a non-work measure. This suggests that alongside other socioeconomic factors work itself may play an important part in generating social inequalities in health in men of working age.", "AIMS: There are substantial differences in remaining life expectancy at higher ages between occupational groups. These differences may be the effect of work-related exposures, lifestyle factors of workers in specific occupations, socioeconomic position or a combination of this. The scope of this paper is the extent to which occupational differences in remaining life expectancy persist after retirement, which would suggest that occupational exposures alone are not likely to explain all the difference. METHODS: All individuals born between 1925 and 1939 who reported occupational information in the Census 1985 and were residents in Sweden to the end of 2020 or who died were included and followed for death until 2020. The Nordic Classification of Occupations was used to create nine occupational groups. Partial life expectancy and age-specific death rates were applied to examine mortality differentials. RESULTS: This study showed substantial differences in partial life expectancy across the occupational cohorts with the biggest difference being about 2 years. The mortality differences persisted with increasing age, both when measured as absolute numbers as well as relative numbers. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of convergence in mortality at high ages suggests that factors associated with lifestyle may play a larger role than occupational factors for the mortality differences between occupational groups at high ages. However, it cannot be ruled out that long-lasting effects of earlier occupational exposures also contribute. Regardless of the exact mechanism, we conclude that there is room for further reduction in mortality at high ages and, thus, for further improvement in life expectancy.", "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the association between socioeconomic status and mortality rates cuts across the major causes of death for middle aged and elderly men. DESIGN: 25 year follow up of mortality in relation to employment grade. SETTING: The first Whitehall study. PARTICIPANTS: 18,001 male civil servants aged 40-69 years who attended the initial screening between 1967 and 1970 and were followed up for at least 25 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Specific causes of death. RESULTS: After more than 25 years of follow up of civil servants, aged 40-69 years at entry to the study, employment grade differences still exist in total mortality and for nearly all specific causes of death. Main risk factors (cholesterol, smoking, systolic blood pressure, glucose intolerance and diabetes) could only explain one third of this gradient. Comparing the older retired group with the younger pre-retirement group, the differentials in mortality remained but were less pronounced. The largest decline was seen for chronic bronchitis, gastrointestinal diseases and genitourinary diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Differentials in mortality persist at older ages for almost all causes of death.", "BACKGROUND: Past research shows that spousal death results in elevated mortality risk for the surviving spouse. However, most prior studies have inadequately controlled for socioeconomic status (SES), and it is unclear whether this 'widowhood effect' persists over time. METHODS: Health and Retirement Study participants aged 50+ years and married in 1998 (n = 12 316) were followed through 2008 for widowhood status and mortality (2912 deaths). Discrete-time survival analysis was used to compare mortality for the widowed versus the married. RESULTS: Odds of mortality during the first 3 months post-widowhood were significantly higher than in the continuously married (odds ratio (OR) for men = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.27, 2.75; OR for women = 1.47, 95% CI: 0.96, 2.24) in models adjusted for age, gender, race and baseline SES (education, household wealth and household income), behavioral risk factors and co-morbidities. Twelve months following bereavement, men experienced borderline elevated mortality (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.35), whereas women did not (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.28), though the gender difference was non-significant. CONCLUSION: The 'widowhood effect' was not fully explained by adjusting for pre-widowhood SES and particularly elevated within the first few months after widowhood. These associations did not differ by sex.", "BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to estimate occupational differences in self-rated health, both in cross-section and over time, among older individuals. METHODS: We use hierarchical linear models to estimate self-reported health as a function of 8 occupational categories and key covariates. We examine self-reported health status over 7 waves (12 years) of the Health and Retirement Study. Our study sample includes 9,586 individuals with 55,389 observations. Longest occupation is used to measure the cumulative impact of occupation, address the potential for reverse causality, and allow the inclusion of all older individuals, including those no longer working. RESULTS: Significant baseline differences in self-reported health by occupation are found even after accounting for demographics, health habits, economic attributes, and employment characteristics. But contrary to our hypothesis, there is no support for significant differences in slopes of health trajectories even after accounting for dropout. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that occupation-related differences found at baseline are durable and persist as individuals age."]}
{"question": "Can emergency physicians accurately and reliably assess acute vertigo in the emergency department?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To validate a clinical diagnostic tool, used by emergency physicians (EPs), to diagnose the central cause of patients presenting with vertigo, and to determine interrater reliability of this tool. METHODS: A convenience sample of adult patients presenting to a single academic ED with isolated vertigo (i.e. vertigo without other neurological deficits) was prospectively evaluated with STANDING (SponTAneousNystagmus, Direction, head Impulse test, standiNG) by five trained EPs. The first step focused on the presence of spontaneous nystagmus, the second on the direction of nystagmus, the third on head impulse test and the fourth on gait. The local standard practice, senior audiologist evaluation corroborated by neuroimaging when deemed appropriate, was considered the reference standard. Sensitivity and specificity of STANDING were calculated. On the first 30 patients, inter-observer agreement among EPs was also assessed. RESULTS: Five EPs with limited experience in nystagmus assessment volunteered to participate in the present study enrolling 98 patients. Their average evaluation time was 9.9 +/- 2.8 min (range 6-17). Central acute vertigo was suspected in 16 (16.3%) patients. There were 13 true positives, three false positives, 81 true negatives and one false negative, with a high sensitivity (92.9%, 95% CI 70-100%) and specificity (96.4%, 95% CI 93-38%) for central acute vertigo according to senior audiologist evaluation. The Cohen's kappas of the first, second, third and fourth steps of the STANDING were 0.86, 0.93, 0.73 and 0.78, respectively. The whole test showed a good inter-observer agreement (k = 0.76, 95% CI 0.45-1).

{"question": "Orthostatic myoclonus: an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, orthostatic myoclonus (OM) has been suggested as a cause of gait impairment and unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of orthostatic myoclonus, its clinical characteristics and the underlying associated neurological disorders. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of clinical data and electromyogram surface recordings from subjects with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment was performed. Diagnosis of OM was made when a pattern of non-rhythmic bursts was observed (duration range 20-100 ms; bursts per second </=16). RESULTS: Among 93 subjects studied, OM was the most frequent disorder (n = 16; 17.2%), followed by orthostatic tremor (13.9%) and low frequency tremors during orthostatism (12.9%). All patients with OM complained about unsteadiness during orthostatism and/or during gait. Leg jerking was only observed by visual inspection during orthostatism in four subjects and two also presented falls. Eleven out of 16 patients (68.7%) with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease, such as multiple system atrophy (n = 3) Parkinson's disease (n = 2), Alzheimer's disease (n = 2), mild cognitive impairment (n = 2) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 2). Although four subjects showed improvement of orthostatic myoclonus with antimyoclonic treatment, the follow-up was not systematic enough to evaluate their therapeutic effect on OM. CONCLUSIONS: Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often complain of unsteadiness. This can occur as the result of various neurological dysfunctions, including changes in postural adjustments, loss of postural reflexes, axial akinesia and rigidity, freezing and/or postural hypotension. In some cases these symptoms remain unexplained, and rare cases of unsteadiness have been attributed to tremor on standing. To delineate this condition, we investigated 11 consecutive PD patients with unexplained unsteadiness because of tremor on standing, seen in our department over a 6-year period. All the patients had detailed clinical and electrophysiological investigations based on surface polygraphic electromyographic recordings. Four patients had fast orthostatic tremor (13-18 Hz), one had intermediate orthostatic tremor (8-9 Hz), and three had slow orthostatic tremor (4-6 Hz). The remaining 3 patients had orthostatic myoclonus, a condition that has not previously been reported in PD. Patients with fast tremor improved on clonazepam. Patients with slow tremor and myoclonus improved on levodopa and sometimes benefited further when clonazepam was added. These observations show the usefulness of neurophysiological investigations for diagnosing and treating unexplained unsteadiness in Parkinson's disease."]}
{"question": "Is the cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis apoptotic?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is characterized by neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Studies on experimental models and patients with intractable epilepsy suggest that apoptosis may be involved in neuronal death induced by recurrent seizures. METHODS: We searched evidence for apoptotic cell death in temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin fragment, fractin. The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years). RESULTS: Unlike that in normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the reactive astroglia. Bax immunopositivity was increased in almost all neurons. Fractin immunostaining, an indicator of caspase activity, was detected in approximately 10% of these neurons. Despite increased Bax expression and activation of caspases, we could not find evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining. We also could not detect typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology by Hoechst-33258 or hematoxylin counterstaining. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is often characterized pathologically by severe neuronal loss in the hippocampus. In this study we investigated concomitant appearance of the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mechanisms in injured neurons in epileptic human hippocampi. Postsurgical hippocampal specimens of randomly selected 25 patients with MTLE were studied with standard immunohistochemical techniques to detect the below markers of cell death pathways: truncated Bid - tBid, mitochondrial translocation of Bax (markers of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein activation) and nuclear translocation of AIF (caspase-independent pro-apoptotic pathway). For cell survival pathways, we investigated the expression of c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and Hsp70 (heat shock protein). Immunopositive cells were counted in different regions of the hippocampus. We also verified IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) expression with Western blotting. The results were statistically compared with hippocampi from non-epileptic autopsy controls. In patient hippocampi, Bax and tBid immunoreactivity were significantly increased and Bax staining was consistent with mitochondrial translocation. AIF was not translocated to the nucleus. c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were barely detectable in control hippocampi, whereas their expression was dramatically increased in the patients in all hippocampal subfields. Interestingly, these neurons were also positively co-labeled for tBid and translocated Bax. Hsp70 immunreactivity was significantly increased in all surviving neurons in patient hippocampi whereas degenerating neurons failed to express Hsp70. Our findings are consistent with both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mechanisms being active within the same hippocampal neurons of patients with MTLE, illustrating an ongoing struggle between cell death and survival mechanisms in neurons under stress.", "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is usually associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS), characterized by gliosis and neuronal loss, mainly in the cornus ammonis (CA). Regardless the type of HS, gliosis is associated with neuronal loss. Indeed, glial reactivation seems to induce both neuronal and glial apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic mechanisms are also activated in order to contain the cell death in chronic epilepsy. However, the role of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in human TLE is unclear, mainly in relation to glial death. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reactive gliosis areas in parallel with Bcl-2/Bax ratio and active caspase 3 immunoreactivity in hippocampi of TLE patients in comparison with control hippocampi. We also sought to investigate whether the levels of these markers were correlated with TLE clinical parameters. Paraffin-embedded sclerotic and control hippocampi were collected for immunohistochemical analyses of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), human leucocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR), neuronal nuclei protein (NeuN), Bax, Bcl-2 and active caspase 3. Sclerotic hippocampi presented higher immunoreactivity areas of GFAP and HLA-DR than controls, with similar values in HS types 1 and 2. Bcl-2 protein expression was increased in epileptic hippocampi, while Bax expression was similar to controls. Despite Bcl2/Bax ratio increase, granular neurons and glia exhibited active caspase 3 expression in TLE hippocampi, while controls did not show staining for the same marker. In conclusion, glial and neuronal death is increased in sclerotic hippocampi, independently of HS type, and co-localized with gliosis. Furthermore, Bcl-2/Bax ratio increase does not prevent expression of active caspase 3 by glia and granular neurons in TLE.", "Cumulative evidence suggests that programmed cell death (apoptosis) may contribute to the progressive hippocampal sclerosis seen in patients with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated cell apoptotic pathway has recently emerged as a vital intrinsic pathway, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process in the epileptic brain remain unclear. We investigated inositol-requiring protein 1alpha (IRE1alpha)-mediated ER stress pro-and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways in resected hippocampi from 32 patients with intractable MTLE. Immunoreactivity for the ER stress markers glucose-regulated proteins 78 and 94 was significantly higher in MTLE hippocampi than in controls. The levels of IRE1alpha, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2), apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which together constitute the IRE1alpha/TRAF2/ASK1/JNK pro-apoptotic signaling pathway, were significantly upregulated in patients with MTLE. Immunoreactivity for caspase-4, a homologue of caspase-12 that is possibly activated by IRE1alpha via TRAF2 following ER stress, and caspase-3 which was a downstream effector of caspase-4, were both detected in MTLE tissue samples. In contrast, immunoreactivity for caspase-4 and caspase-3 were low or absent in control samples. Simultaneously, the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family transcription factor downstream of IRE1alpha which can promote cell survival by upregulation of multiple ER-targeted genes, was also overexpressed and activated in MTLE hippocampi. Our data suggest that chronic epilepsy is associated with ER stress, as well as induction of both IRE1alpha-mediated pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways.", "This study used immunocytochemistry to explore the expression of cyclins A, B, D, and E and the apoptosis-associated Bax protein in hippocampal subfields of 35 lobectomy specimens with medial temporal lobe sclerosis removed for the treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), 2 age-matched controls, and 2 elderly patients suffering from drug-responsive epilepsy. Cyclins A and D were not detected at all in neuronal nuclei. Cyclin E was only rarely detected in neuronal nuclei in drug-controlled and TLE groups and in controls. Cyclin B was expressed in significantly more neuronal nuclei in the hippocampi in TLE than in the other groups studied. The nuclear expression of these proteins suggested that neurons had reentered the cell division cycle and reached the G2 phase. The nuclear expression of cyclin B in the hippocampus from these patients was accompanied by neuronal cytoplasmic expression of the death-related Bax protein. We interpret these neuronal findings as evidence of cell cycle disturbances and a possible apoptotic mechanism of hippocampal neuronal cell death in TLE."]}
{"question": "Does case-mix based reimbursement stimulate the development of process-oriented care delivery?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: Reimbursement based on the total care of a patient during an acute episode of illness is believed to stimulate management and clinicians to reduce quality problems like waiting times and poor coordination of care delivery. Although many studies already show that this kind of case-mix based reimbursement leads to more efficiency, it remains unclear whether care coordination improved as well. This study aims to explore whether case-mix based reimbursement stimulates development of care coordination by the use of care programmes, and a process-oriented way of working. METHODS: Data for this study were gathered during the winter of 2007/2008 in a survey involving all Dutch hospitals. Descriptive and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses were conducted. RESULTS: SEM reveals that adoption of the case-mix reimbursement within hospitals' budgeting processes stimulates hospitals to establish care programmes by the use of process-oriented performance measures. However, the implementation of care programmes is not (yet) accompanied by a change in focus from function (the delivery of independent care activities) to process (the delivery of care activities as being connected to a chain of interdependent care activities). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that hospital management can stimulate the development of care programmes by the adoption of case-mix reimbursement within hospitals' budgeting processes. Future research is recommended to confirm this finding and to determine whether the establishment of care programmes will in time indeed lead to a more process-oriented view of professionals."]}
{"question": "Is there a need for pelvic CT scan in cases of renal cell carcinoma?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether routine pelvic imaging is necessary during postoperative surveillance of pathologic T2-T4 renal cell carcinoma after nephrectomy for curative intent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective single-institution cohort study with 603 subjects undergoing partial or radical nephrectomy of T2-T4 renal cell carcinoma with curative intent was conducted from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2015. Clinical and imaging (CT or MRI) follow-up findings were evaluated in a prospectively maintained registry to determine the timing and location of recurrent and metastatic disease. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with positive or equivocal findings in the pelvis and negative findings in the chest and abdomen. Binomial CIs were calculated and compared with a prespecified minimum detection threshold of 5%. RESULTS: The T category distribution was as follows: T2 (28.9% [174/603]), T3 (70.3% [424/603]), and T4 (0.8% [5/603]). Most (81.8% [493/603]) of the patients underwent radical nephrectomy, and 27.0% (163/603) had recurrence or metastasis (mean time to first recurrence, 600 +/- 695 days). Pelvic imaging findings were negative in 97.0% (585/603) of cases. Four subjects (0.7% [95% CI, 0.2-1.7%]) had isolated positive findings in the pelvis (p < 0.0001 vs the 5% threshold). Two (0.3% overall [95% CI, 0.04-1.1%]) of these positive findings were in subjects who did not have symptoms. CONCLUSION: Routine pelvic imaging of patients undergoing surveillance for asymptomatic T2-T4 renal cell carcinoma after nephrectomy performed with curative intent has minimal value and probably should not be performed.", "BACKGROUND: Urothelial carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor arising from the pelvocalyceal system. Helical computed tomography (CT) is probably the best preoperative-stage modality for the determination of treatment plan and prognosis. PURPOSE: To obtain helical CT imaging features suggesting advanced pelvocalyceal urothelial carcinoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Preoperative CT images in 44 patients with pelvocalyceal urothelial carcinoma were retrospectively reviewed and correlated with the pathological examination to determine imaging features suggesting stage III or IV of the disease. RESULTS: Pathological stages revealed stage I in 16, stage II in three, stage III in 17, and stage IV in eight patients. Seven patients had metastatic lymph nodes. CT imaging showed that renal parenchymal invasion, sinus fat invasion, and lymph node metastasis were highly suggestive of advanced urothelial cell carcinoma (P<0.05). Helical CT sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for advanced pelvocalyceal urothelial carcinoma were 76% (19/25), 84% (16/19), and 80% (35/44), respectively. CONCLUSION: Preoperative helical CT may suggest imaging features of advanced urothelial carcinoma, influencing treatment plan and patient prognosis, even though its accuracy is not so high.", "Renal cell cancer is the most frequently encountered malignant tumor of the kidney. The modern imaging techniques computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play a vital role in the diagnostic work-up of renal masses. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is able to visualize subtle enhancement in hypovascular tumors with high sensitivity. Recent advances in multidetector CT (MDCT) enable high resolution imaging of local findings. CT is able to provide large volume coverage of the chest and abdomen within seconds for the assessment of lymph node and distant metastasis staging. Local renal cell cancer staging can be achieved with similar diagnostic accuracy using CT or MRI. Both modalities allow visualization of a tumor's relationship to the renal collecting system and pelvis, the renal artery and veins including the IVC. It is the radiologist's task to accurately detect and stage renal malignances in order that each individual patient receives the therapy best suited to them.", "OBJECTIVE: For nephron sparing surgery of renal cell carcinoma knowledge of the intrarenal extension of the tumor and infiltration of the renal pelvis, the intrarenal vessels and the perinephric fat is essential. This question is much more difficult to answer compared to the description of staging parameters. Aim of this study is to evaluate the value of multi-slice CT in planning of nephron sparing surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a prospective study 46 patients with suspected renal cell carcinoma underwent a triphasic multi-slice CT (unenhanced, delay 30 s and 120 s). A reconstructed slice thickness of 2 mm in the arterial and parenchymal phase was used to create volume rendered 3D-reconstructions. Based on the source data and multiplanar reconstructed images the extent of the renal cell carcinoma was assessed in terms of size, hilar infiltration, arterial and venous invasions, capsula infiltration and perirenal growth. The results of two blinded readers were correlated with histopathological staging and intraoperative findings. RESULTS: 36 carcinomas were evaluated histopathologically. 10 patients showed no renal cell carcinoma histopathologically. Multi-slice CT allowed us to diagnose the localization and size of all tumors correctly. Infiltration into perinephric fat was correctly excluded in 24/30 and 8/30 cases. Infiltration of the renal pelvis could be excluded in 17/24 and 12/24 cases. The state of venous infiltration could be correctly diagnosed in 29/30 and 27 /30 carcinomas. CONCLUSION: Despite of the high temporal and spatial resolution of multi-slice CT, which allows the delineation of intrarenal arteries as well as renal hilus and the veins, the evaluation of tumor infiltration into the renal hilus, the intrarenal vessels and the perinephric fat remains a diagnostic problem. For planning of nephron sparing surgery, a knowledge of the infiltration in these structures is essential.", "Preoperative computed tomography (CT) was utilized to evaluate 20 patients with primary transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tracts. Of the 20 patients, 18 (90%) had CT visualization of the tumor as either a discrete mass or local ureteral and/or renal pelvic wall thickening; 2 (10%) had false-negative examinations. Seven of the 20 patients (35%) had CT evidence of tumor extension demonstrated by frank tumor invasion beyond the urothelium or by perirenal pelvic and/or periureteral fat streaks. Of the 4 patients with fat streaks, 2 (50%) had superficial tumors (T(A)T2), 1 had a T1 (25%) tumor, and 1 had a T3 (25%) tumor. All 3 patients with CT findings of direct extension of tumor through the wall of the ureter or renal pelvis had T3 tumors. Among the 13 with localized noninvasive tumor on CT, 5 (38%) had superficial tumors (TA, TIS, T1), 5 (38%) had T2 tumors, and 3 (21%) had T3 tumors. Of the 5 patients with enlarged regional lymph nodes (greater than or equal to 1.5 cm) on CT, 2 had tumor confirmed histologically, 2 had subsequent negative CT-guided biopsies, and 1 had a negative lymphadenectomy. Distant metastasis was discovered in 1 patient. The data suggest that when CT demonstrates direct tumor extension through the renal pelvic or ureteral wall, it is a sensitive indicator of high-stage disease. However, in the absence of this finding, CT is of limited value in staging patients with primary transitional cell carcinoma of the pyeloureteral system."]}
{"question": "Is Bare-Metal Stent Implantation Still Justifiable in High Bleeding Risk Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the ischemic and bleeding outcomes of patients fulfilling high bleeding risk (HBR) criteria who were randomized to zotarolimus-eluting Endeavor Sprint stent (E-ZES) or bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation followed by an abbreviated dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration for stable or unstable coronary artery disease. BACKGROUND: DES instead of BMS use remains controversial in HBR patients, in whom long-term DAPT poses safety concerns. METHODS: The ZEUS (Zotarolimus-Eluting Endeavor Sprint Stent in Uncertain DES Candidates) is a multinational, randomized single-blinded trial that randomized among others, in a stratified manner, 828 patients fulfilling pre-defined clinical or biochemical HBR criteria-including advanced age, indication to oral anticoagulants or other pro-hemorrhagic medications, history of bleeding and known anemia-to receive E-ZES or BMS followed by a protocol-mandated 30-day DAPT regimen. The primary endpoint of the study was the 12-month major adverse cardiovascular event rate, consisting of death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization. RESULTS: Compared with patients without, those with 1 or more HBR criteria had worse outcomes, owing to higher ischemic and bleeding risks. Among HBR patients, major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 22.6% of the E-ZES and 29% of the BMS patients (hazard ratio: 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.57 to 0.98; p = 0.033), driven by lower myocardial infarction (3.5% vs. 10.4%; p < 0.001) and target vessel revascularization (5.9% vs. 11.4%; p = 0.005) rates in the E-ZES arm. The composite of definite or probable stent thrombosis was significantly reduced in E-ZES recipients, whereas bleeding events did not differ between stent groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among HBR patients with stable or unstable coronary artery disease, E-ZES implantation provides superior efficacy and safety as compared with conventional BMS.

{"question": "Does minimal access major surgery in the newborn hurt less?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Minimal access surgery (MAS) in adults is associated with less postoperative pain in comparison to conventional 'open' surgery. It is not known whether this holds true for neonates as well. Less pain would imply that opioid consumption can be reduced, which has a beneficial effect on morbidity. AIM: To evaluate potential differences in' opioid consumption between neonates undergoing thoracoscopic minimal access surgery or conventional surgery of esophageal atresia (EA) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study we included two controls for each MAS patient, matched on diagnosis, sex and age at surgery. Opioid dose titration was based on validated pain scores (VAS and COMFORT behaviour), applied by protocol. Cumulative opioid doses at 12, 24, 48 h and 7 days postoperatively were compared between groups with the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 24 MAS patients (14 EA; 10 CDH). These were matched to 48 control patients (28 EA; 20 CDH). At none of the time points cumulative opioid (median in mg/kg (IQR)) doses significantly differed between MAS patients and controls, both with CDH and EA. For example at 24 h postoperative for CDH patients cumulative opioid doses were [0.84(0.61-1.83) MAS vs. 1.06(0.60-1.36) p=1.0] controls, For EA patients at 24 h the cumulative opioid doses were [0.48(0.30-0.75) MAS vs. 0.49(0.35-0.79) p=0.83] controls. This held true for the postoperative pain scores as well. CONCLUSIONS: Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses."]}
{"question": "Are high flow nasal cannulae noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Noise exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit is believed to be a risk factor for hearing loss in preterm neonates. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices exceed recommended noise levels. High flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are an increasingly popular alternative to CPAP for treating preterm infants, but there are no in vivo studies assessing noise production by HFNC. OBJECTIVE: To study whether HFNC are noisier than bubble CPAP (BCPAP) for preterm infants. METHODS: An observational study of preterm infants receiving HFNC or BCPAP. Noise levels within the external auditory meatus (EAM) were measured using a microphone probe tube connected to a calibrated digital dosimeter. Noise was measured across a range of frequencies and reported as decibels A-weighted (dBA). RESULTS: A total of 21 HFNC and 13 BCPAP noise measurements were performed in 21 infants. HFNC gas flows were 2-5 L/min, and BCPAP gas flows were 6-10 L/min with set pressures of 5-7 cm of water. There was no evidence of a difference in average noise levels measured at the EAM: mean difference (95% CI) of -1.6 (-4.0 to 0.9) dBA for HFNC compared to BCPAP. At low frequency (500 Hz), HFNC was mean (95% CI) 3.0 (0.3 to 5.7) dBA quieter than BCPAP. Noise increased with increasing BCPAP gas flow (p=0.007), but not with increasing set pressure. There was a trend to noise increasing with increasing HFNC gas flows. CONCLUSIONS: At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants."]}
{"question": "Antiretroviral therapy related adverse effects: Can sub-Saharan Africa cope with the new \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation results in significant HIV transmission reduction. This is the rationale behind the \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO). Implementation of this policy will lead to an increased incidence of ART-related adverse effects, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Is the region yet ready to cope with such a challenging issue? MAIN BODY: The introduction and widespread use of ART have drastically changed the natural history of HIV/AIDS, but exposure to ART leads to serious medication-related adverse effects mainly explained by mitochondrial toxicities, and the situation will get worse in the near future. Indeed, ART is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, prediabetes and overt diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis. The prevalence of these disorders is already high in SSA, and the situation will be exacerbated by the implementation of the new WHO recommendations. Most SSA countries are characterized by (extreme) poverty, very weak health systems, inadequate and low quality of health services, inaccessibility to existing health facilities, lack of (qualified) health personnel, lack of adequate equipment, inaccessibility and unaffordability of medicines, and heavy workload in a context of a double burden of disease. Additionally, there is dearth of data on the incidence and predictive factors of ART-related adverse effects in SSA, to anticipate on strategies that should be put in place to prevent the occurrence of these conditions or properly estimate the upcoming burden and prepare an adequate response plan. These are required if we are to anticipate and effectively prevent this upcoming burden. CONCLUSION: While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy."]}
{"question": "Are the elderly with oropharyngeal carcinoma undertreated?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine if elderly patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are receiving less treatment and to evaluate the benefit of aggressive therapy in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a large population database. METHODS: Patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database with OPSCC diagnosed from 2004 to 2009 were included. The patients were categorized into age groups 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 years and older, then further categorized by treatment status. Kaplan-Meier analysis of disease-specific survival (DSS) for late-stage (III and IV) OPSCC was performed for all age and treatment categories, followed by a multivariate cox regression of treatment status, tumor site, race, stage, and sex per age group. RESULTS: A total of 14,909 patients with OPSCC were identified. In our demographic data, we observed a significant increase in the number of patients who did not receive treatment (surgery, radiation, or combined therapy) after age 55. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that age groups 65 to 74 and 75 to 84 had substantial benefits in DSS with surgery, radiation, or combined therapy. Multivariable analysis did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in the hazard ratios for combined treatment among age groups 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84. CONCLUSIONS: Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "BACKGROUND: A remarkably better prognosis is associated with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) driven by human papillomaviruses (HPV) compared with HPV-negative OPSCC. Consequently, de-escalation of standard treatment has been suggested. Due to modest specificity rates, debates are ongoing, whether p16(INK4a), a surrogate marker for HPV-driven OPSCC, is sufficient to correctly identify those tumours and avoid substantial HPV misattribution and thus undertreatment of patients by de-escalation. Robust data estimating the proportion of potentially undertreated patients are missing. METHODS: We assessed a large-scale cohort of consecutively included OPSCC diagnosed between 2000 and 2017 for HPV-DNA, HPV genotypes, p16(INK4a) expression and multiple tumour- and patient-related risk factors, and investigated their impact on patients' survival in comprehensive uni- and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Aetiological relevance of HPV (p16(INK4a)- and high-risk HPV-DNA-positivity) was detected in 27.1% (n = 192) of OPSCC, with HPV(16) being the most abundant HPV type (94.6%). In 5.5% patients (n = 39), p16(INK4a) overexpression but no HPV-DNA was detected. Principal component and survival analyses revealed that 60.6% of these p16(INK4a)-positive OPSCC lacking HPV-DNA did not resemble HPV(16)-driven but HPV-negative OPSCC regarding risk-factor profile and overall survival. Notably, this group represented 10.6% of all p16(INK4a)-overexpressing OPSCC. CONCLUSIONS: p16(INK4a) as a single marker appears insufficient to indicate OPSCC patients suitable for treatment de-escalation."]}
{"question": "Preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. Does PET/CT really add something to multidetector CT?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine prospectively whether the systematic use of PET/CT associated with conventional techniques could improve the accuracy of staging in patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. We also assessed the impact on the therapeutic strategy. METHODS: Between 2006 and 2008, 97 patients who were evaluated for resection of LMCRC were prospectively enrolled. Preoperative workup included multidetector-CT (MDCT) and PET/CT. In 11 patients with liver steatosis or iodinated contrast allergy, MR also was performed. Sixty-eight patients underwent laparotomy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values for hepatic and extrahepatic staging of MDCT and PET-CT were calculated. RESULTS: In a lesion-by-lesion analysis of the hepatic staging, the sensitivity of MDCT/RM was superior to PET/CT (89.2 vs. 55%, p < 0.001). On the extrahepatic staging, PET/CT was superior to MDCT/MR only for the detection of locoregional recurrence (p = 0.03) and recurrence in uncommon sites (p = 0.016). New findings in PET/CT resulted in a change in therapeutic strategy in 17 patients. However, additional information was correct only in eight cases and wrong in nine patients. CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT has a limited role in hepatic staging of LMCRC. Although PET-CT has higher sensitivity for the detection of extrahepatic disease in some anatomic locations, its results are hampered by its low PPV. PET/CT provided additional useful information in 8% of the cases but also incorrect and potentially harmful data in 9% of the staging. Our findings support a more selective use of PET/CT, basically in patients with high risk of local recurrence."]}
{"question": "Can myometrial electrical activity identify patients in preterm labor?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether myometrial electrical activity can differentiate false from true preterm labor. STUDY DESIGN: Electrical uterine myography (EUM) was measured prospectively on 87 women, gestational age less than 35 weeks. The period between contractions, power of contraction peaks and movement of center of electrical activity (RMS), was used to develop an index score (1-5) for prediction of preterm delivery (PTD) within 14 days of the test. The score was compared with fetal fibronectin (fFN) and cervical length (CL). RESULTS: Patients delivering within 14 days from testing showed a higher index and mean RMS (P = .000). No patients with EUM index scores of 1-2 delivered in this time frame. Combining EUM with CL or fFN increased predictability. Logistic regression revealed that history of PTD and EUM index had 4- to 5-fold increased risk for PTD. Gestational age at testing, body mass index, fFN, and CL were nonsignificant contributors to PTD risk. CONCLUSION: Measuring myometrial electrical activity may enhance identification of patients in true premature labor.", "The bioelectrical signals that produce uterine contractions during parturition are not completely understood. The objectives are as follows: (1) to review the literature and information concerning uterine biopotential waveforms generated by the uterus, known to produce contractions, and evaluate mechanotransduction in pregnant patients using electromyographic (EMG) recording methods and (2) to study a new approach, uterine vector analysis, commonly used for the heart: vectorcardiography analysis. The patients used in this study were as follows: (1) patients at term not in labor (n = 3); (2) patients during the 1st stage of labor at cervical dilations from 2 to 10 cm (n = 30); and (3) patients in the 2nd stage of labor and during delivery (n = 3). We used DC-coupled electrodes and PowerLab hardware (model no. PL2604, ADInstruments, Castle Hill, Australia), with software (LabChart, ADInstruments) for storage and analysis of biopotentials. Uterine and abdominal EMG recordings were made from the surface of each patient using 3 electrode pairs with 1 pair (+ and -, with a 31-cm spacing distance) placed in the right/left position (X position) and with 1 pair placed in an up/down position (Y position, also 31 cm apart) and with the third pair at the front/back (Z position). Using signals from the three X, Y, and Z electrodes, slow (0.03 to 0.1 Hz, high amplitude) and fast wave (0.3 to 1 Hz, low amplitude) biopotentials were recorded. The amplitudes of the slow waves and fast waves were significantly higher during the 2nd stage of labor compared to the 1st stage (respectively, p = 9.54 x e(-3) and p = 3.94 x e(-7)). When 2 channels were used, for example, the X vs. Y, for 2-D vector analysis or 3 channels, X vs. Y vs. Z, for 3-D analysis, are plotted against each other on their axes, this produces a vector electromyometriogram (EMMG) that shows no directionality for fast waves and a downward direction for slow waves. Similarly, during the 2nd stage of labor during abdominal contractions (\"pushing\"), the slow and fast waves were enlarged. Manual applied pressure was used to evoke bioelectrical activity to examine the mechanosensitivity of the uterus. Conclusions: (1) Phasic contractility of the uterus is a product of slow waves and groups of fast waves (bursts of spikes) to produce myometrial contractile responses. (2) 2-D and 3-D uterine vector analyses (uterine vector electromyometriogram) demonstrate no directionality of small fast waves while the larger slow waves represent the downward direction of biopotentials towards the cervical opening. (3) Myometrial cell action event excitability and subsequent contractility likely amplify slow wave activity input and uterine muscle contractility via mechanotransduction systems. (4) Models illustrate the possible relationships of slow to fast waves and the association of a mechanotransduction system and pacemaker activity as observed for slow waves and pacemakers in gastrointestinal muscle. (5) The interaction of these systems is thought to regulate uterine contractility. (6) This study suggests a potential indicator of delivery time. Such vector approaches might help us predict the progress of gestation and better estimate the timing of delivery, gestational pathologies reflected in bioelectric events, and perhaps the potential for premature delivery drug and mechanical interventions.", "OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of labor is currently one of the most difficult problems encountered by obstetrical healthcare providers. A major health problem is the increase in the rate of preterm delivery, which is responsible for 75% of all deaths in newborns. In addition, preterm delivery is associated with several cognitive and health problems in later life and enormous costs for the health system. A better understanding of myometrial activities could help to reduce preterm deliveries and the costs associated with prematurity in the following years. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to analyze the uterine contraction data would help us gain a better insight of the myometrial activities of the human uterus during pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Uterine magnetomyographic (MMG) signals were recorded from pregnant patients at gestational ages of 32-38 weeks. The study was approved by the Human Research Advisory Board of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and performed after obtaining written consent from each patient. The recording of transabdominal MMG signals was conducted with the SQUID Array for Reproductive Assessment (SARA, VSM MedTech Inc; Coquitlam, BC, Canada) system, which has 151 primary magnetic sensors allocated approximately 3 cm apart over an area of 850 cm(2). The arrangement of sensors is concave in nature and, in a similar lateral distance, spans the maternal abdomen longitudinally from the symphysis pubis to the uterine fundus. The recording times ranged from 12 to 28 min, and the sampling rate was 250 Hz. The data were down-sampled to 25 Hz to reduce the computational complexity and post-processed with a bandpass filter (0.05-1 Hz) because the uterine contraction activity is a band-limited process (0.05-1 Hz). The recordings of one intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC) dataset and two mother-perceived contraction datasets were compared with the HHT results, and HHT's potential was explored through the development of a module and a series of experiments. The local energy and the instantaneous frequency derived from the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) through HHT provide a full energy-frequency-time distribution of the data. Our objective was to determine whether HHT for each channel can help identify and localize contractions in the uterus. Human studies have been reviewed by the appropriate ethics committee and have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards described in an appropriate version of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2000. RESULTS: After comparing the IUPC and other mother-perceived contraction (STIM) datasets with HHT results, we were able to visually detect contraction locations in the HHT-processed uterine signals. For verification and validation purposes, when we further analyzed the delay time between two signals, the mechanical activity (i.e., IUPC) following the electrical activity (i.e., magnetic signal) was observed. In conclusion, our experimentations using the method introduced here revealed that there is a 75% correlation between the results obtained by HHT and IUPC data. CONCLUSION: This study compared uterine contractions and changes in the intrauterine pressure with results obtained by HHT. In addition, using IUPC data as a validation guide, we showed that the HHT approach can be used for noise removal. There is a need for time-saving and non-subjective automatic contraction detection in the field of prenatal examination."]}
{"question": "Schizophrenia patients with high intelligence: A clinically distinct sub-type of schizophrenia?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia patients are typically found to have low IQ both pre- and post-onset, in comparison to the general population. However, a subgroup of patients displays above average IQ pre-onset. The nature of these patients' illness and its relationship to typical schizophrenia is not well understood. The current study sought to investigate the symptom profile of high-IQ schizophrenia patients. METHODS: We identified 29 schizophrenia patients of exceptionally high pre-morbid intelligence (mean estimated pre-morbid intelligence quotient (IQ) of 120), of whom around half also showed minimal decline (less than 10 IQ points) from their estimated pre-morbid IQ. We compared their symptom scores (SAPS, SANS, OPCRIT, MADRS, GAF, SAI-E) with a comparison group of schizophrenia patients of typical IQ using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: The patients with very high pre-morbid IQ had significantly lower scores on negative and disorganised symptoms than typical patients (RRR=0.019; 95% CI=0.001, 0.675, P=0.030), and showed better global functioning and insight (RRR=1.082; 95% CI=1.020, 1.148; P=0.009). Those with a minimal post-onset IQ decline also showed higher levels of manic symptoms (RRR=8.213; 95% CI=1.042, 64.750, P=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories."]}
{"question": "Is nasogastric decompression useful in prevention of leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: Although its excellent results, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) presents major complications ranging from 0% to 29%. Among them, the staple line leak presents an incidence varying from 0% to 7%. Many trials debated about different solutions in order to reduce leaks' incidence. No author has investigated the role of gastric decompression in the prevention of this complication. Aim of our work is to evaluate if this procedure can play a role in avoiding the occurrence of staple line leaks after LSG. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2008 and November 2012, 145 patients were prospectively and randomly included in the study. Seventy patients composed the group A, whose operations were completed with placement of nasogastric tube; the other 75 patients were included in the group B, in which no nasogastric tube was placed. RESULTS: No statistical differences were observed between group A and group B regarding gender distribution, age, weight, and BMI. No intraoperative complications and no conversion occurred in both groups. Intraoperative blood loss (50.1 +/- 42.3 vs. 52.5 +/- 37.6 ml, respectively) and operative time (65.4 +/- 25.5 vs. 62.6 +/- 27.8 min, respectively) were comparable between the two groups (p: NS). One staple line leak (1.4%) occurred on 6th postoperative day in group A patients. No leak was observed in group B patients. Postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in group A vs. group B patients (7.6 +/- 3.4 vs. 6.2 +/- 3.1 days, respectively, p: 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence."]}
{"question": "Does open access endoscopy close the door to an adequately informed patient?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: In traditional access endoscopy (TAE), patients are booked for endoscopy following a gastroenterology clinic assessment. In contrast, open access endoscopy (OAE) patients are seen for the first time on the day of the procedure, providing same day procedural consent. Controversy exists over the use of OAE in adults, both with the consent process and with patient satisfaction. No literature exists describing satisfaction with OAE in pediatrics. We therefore aimed to assess pediatric patient and caregiver satisfaction in OAE compared with TAE. METHODS: Consecutive pediatric patients, and their caregivers, undergoing elective upper endoscopy from May to December 2012 at the Stollery Children's Hospital (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) were consented for a cross-sectional survey. Seven preprocedure and 5 postprocedure questions were completed regarding mood and satisfaction with the wait time and the information provided. Group demographics and endoscopy wait times were collected. RESULTS: Median wait time with OAE was less compared with TAE (57 days vs 196 days, P < 0.001). OAE patients reported worse mood preprocedure than TAE patients (35.3% vs 10.7%, P = 0.046). OAE caregivers and patients reported more mood disturbance if required to wait longer for endoscopy by attending clinic preprocedure (OAE caregivers 62.2%, OAE patients 64.7%). CONCLUSIONS: OAE is associated with worse preendoscopy patient mood; however, children and caregivers seem concerned about longer wait times associated with TAE. Given the significantly shorter wait times in OAE, identifying methods to minimize present limitations of OAE will be useful to improve clinical practices in pediatric gastroenterology.", "Patient knowledge about lower endoscopy might have beneficial effects on satisfaction outcomes, pre-procedure anxiety, and adherence, although this is poorly understood. Methods Searching the national and international literature, we reviewed 20 years of observational studies and randomized trials that examine possible relationships between educating patients about lower endoscopy and clinical outcomes. Twenty-three publications were included but their heterogeneity precluded meta-analyses. Standard and modified informed consent procedures and enhanced educational interventions were associated most often with levels of patient knowledge, satisfaction, anxiety, and adherence. Regardless of the approach, a large proportion of patients have poor comprehension of lower endoscopy's risks, benefits, and alternatives; patient satisfaction with information and procedures manifests ceiling effects; only a subset of patients have clinically significant pre-procedure anxiety; and providing written information and reminders may improve procedure adherence. Future work should focus on strategies for improving patient knowledge in the setting of initial screening colonoscopy within open access systems. Patient knowledge of lower endoscopy is often inadequate even though greater knowledge might be associated with better clinical outcomes for certain patient subgroups. Professional societies have an important role to play in endorsing educational strategies and in clarifying and assessing the adequacy of patient knowledge.", "BACKGROUND: The growing demand for endoscopy associated with colorectal cancer screening has resulted in busier endoscopy units and an increase in the practice of open-access endoscopy, in which patients are referred for procedures without prior consultation by the gastroenterologist, all of which may result in less-informed patients. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether providing patients with a written copy of their standard endoscopy report at the conclusion of their procedure enhanced recall of the findings and recommendations. DESIGN: Eighty consecutive outpatients who presented to 3 endoscopists were randomized to receive the results of their upper or lower endoscopy via standard verbal report (VR) or by standard VR followed by receipt of a computer-generated endoscopy report (VR+WR) from the Olympus ImageManager report generator. The endoscopist communicated the VR after a standard postprocedure recovery period of 30 to 60 minutes and routinely discussed all findings and recommendations as mentioned in the WR. The endoscopist was blinded as to whether the patient subsequently received the WR. Recall of the endoscopic procedure was assessed by using a piloted 11-question survey instrument to be filled out 3 days after the procedure. Results were calculated by using the Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. PATIENTS: Referral for endoscopy from University of Chicago physicians. RESULTS: Seventy-eight of 80 patients (98%) approached about the study agreed to participate. The response rate was 77%. Patients in the VR+WR group overall had a greater composite score than patients in the VR group (8.9/10 vs 7.7/10, P<.01). Patients in the VR+WR group were also significantly more likely to recall the recommendations for therapy or follow-up (72% vs 42%, P<.01) and the name of the endoscopist (97% vs 74%, P<.05). LIMITATIONS: Patients with an education beyond the 10th-grade level were not formally accessed in this study. Because of this, we could not evaluate whether differences in educational attainment affected patient understanding of endoscopy procedure details and findings. CONCLUSIONS: A computer-generated endoscopy report (WR) significantly improved patient recall of endoscopic procedure information compared with a VR alone. Despite this, patients were unable to recall 28% of recommendations. Additional study to determine if such enhanced physician-patient communication improves patient satisfaction or follow-up, and whether more specific patient-directed results further improve recall needs to occur.", "IMPORTANCE: Diagnostic yield of upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract endoscopy for uninvestigated dyspepsia is low, and its clinical implications are limited. There is an unmet need for better strategies to reduce the volume of upper GI tract endoscopic procedures for dyspepsia. OBJECTIVE: To study the effectiveness of a web-based educational intervention as a tool to reduce upper GI tract endoscopy in uninvestigated dyspepsia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial enrolled participants between November 1, 2017, and March 31, 2019, with follow-up 52 weeks after randomization, at 4 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants included patients with uninvestigated dyspeptic symptoms who were referred for upper GI tract endoscopy by their general health care clinician without prior consultation of a gastroenterologist. A total of 119 patients, aged 18 to 69 years, were included. Patients were excluded if any of the following red flag symptoms were present: (indirect) signs of upper GI tract hemorrhage (hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or anemia), unintentional weight loss of 5% or higher of normal body weight during a period of 6 to 12 months, persistent vomiting, dysphagia, or jaundice. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to education (intervention) or upper GI tract endoscopy (control). Education consisted of a self-managed web-based educational intervention, containing information on gastric function, dyspepsia, and upper GI tract endoscopy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Difference in the proportion of upper GI tract endoscopy procedures between those who received access to the web-based educational intervention and those who did not at 12 weeks and 52 weeks after randomization, analyzed in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary outcomes included quality of life (Nepean Dyspepsia Index) and symptom severity (Patient Assessment of Gastrointestinal Disorders Symptom Severity Index) measured at baseline and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Of 119 patients included (median age, 48 years [interquartile range, 37-56 years]; 48 men [40%]), 62 were randomized to web-based education (intervention) and 57 to upper GI tract endoscopy (control). Significantly fewer patients compared with controls underwent upper GI tract endoscopy after using the web-based educational intervention: 24 (39%) vs 47 (82%) (relative risk, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.33-0.64; P < .001). Symptom severity and quality of life improved equivalently in both groups. One additional patient in the intervention group required upper GI tract endoscopy during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings of this study indicate that web-based patient education is an effective tool to decrease the need for upper GI tract endoscopy in uninvestigated dyspepsia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03205319.", "OAE is commonly used. The majority of patients referred for OAE are considered appropriate for endoscopy according to ASGE guidelines. Most patients undergoing OAE procedures are knowledgeable about the study and are satisfied with the experience. Several potential problems have been identified, including inappropriate referrals, communication errors, and inadequately prepared or informed patients. OAE can be safely used if preprocedure assessment, informed consent, information transfer, patient safety, and satisfaction are addressed in all cases."]}
{"question": "Is hypoalbuminemia an independent prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Studies have indicated that hypoalbuminemia is associated with decreased survival of patients with gastric cancer. However, the prognostic value of albumin may be secondary to an ongoing systemic inflammatory response. The aim of the study was to assess the relation between hypoalbuminemia, the systemic inflammatory response, and survival in patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with gastric carcinoma attending the upper gastrointestinal surgical unit in the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow between April 1997 and December 2005 and who had a pretreatment measurement of albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were studied. RESULTS: Most of the patients had stage III/IV disease and received palliative treatment. The minimum follow-up was 15 months. During follow-up, 157 (72%) patients died of their cancer. On univariate analysis, stage (p < 0.001), treatment (p < 0.001), albumin level (p < 0.001), and CRP level (p < 0.001) were significant predictors of survival. On multivariate analysis, stage (p < 0.001), treatment (p < 0.001), and CRP level (p < 0.001) remained significant predictors of survival. Albumin was no longer an independent predictor of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Low albumin concentrations are associated with poorer survival in patients with gastric cancer. However, the strength of this relation with survival is dependent on the presence of a systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by an elevated CRP level. Therefore, it appears that the relation between hypoalbuminemia and poor survival is secondary to that of the systemic inflammatory response.", "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of preoperative serum albumin in patients with gastric cancer undergoing radical resection. METHODS: A total of 146 patients with gastric cancer underwent radical resection from January 2001 to December 2003. Clinicopathological data were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into two groups, including patients with a normal preoperative serum albumin level(>35 g/L, n=115) and patients with hypoalbuminemia (</=35 g/L, n=31). RESULTS: Patients with a low albumin level were associated with a higher postoperative recurrence rate(90.3% vs. 43.5%, P<0.01). The overall 5-year survival rate in patients with a normal serum albumin level was significantly higher than that in patients with a low serum level(57.4% vs. 9.7%, P<0.01). On multivariate analysis, preoperative serum albumin level was an independent factor associated with survival(P<0.01). When stratified by nodal metastasis, normal serum albumin level was still associated with higher survival rate(P<0.05). Prognostic significance was found in patients with lower stomach cancer(P<0.01), but not in patients with cancer in the upper and middle stomach(P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Hypoalbuminemia is associated with worse survival in patients with cancer in the lower stomach and adjuvant therapy should be considered.", "Among patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia, we noted that patients with higher preoperative serum albumin levels appeared to survive longer than patients with lower levels. Thus, we evaluated serum albumin as a prognostic factor for patient survival. From 1987 to 1997, 314 patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia underwent curative resection. Patient serum albumin levels were evaluated on the second day after admission, before any nutritional support. Patients were divided into two groups: those with normal serum albumin levels (>3.5 g/dl) and those with abnormal serum albumin levels. The perioperative mortality and morbidity were 5.7% (18 of 314) and 22.3% (70 of 314), respectively. The surgical resectability rate was significantly better among patients with normal serum albumin levels (P < 0.001). The 5-year overall survival rate of patients with normal serum albumin levels was also better than those with abnormally low serum albumin levels (38.4% versus 19.1%, P=0.0003). In each cancer stage, the 5-year survival rate of patients with normal serum albumin levels was better than that among those with hypoalbuminemia. By multivariate analysis, serum albumin level and the pathologic T, N statuses were independent factors correlated with prognosis. Preoperative serum albumin level correlated highly with resectability and survival. Patients with abnormal serum albumin levels had worse survival than did those with normal serum albumin levels. We recommend that postoperative adjuvant therapy be given to all patients with hypoalbuminemia preoperatively.", "BACKGROUND: Peritoneal lavage cytology cancer-positive (CY1) is a critical prognostic factor and is taken as representing stage IV in gastric cancer. There is no consensus treatment strategy for CY1-gastric cancer, and the detailed clinicopathological features remain obscure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 790 gastric cancer patients between 2005 and 2009, 52 cases of CY1 were identified (6.6%). A multivariate prognostic model was applied to the univariate prognostic factors to identify independent prognostic factors and factors associated with long-term survival in CY1-gastric cancer. RESULTS: (1) Five-year overall survival (OS) was 17.6% in CY1-gastric cancer as compared with 93.9% in CYX and 77.7% in CY0 (77.7%), where tumors with pT2 or beyond were included in 11% of CYX, 73% of CY0, and 98% of CY1 cases. (2) On univariate analysis, factors associated with a negative prognosis were the presence of peritoneal dissemination (p = 0.029) and high preoperative serum albumin (p = 0.011) in CY1-gastric cancer. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression model using propensity score identified preoperative albumin as a critical independent prognostic indicator. (3) Long-term survivors were identified and, were often characterized by long-term postoperative adjuvant treatment. CONCLUSION: Reduced preoperative serum albumin and absence of peritoneal dissemination may be predictive factors for long-term survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer with positive cytology test. Long-term postoperative adjuvant therapy might improve survival of patients with CY1.", "BACKGROUND: The influence of pretreatment anemia on the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) remains controversial. We retrospectively examined the impact of pretreatment anemia on the overall survival (OS) of patients with GC with nonhypoalbuminemia undergoing curative resection. METHODS: The clinicopathological data of 2,916 patients with advanced GC who received a radical gastrectomy from 1994 to 2015 were analyzed. The patients were divided into two subgroups by hemoglobin level, <120 and >/=120 g/L. OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify the independent prognostic factor. RESULTS: A total of 1,099 patients were included in our study. The median follow-up duration was 43 (IQR, 24-66) months. The prevalence of anemia was 40.9%. Among these 1,099 patients, 505 (46.0%) had nonhypoalbuminemia. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with GC who were anemic had a poorer OS than patients who were not (5-year OS rate: 58.4% vs. 66.8%, P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that pretreatment anemia was an independent prognostic factor [hazard ratio (HR) =1.455, 95% CI, 1.013-2.09; P=0.043]. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that pretreatment anemia may serve as an independent prognostic factor for patients with advanced GC with nonhypoalbuminemia after radical gastrectomy, especially those with larger tumor size and pT3 disease."]}
{"question": "Can the postoperative pain level be predicted preoperatively?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: This study was a prospective investigation of the extent to which psychologic variables could be predictive of postoperative pain. Study aims were: 1) to evaluate whether an assessment of pre-operative distress factors could predict the intensity of postoperative pain; and 2) to characterize the unique pattern in which anxiety and pain catastrophizing scores relate to postoperative pain. METHODS: The Pain Catastrophizing Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were administered to 38 patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery. The questionnaires were completed on the day of admission, a day before the operation. On day 1 and day 2 following the operation, perception of pain intensity at the surgical wound was assessed by visual analog scale. RESULTS: The Pain Catastrophizing Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores were significantly correlated with the postoperative pain scores. A linear regression analysis showed that Pain Catastrophizing Scale predicted the level of postoperative pain intensity even after controlling for state anxiety and that trait anxiety was not a significant predictor. In addition, analysis of the unique pattern of each predictor related to postoperative pain intensity indicated a linear curve for the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and curvilinear curve for the state anxiety. DISCUSSION: The results are discussed in light of appraisal and coping theories. It is suggested that a simple assessment of preoperative catastrophizing tendency and anxiety scores may assist medical teams in postoperative pain management.", "BACKGROUND: It has previously been reported that venous cannulation-induced pain (VCP) can be used to predict acute postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients rating VCP at >/=2.0 VAS units had 3.4 times higher risk for moderate or severe pain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if VCP scores of >/=2.0 VAS units are associated with higher risk for acute postoperative pain after various common surgical procedures. METHODS: In a prospective clinical observational study, 600 male and female 18- to 80-year-old patients scheduled for elective surgery were included. The primary outcome measure was the difference in maximum postoperative pain intensity between low responders (VCP < 2.0) and high responders (VCP >/= 2.0) to VCP. Secondary outcome measures were the difference in proportion of patients with moderate or severe postoperative pain between low and high responders, and potential influence of age, gender, and preoperative habitual pain. RESULTS: Patients scoring VCP >/=2.0 VAS units reported higher acute postoperative pain intensity levels than those scoring VCP <2.0 VAS units (median 3.0 [interquartile range 0.0 to 5.0] vs. 0.2 [interquartile range 0.0 to 4.0], P = 0.001), and also had 1.7 times higher risk for moderate or severe postoperative pain (P = 0.005). Moderate or severe postoperative pain was reported by 38% of patients with VCP scores of >/=2.0 VAS units and by 26% with VCP scores of <2.0 VAS units (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Scoring of VCP intensity before surgery, requiring no specific equipment or training, is useful to predict individual risks for moderate or severe postoperative pain, regardless of patient age or gender, in a setting involving different kinds of surgery.", "BACKGROUND CONTENT: The goal of postoperative pain management is to facilitate the patient's return to normal activity and decrease the detrimental effects of acute postsurgical pain. In order to provide more tailored and successful pain treatment, it is necessary to identify individuals who are at a high risk of experiencing severe postoperative pain. The most precise way to assess pain sensitivity is by determining the pressure pain threshold and heat pain threshold by objective methods using a digital algometer and neurotouch respectively. PURPOSE: The primary aim of the study is to assess the preoperative pain threshold and its influence on postoperative pain severity and analgesics requirements in patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgeries. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Sixty patients requiring a single-level lumbar fusion surgery. OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative pain intensity and the amount of postoperative analgesics consumption. METHODS: In our patients, preoperative pain sensitivity was assessed by pressure pain threshold measurements with the help of a digital algometer, and heat pain threshold using a neurotouch instrument. In addition, pain sensitivity questionnaires (PSQ) were used in all our patients to determine pain sensitivity. Preoperative psychosocial and functional assessments were performed by Hospital anxiety-depression scores (HADS), and Oswestry disability index (ODI) respectively. Preoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score was determined at three instances of needle prick (phlebotomy, glucometer blood sugar, and intradermal antibiotic test dose) and during the range of movements of the lumbar spine region. Postoperative VAS score and postoperative breakthrough analgesic requirements were recorded in all of these patients from day 0 to day 3. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 51.11+/-13.467 years and 70% were females. Females had lower mean algometry values (72.14+/-7.56) compared to males (77.34+/-6.33). Patients with higher HADS (p<.0016), higher PSQ (p<.001), higher ODI scores(p<.001), and female gender significantly correlated with a lower algometer average indicating high pain sensitivity. Patients with lower preoperative VAS scores and with higher neurotouch scores showed lower postoperative VAS scores at different time periods. Preoperative VAS scores, algometer average scores, neurotouch scores, and HADS scores were considered as independent variables (predictors) for postoperative VAS at 6 hours period. By the multivariate analysis, factors like preoperative VAS scores, algometer average scores, and HADS scores were statistically significant (p<.05). There was a significant correlation between algometer average scores (p<.001) with the breakthrough analgesics. CONCLUSION: Preoperative assessment of pain sensitivity can predict postoperative analgesic requirements and aid in recovery. Patients with a lower pain threshold should be counseled preoperatively and also receive a better titration of analgesics perioperatively.", "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: We searched for factors present preoperatively which could be used to predict the intensity of postoperative pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We undertook a prospective study among all patients aged over 18 years who underwent shoulder surgery from January to September 2004 in our unit. The study included 86 patients for which the following data were noted preoperatively: past history of pain, intensity and duration of prior pain, triggering factors, localization, psychological context. The intensity of the postoperative pain was measured on a visual analog scale (VAS); measurements were noted up to 24 hours postop then at one month. Data processing was performed with Statview5.5. RESULTS: Significant postoperative pain was correlated with a prior history of surgical pain, with duration of prior pain, with intensity of preoperative pain, and with depression. DISCUSSION: Significant sustained preoperative pain can favor memory of pain leading to postoperative sensitivization of nociception neurons. Intense postoperative pain can favor the development of refractory chronic pain. CONCLUSION: Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.", "OBJECTIVE: Postoperative pain is associated with delayed discharged and recovery, reduced patient satisfaction, and increased costs. The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term association between preoperative psychological variables (pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression) and postoperative pain in a sample of cardiac surgery patients. DESIGN: This is a prospective epidemiological study. SETTING: This study was carried out at two Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service Trust Hospitals (St. Mary's Hospital and Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK). SUBJECTS: Sixty-four cardiac surgery patients completed the \"pain catastrophizing scale (PCS),\" the \"hospital anxiety and depression scale,\" and the \"verbal rating scale\" (VRS) for pain intensity preoperatively and at 48 hours postoperatively. Analgesia consumption was recorded. Data on demographic, operative, and clinical characteristics were obtained from medical records. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain intensity at 48 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: Scores on the anxiety, depression, and PCSs were not significantly different between the pre- and postoperative period. In contrast, patients reported a higher level of pain intensity postoperatively (P < 0.001). In the fully adjusted multiple regression analysis, postoperative pain intensity was predicted by a higher level of preoperative pain intensity (dichotomized above median; beta = 2.00, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28-3.72) and a higher score on the preoperative PCS (dichotomized above median; beta = 1.87, 95% CI: 0.53-3.21). CONCLUSIONS: Pain catastrophizing can predict postoperative pain intensity in cardiac surgery patients, independently of the presence of anxiety, depression, or preoperative level of pain. Future studies should aim to establish the role of pain catastrophizing in longer-term outcomes in cardiac surgery."]}
{"question": "Is primary angioplasty an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis?", "retrieved_passages": ["The availability and the now routine use of thrombolytic agents are important advances for therapeutic cardiology and the emergency care of patients experiencing AMI. The progression from ischemia to necrosis of cardiac muscle now can be aborted in a portion of this population by initiating thrombolytic infusions. Early use of thrombolysis in these patients has reduced acute myocardial infarction mortality and morbidity significantly. Although thrombolytic therapy has changed the course of treatment and survival after AMI, there may be time when this approach is contraindicated or unsuccessful. Alternative treatments that may be considered when thrombolytic agents cannot be given, or fail to ameliorate ischemia, are emergent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Future interventional procedures such as intracoronary stents, atherectomy devices, and lasers may be considered as emergent treatment in the near future. It is important to have reviewed when these alternative invasive procedures, some of which are currently experimental, might be considered. Indeed, interventional procedures such as intracoronary stents, atherectomy devices, and laser delivery systems eventually may be accepted as primary therapies for the patient who arrives in the emergency department with an AMI. In the meantime, thrombolytic therapy administered as urgently as possible to appropriate patients with myocardial infarction is the most important goal.", "OBJECTIVE: The National Infarct Angioplasty Project assessed the feasibility of establishing a comprehensive primary angioplasty service. We aimed to compare satisfaction at intervention hospitals offering angioplasty-based care and control hospitals offering thrombolysis-based care. DESIGN: Mixed methods, with postal survey of patients and their carers, supported by semi-structured interviews. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Survey of 682 patients and 486 carers, and interviews with 33 patients and carers, in eight English hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: Primary angioplasty or thrombolysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: Responses were received from 595/682 patients (87%) and 418/486 carers (86%). Satisfaction with overall care was high at both intervention and control sites (78% vs. 71% patients rated their care as 'excellent', P = 0.074). Patient satisfaction was higher at intervention sites for some aspects of care such as speed of treatment (80% vs. 67%'excellent', P = 0.001). Convenience of visiting was rated lower at intervention sites by carers (12% vs. 1%'poor', P = 0.001). During interviews, carers reported that they accepted the added inconvenience of visiting primary angioplasty sites in the context of this life-saving treatment. Patient satisfaction with discharge and aftercare was lower in both treatment groups than for other aspects of care. CONCLUSIONS: Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "Systemic thrombolysis and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are both effective treatments for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Several randomized trials have shown that primary PCI is superior to thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Despite these findings, thrombolytic therapy remains an acceptable alternative for most patients, yet it may not be ideal for higher-risk AMI patients. Advanced age, diabetes mellitus, anterior infarction, severe tachycardia, shock and comorbidities are associated with early mortality rates ranging from 10 to 58% in patients treated with thrombolytic agents. This review will examine the data comparing primary PCI and systemic thrombolysis in the different clinical conditions which identify patients at high risk in the setting of AMI.", "BACKGROUND: Percutaneous angioplasty is an alternative to thrombolysis to reestablish coronary blood flow in patients with transmural myocardial infarction. At present, this treatment option is not widely accepted in Norway. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1996 to 1998, one hundred consecutive patients were treated with angioplasty for acute transmural infarction. The angiography showed one-vessel disease in 55%, two-vessel in 25%, and multivessel in 20%. The infarct related artery was the LAD in 44%, the CX in 14%, the RCA in 41%, and bypass graft in one. 92% had TIMI 0 or 1 flow. Stent was placed in 73%, GPIIb/IIIa was used in 11% and temporary pacemaker placed in 5%. RESULTS: Successful angioplasty was performed in 95%, 3% was not done, and 2% failed. Peripheral stenoses were treated in 15% and stenoses in other arteries in 10%. Complications and events within 24 hours related to the angioplasty were seen in 9%. CONCLUSION: Primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction can be done with high primary success, good short-term results and few complications.", "Direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (d-PTCA) in patients with acute myocardial infarctions (AIM) has become an alternative of thrombolytic treatment. If the involved department has adequate experience the success rate of the procedure is high and the immediate and long-term results are better than those of thrombolysis. Moreover contrary to thrombolytic treatment successful percutaneous coronary intervention in AIM is more beneficial for patients also later than 6 hours after the development of infarction pain. In the Cardiocentre of the General Faculty Hospital (GFH) patients with AIM are constantly attended, i.e. those indicated for reperfusion therapy are treated solely by the d-PTCA method. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: Retrospective analysis of d-PTCA in AIM made during the annual period from Jan. 1 2000 to Dec. 31 2000. Into the observation study patients were included with clinical and/or ECG signs of AIM when the period from the onset of pain to the beginning of intervention did not exceed 12 hours. All patients were given before the procedures 500 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and 10,000 u. heparin. Cardiac catheterization was implemented by the percutaneous Seldinger technique via the a. femoralis l.dx., in exceptional cases from the left femoral artery. An approach via the a. radialis and/or a. brachialis was not used in any of the patients. From the investigation patients were excluded who had before the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) a thrombolytic preparation (so-called rescue-PTCA). RESULTS: During the mentioned period in the Cardiocentre of the GFH a total of 673 PTCA were performed, incl. 127 (18.9%) d-PTCA in patients with AIM. In the mentioned group of 127 patients subjected to intervention were 87 (68.5%) men and 40 (31.5%) women. The mean age of the men was 59.1 +/- 12 years and the mean age of the women 68.2 +/- 12 years. As to the main risk factors of coronary atherosclerosis arterial hypertension was present in 48%, smoking in 42%, diabetes in 23% and hyperlipoproteinaemia in 31% of the treated patients. More than one third of the patients had a history of myocardial infarction (38%). The infarcted artery was the r. interventricularis anterior (LAD) in 51 (40.2%), the right coronary artery (RCA) in 54 (42.5%), the r. circumflex (LCX) in 16 (12.6%), the left main coronary artery in 2 (1.6%) and the bypass in 4 (3.1%). Multiple coronary affections were recorded in 80 (63%) patients, affections of one artery in 47 (37%). Primary procedural success (flow TIMI 3/2) was achieved in 121 patients (95.3%). Normal flow through the infarcted artery TIMI 3 was achieved in 118/127 (85.8%) patients. In 91 (71.7%) into the infarcted artery a coronary stent was implanted, during hospitalization no subacute stenosis of the stent developed. The mean period between the onset of infarction pain--injection was 4.4 +/- 2.3 hours. The mean period of the entire procedures was 48 +/- 14.5 minutes. As contrast material only non-ionic contrast substances were used (Iomeron 350) with a mean consumption of 150 ml per patient. The mean skiascopic time was 13.6 +/- 1.8 min. A total of 9 (7.1%) patients were treated with GP IIb/IIIa receptor blockers (abciximab). The total hospitalization mortality of the intervened group was 7.1% (9 patients). In a sub-group of 9 patients who at the onset of the procedure were in cardiogenic shock 3 (33%) died. The hospitalization mortality of the sub-group of patients with AIM without cardiogenic shock, treated with d-PTCA was 5.1% (6/118). During hospitalization the authors did not observe any intracranial haemorrhage. DISCUSSION: The group of subjects with AIM subjected to catheterization who are treated by d-PTCA is relatively numerous in our department. According to a number of clinical studies successful d-PTCA in AIM gives better short-term and long-term results as compared with thrombolytic therapy. The primary success rate of d-PTCA was high and the hospital mortality was low and comparable with contemporary data in the literature. CONCLUSION: Direct PTCA is effective treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The authors results confirm the high procedural success rate and acceptable hospital mortality. These favourable results of an invasive approach to treatment of AIM must be compared in future with bolus thrombolytic treatment by new types of thrombolytic preparations in combination with anti-platelet treatment with blockers of platelet glycoprotein receptors IIb/IIIa with/or without subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention."]}
{"question": "Should HIV-infected patients be screened for silent myocardial ischaemia using gated myocardial perfusion SPECT?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: A higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in HIV-infected patients, together with chronic infection and treatments, has resulted in an increased risk of silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI). The objective of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease. METHODS: The prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV infection status, and treatment. RESULTS: Coronary artery disease was detected in nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with a diagnosis of SMI (p < 0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01). All the positive myocardial SPECT scans were in men older than 52 years with at least two other CRFs. In this subpopulation of 47 patients, the prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT reached 19.2 %. CONCLUSION: In male HIV-infected patients older than 52 years and with at least two other CRFs, screening for SMI using myocardial SPECT was about four times more likely to be positive than in the general population. This may motivate physicians to advise these patients to undergo more systematic screening for SMI using this technique."]}
{"question": "Does the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites result in serious acute side effects?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and severity of acute side effects from the use of polyvalent antivenin in victims of rattlesnake bites. DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who presented with rattlesnake bites to a university teaching hospital during an 11-year period. From patient medical records, we extracted demographic data, clinical measurements, and outcomes during emergency department evaluation and subsequent hospitalization. Data regarding serum sickness were not collected. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome variables were the occurrence of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to antivenin, the type of reaction, permanent disability at hospital discharge, and mortality. RESULTS: We identified a total of 73 patients with rattlesnake bites during the study period. Bite envenomation was graded as nonenvenomated, 7 patients (10%); mild, 23 patients (32%); moderate, 32 patients (44%); and severe, 11 patients (15%). We identified 65 patients who received antivenin. Antivenin doses ranged from 1 to 30 vials per patient (mean, 12.0 +/- 6.0), for a total of 777 vials. In 43 patients (66%), 10 or more vials of antivenin were given. The mean number of vials of antivenin given to each snakebite grade were as follows: mild, 8.4 (+/-4.0); moderate, 11.8 (+/-5.7); and severe, 18.7 (+/-6.3). No deaths, amputations, or permanent disability from snakebite occurred in the patients receiving antivenin. Acute side effects of antivenin-occurring within the first 6 hours after administration-were seen in 12 patients (18%; 95% confidence interval, 10%-30%). Acute side effects consisted solely of urticaria in all but 1 patient (2%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-8%). This patient had a history of previous antivenin reaction and required a short course of intravenous epinephrine for blood pressure support. No other complications occurred. CONCLUSION: The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon."]}
{"question": "Does increased use of private health care reduce the demand for NHS care?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The use of the private sector for health care is increasing, but it is unclear whether this will reduce demand on the NHS. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between private and NHS outpatient referral rates accounting for their association with deprivation. METHODS: This is a prospective survey of general practitioner referrals to private and NHS consultant-led services between 1 January and 31 December 2001 from 10 general practices in the Trent Focus Collaborative Research Network, United Kingdom. Patient referrals were aggregated to give private and NHS referral rates for each electoral ward in each practice. RESULTS: Of 17,137 referrals, 90.4 percent (15,495) were to the NHS and 9.6 percent (1642) to the private sector. Private referral rates were lower in patients from the most deprived fifth of wards compared with the least deprived fifth (rate ratio 0.25, 95 percent CI 0.15 to 0.41, p < 0.001), whereas NHS referral rates were slightly higher in patients in the most deprived fifth of wards (rate ratio 1.18, 95 percent CI 0.98 to 1.42, p = 0.08) both after age standardisation and adjustment for practice. The NHS referral rate was significantly higher (rate ratio 1.40, 95 percent CI 1.15 to 1.71, p = 0.001) in wards with private referral rates in the top fifth compared with the bottom fifth after adjustment for deprivation and practice. CONCLUSIONS: Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "BACKGROUND: This study assessed whether there is an association between changes in publicly and privately funded care for procedures classified as low value by the National Health Service (NHS) in England following implementation of the Evidence-Based Intervention (EBI) programme. Category 1 procedures should not be conducted and are no longer reimbursed by the NHS. Category 2 procedures are only reimbursed by the NHS in certain circumstances. METHODS: Changes in volumes of publicly and privately funded procedures per month in 2019-2020 compared with the previous year were analysed in private hospitals and local healthcare markets, and adjusted for volume of procedures and patient case mix including age, sex, co-morbidities, and deprivation. Supplementary analyses focused on the self-pay and insurance funding mechanisms. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant association between changes in publicly and privately funded care for category 2 procedures at the hospital (-0.19, 95 per cent c.i. -0.25 to -0.12) and local healthcare market level of analysis (-0.24, -0.32 to -0.15). A statistically significant association for category 1 procedures only existed at the hospital level of analysis (-0.19, -0.30 to -0.08). Findings were similar for patients accessing care through self-pay and insurance funding mechanisms. CONCLUSION: Stronger associations between changes in publicly and privately funded care for category 2 procedures may exist as they are clinically indicated in certain circumstances. Reductions in publicly funded care were likely a combined result of the EBI programme and growing NHS waiting lists, whereas increases in privately funded care were influenced by both patient and supplier-induced demand.", "The cost of health care continues to rise in the face of an apparently insatiable demand. Unless the actual need for health care can be reduced to manageable levels, the financial burden will probably become economically unacceptable. Although some illnesses are unavoidable, others that are largely due to unhealthy lifestyles are preventable. Circulatory diseases, diabetes and some cancers, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in western societies, are strongly linked to physical inactivity, psychological stress, unhealthy eating, obesity and smoking. There is ample evidence that promotion of healthy lifestyles, including physical activity, healthy eating and non-smoking, are effective for the primary and secondary prevention of these diseases. Although there are examples of successful public health programmes that have encouraged more healthy lifestyles and reduced the burden of disease, we need to be much more effective in putting theory into practice. In order to improve the health of the nation and to prevent the economy being overwhelmed by the increasing demand for health care, we need a change of mindset from a consumerist approach to an acceptance of personal and corporate responsibility for more healthy lifestyles. Widespread collaboration among health care agencies, private and public utilities, the entertainment industry and the communications media will be necessary in order to provide the necessary incentives for lifestyle changes.", "The survival of the NHS lies largely in the hands of government, and this article suggests steps that it should take to deal with pressures on the NHS in terms of funding, managing efficiency, and demands. Changes to the system of funding may be unfeasible, but management could be improved by research to allow greater understanding of the local effects of national policies. Alternatively health authorities could be given more freedom to manage funds, although this would have to be accompanied by stiff sanctions for those who failed. Demand could be contained by strengthening policies to ensure that new technologies are cost effective. The government could try to reduce demands arising from increased expectations by encouraging informed public debate about priorities and influencing the availability of private health care. All these efforts should be guided by the values underpinning the NHS, which should be debated and decided collectively and confirmed in a new charter for NHS's 50th anniversary in 1998.", "Annual patient attendances at a pre-operative assessment department increased by 24.8% from 5659 in 2009, to 7062 in 2012. The unit was staffed by administrative staff, nurses, and health care assistants (HCA). Medical review was accessed via on call medical staff, or notes were sent to anaesthetists for further review. With rising demand, patient waits increased. The average lead time for a patient (time from entering the department to leaving) was 79 minutes. 9.3% of patients attended within two weeks of their scheduled surgery date. 10% of patients were asked to return on a later day, as there was not sufficient capacity to undertake their assessment. There were nine routes of referral in to the department. Patients moved between different clinic rooms and the waiting area several times. Work patterns were uneven, as many attendances were from out-patient clinics which meant peak attendance times were linked to clinic times. There were substantial differences in the approaches of different nurses, making the HCA role difficult. Patients reported dissatisfaction with waits. Using a Lean quality improvement process with rapid PDSA cycles, the service changed to one in which patients were placed in a room, and remained there for the duration of their assessment. Standard work was developed for HCWs and nurses. Rooms were standardised using 5S processes, and set up improved to reduce time spent looking for supplies. A co-ordinator role was introduced using existing staff to monitor flow and to organise the required medical assessments and ECGs. Timing of booked appointments were altered to take account of clinic times. Routes in to the department were reduced from nine to one. Ten months after the work began, the average lead time had reduced to 59 minutes. The proportion of people attending within two weeks of their surgery decreased from 9.3% to 5.3%. Referrals for an anaesthetic opinion decreased from 30% to 20%, and in the month reviewed no one had to return to be seen as a result of limited capacity."]}
{"question": "Does confined placental mosaicism account for adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: IVF singletons have poorer perinatal outcomes than singletons from spontaneous conceptions. This may be due to the influence of ovarian stimulation on the chromosomal constitution of the embryos which could be translated into localized chromosomal anomalies in the placenta. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of confined placental mosaicism (CPM) in IVF/ICSI pregnancies and spontaneous conceptions. METHODS: We conducted a multi-centre retrospective analysis of karyotype results obtained by chorionic villus sampling (CVS), performed due to advanced maternal age (>or=36 years at 18 weeks of gestation), in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2005. RESULTS: From a total of 322 246 pregnancies, 20 885 CVS results were analysed: 235 in the IVF/ICSI group and 20 650 in the control group. The mean age of women in both groups was 38.4 years (mean difference -0.08, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.18). Data relating to the fetal karyotype were missing in 143 cases in the control group. When taking into account missing data, the incidence of CPM was lower in the IVF-ICSI group than in the control group, 1.3% versus 2.2% (odds ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.19-1.85), whereas the incidence of fetal chromosomal anomalies was increased 4.3% versus 2.4% (odds ratio 1.81, 95% CI 0.95-3.42). Neither differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI."]}
{"question": "Utility of unenhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted MRI in children with sickle cell disease -- can it differentiate bone infarcts from acute osteomyelitis?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of bone infarcts and acute osteomyelitis. The clinical differentiation between a bone infarct and acute osteomyelitis is a diagnostic challenge. Unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated MR images have been proposed as a potential tool to differentiate bone infarcts from osteomyelitis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reliability of unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated MRI for differentiation between bone infarcts and acute osteomyelitis in children with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 31 children (20 boys, 11 girls; mean age 10.6 years, range 1.1-17.9 years) with SCD and acute bone pain who underwent MR imaging including unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated images from 2005 to 2010. Complete clinical charts were reviewed by a pediatric hematologist with training in infectious diseases to determine a clinical standard to define the presence or absence of osteomyelitis. A pediatric radiologist reviewed all MR imaging and was blinded to clinical information. Based on the signal intensity in T1-W fat-saturated images, the children were further classified as positive for osteomyelitis (low bone marrow signal intensity) or positive for bone infarct (high bone marrow signal intensity). RESULTS: Based on the clinical standard, 5 children were classified as positive for osteomyelitis and 26 children as positive for bone infarct (negative for osteomyelitis). The bone marrow signal intensity on T1-W fat-saturated imaging was not significant for the differentiation between bone infarct and osteomyelitis (P = 0.56). None of the additional evaluated imaging parameters on unenhanced MRI proved reliable in differentiating these diagnoses. CONCLUSION: The bone marrow signal intensity on unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated MR images is not a reliable criterion to differentiate bone infarcts from osteomyelitis in children."]}

Chest radiographs were obtained and interpreted, and patients were divided into 2 groups based on a pathologic versus nonpathologic radiograph interpretation. Chi2 testing was performed for categoric variables, and the student t test was performed for continuous variables. A discriminant analysis was used to develop a model. RESULTS: Pathologic radiographs were identified in 61 patients (9%). Between groups, a significant difference was noted for pretreatment oxygen saturation only. Clinical score, respiratory rate, and presence of rales both pretreatment and posttreatment were not significantly different between groups. The discriminant analysis correctly predicted 90% of nonpathologic radiographs but only 15% of pathologic radiographs. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical variables, either isolated or as components of a model, could not identify all children with pathologic radiographs.", "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether historical or clinical variables can accurately discriminate among children, experiencing a first episode of bronchospasm, with chest radiography findings that are normal, consistent with reactive airway disease (RAD), or pathologic. METHODS: We assembled a prospective case series of patients in our tertiary, academic, pediatric emergency department. All patients aged newborn to 18 years presenting to the ED with their initial episode of wheezing were enrolled. RESULTS: Six hundred thirty-three patients presented to the ED during the study period. Pathologic radiographic findings were identified in 39 (6.2%). Radiographs revealing normal findings and evidence of RAD were noted in 25.4% and 68%, respectively. No single variable accurately predicted all pathologic radiographs. Discriminant function analysis identified nine variables, which we combined into a model. The model failed to accurately discriminate among patients with radiographs revealing evidence of a pathologic condition, normal chest findings, and RAD. CONCLUSION: No clinical variables, isolated or combined into a model, accurately identify patients with pathologic radiography findings. Continued use of chest radiography as a diagnostic intervention in the initial episode of childhood bronchospasm is recommended."]}

{"question": "MiraLAX vs. Golytely: is there a significant difference in the adenoma detection rate?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: In recent clinical trials (RCT) of bowel preparation, Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX. We hypothesised that there is a difference in adenoma detection between Golytely and MiraLAX. AIMS: To compare the adenoma detection rate (ADR) between these bowel preparations, and to identify independent predictors of bowel preparation quality and adenoma detection. METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of an RCT that assessed efficacy and patient tolerability of Golytely vs. MiraLAX/Gatorade in average risk screening colonoscopy patients. Bowel preparation quality was measured with the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). An excellent/good equivalent BBPS score was defined as >/= 7. Polyp pathology review was performed. ADR was defined as the proportion of colonoscopies with an adenoma. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety patients were prospectively enrolled (87 MiraLAX, 103 Golytely). Golytely had a higher rate of a BBPS score >/= 7 (82.5% vs. MiraLAX 67.8%, P=0.02). The ADR in the Golytely cohort was 26.2% (27/103), and was 16.1% (14/87) for MiraLAX (P = 0.091). On multivariate analyses, Golytely was 2.13 x more likely to be associated with a BBPS >/= 7 (95% CI 1.05-4.32, P = 0.04) and 2.28 x more likely to be associated with adenoma detection (95% CI 1.05-4.98, P = 0.04) than MiraLAX. CONCLUSIONS: Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS >/= 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results."]}
{"question": "Does government assistance improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To examine whether government-funded, low-income vision care programs improve use of eye care services by low-income individuals in Canada. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: 27,375 white respondents to the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Healthy Aging 2008/2009. METHODS: Government-funded, low-income vision care programs were reviewed. The amount of assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for general/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS. RESULTS: To receive low-income vision care assistance, individuals must be in receipt of social assistance. Criteria for receiving social assistance are stringent. The Canadian Financial Capability Survey revealed that 7.9% of Canadians aged 45 to 64 years and 5.5% aged >/=65 years received social assistance in 2009. The CCHS found in 2008/2009 that 12.5% of citizens aged 45 to 64 years and 13.2% of those aged >/=65 years had difficulty paying for basic expenses such as food. In 5 provinces, low-income vision care assistance fully covers a general/routine eye examination. In the remainder, the assistance provided is insufficient for a general/routine eye examination. The assistance for eyeglasses is inadequate in 5 provinces, requiring out-of-pocket copayments. Among middle-aged whites who self-reported not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by lenses, utilization of eye care providers was 28.1% among those with financial difficulty versus 41.9% among those without (p < 0.05), giving a prevalence ratio 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) adjusted for age, sex and education.

The prognosis for occupational contact dermatitis is often poor. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prognosis, assessed by eczema, job status and skin-related quality of life, among patients allergic to rubber chemicals and latex (ubiquitous allergens) and epoxy (nonubiquitous allergen), 2 years after recognition of occupational allergic contact dermatitis. METHODS: From a cohort of all patients recognized as having occupational dermatitis by the Danish National Board of Industrial Injuries in 2010, 199 patients with relevant rubber allergy (contact allergy to rubber chemicals or contact urticaria from latex) or epoxy allergy were identified. Follow-up consisted of a questionnaire covering current severity of eczema, employment, exposure and quality of life. RESULTS: The response rate was 75%. Clearance of eczema was reported by 11% of patients and 67% reported improvement. Overall 22% of patients with allergy to a nonubiquitous allergen had total clearance of eczema compared with 10% of cases allergic to ubiquitous allergens and 0% of those with contact urticaria (P = 0.116). Improvement was significantly more frequent in those who had changed jobs compared with those who had not (P = 0.01).

We aimed to assess the role of calprotectin tests in predicting clinical relapse in IBD patients. METHODS: Ninety-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 65 with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission were prospectively included in the study. A 10-g stool sample was collected for calprotectin assay. The cutoff level was set at 130 mg/kg of feces. Patients were followed up for 1 yr after the test or until relapse. The cumulative proportion of relapses was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistics for equality of survival distribution were tested using the log-rank test. RESULTS: The calprotectin test was positive in 44 UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC patients (P= 0.000). In CD patients, only cases of colonic CD showed a significant correlation between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse, i.e., 6 colonic CD patients were positive for the calprotectin test and 4 relapsed (P= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Measuring calprotectin may help to identify UC and colonic CD patients at higher risk of clinical relapse.", "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An evaluation is made of the utility of fecal calprotectin in predicting relapse in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The possible differences in its predictive capacity in Crohn's disease (CD) versus ulcerative colitis (UC), and the different phenotypes, are also examined. METHODS: This is a prospective study with 135 patients diagnosed with IBD in clinical remission for at least 3 months. The patients submitted a stool sample within 24 hours after the baseline visit, for the measurement of fecal calprotectin. All patients were followed-up on for one year. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients had CD and 69 UC. Thirty-nine (30%) suffered from relapse. The fecal calprotectin concentration was higher among the patients with relapse than in those that remained in remission: 444 microg/g (95% CI 34-983) versus 112 microg/g (95% CI 22-996); p<0.01. Patients with CD and calprotectin>200 microg/g relapsed 4 times more often than those with lower marker concentrations. In UC, calprotectin>120 microg/g was associated with a 6-fold increase in the probability of disease activity outbreak. The predictive value was similar in UC and CD with colon involvement and inflammatory pattern. In this group, calprotectin>120 microg/g predicted relapse risk with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 60%. Relapse predictive capacity was lower in patients with ileal disease. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal calprotectin may be a useful marker for predicting relapse in patients with IBD. Its predictive value is greater in UC and CD with colon involvement and inflammatory pattern, compared with ileal CD.", "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease is characterised by a succession of relapses and remissions. The aim of our study was to assess whether the predictive value of faecal calprotectin-a non-invasive marker of intestinal inflammation-for clinical relapse is different in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Seventy nine consecutive patients with a diagnosis of clinically quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (38 CD and 41 UC) were followed for 12 months, undergoing regular clinical evaluations and blood tests. A single stool sample was collected at the beginning of the study from each patient and the calprotectin concentration was assessed by a commercially available enzyme linked immunoassay. RESULTS: In CD, median calprotectin values were 220.1 mug/g (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.7-418.5) in those patients who relapsed during follow up, and 220.5 mug/g (95% CI 53-388) in non-relapsing patients (p=0.395). In UC, median calprotectin values were 220.6 mug/g (95% CI 86-355.2) and 67 microg/g (95% CI 15-119) in relapsing and non-relapsing patients, respectively (p<0.0001). The multivariate Cox (proportional hazard) regression model, after adjustment for possible confounding variables, showed a twofold and 14-fold increase in the relapse risk, respectively, in those patients with CD and UC in clinical remission who had a faecal calprotectin concentration higher than 150 microg/g. CONCLUSIONS: Faecal calprotectin proved to be an even stronger predictor of clinical relapse in UC than in CD, which makes the test a promising non-invasive tool for monitoring and optimising therapy.", "BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to determine the role of fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in the prediction of inflammatory bowel disease relapses, both in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), in a large, long-term, follow-up study. METHODS: The prospective multicenter study included CD and UC patients who had been in clinical remission for 6 months. At baseline, patients provided a single stool sample for calprotectin and lactoferrin determination. Follow-up was 12 months in patients showing no relapse and until activity flare in relapsing patients. RESULTS: In all, 163 patients (89 CD, 74 UC) were included. Twenty-six patients (16%) relapsed during follow-up. Calprotectin concentrations in patients who suffered a relapse were higher than in nonrelapsing patients (239 +/- 150 versus 136 +/- 158 microg/g; P < 0.001). Relapse risk was higher in patients having high (>150 microg/g) calprotectin concentrations (30% versus 7.8%; P < 0.001) or positive lactoferrin (25% versus 10%; P < 0.05). Fecal calprotectin (>150 microg/g) sensitivity and specificity to predict relapse were 69% and 69%, respectively. Corresponding values for lactoferrin were 62% and 65%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to predict relapse using calprotectin determination was 0.73 (0.69 for UC and 0.77 for CD). Better results were obtained when only colonic CD disease or only relapses during the first 3 months were considered (100% sensitivity). High fecal calprotectin levels or lactoferrin positivity was associated with clinical relapse in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and both fecal tests were associated with relapse in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin determination may be useful in predicting impending clinical relapse-especially during the following 3 months-in both CD and UC patients.", "BACKGROUND: Teenagers with inflammatory bowel disease undergo regular follow-up visits to watch for symptoms that may indicate relapse. Current disease activity is frequently estimated with the use of the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). We examined the capacity of fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict relapse in teenagers who report no symptoms. Second, we examined whether calprotectin and CRP as an \"add-on test\" improve the specificity of PUCAI or PCDAI to predict relapse. METHODS: We collected data of 62 consecutive teenagers (31 with Crohn's disease and 31 with ulcerative colitis) who scored their degree of disease control between 90 and 100% on two successive outpatient clinic visits. Calprotectin, PUCAI or PCDAI, and CRP were measured at baseline. Primary outcome was symptomatic relapse within 3 months of baseline, necessitating the introduction of steroids, exclusive enteral nutrition, or an aminosalicylate dose escalation. RESULTS: Fifteen teenagers (24%) developed symptomatic relapse within 3 months of baseline. Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the optimum calprotectin cutpoint to differentiate high from low risk patients was 500 mug/g. The PUCAI or PCDAI predicted relapse in 42% (11/26) of teenagers with a positive result (score >/= 10 points), while a negative PUCAI or PCDAI result reduced the risk of relapse to 11% (4/36). Teenagers with a positive calprotectin test had a 53% (10/19) risk of progressing to symptomatic relapse within 3 months, whereas a negative calprotectin result gave a 12% (5/43) risk of symptomatic relapse. A positive CRP result (cutoff 10 mg/L) gave a 50% (4/8) risk of relapse, whereas a negative CRP result hardly reduced the risk compared with the pretest probability (from 24% to 21% (11/53)). As an add-on test after PUCAI or PCDAI, the calprotectin test limited the number of false positives and thus increased the specificity to detect gastrointestinal inflammation: 60% (9/15) of teenagers with positive concordant test results progressed to symptomatic relapse. Negative concordance reduced the risk of relapse to 10% (3/32). CRP contributed little as add-on test after PUCAI or PCDAI: two of five teenagers with positive concordant tests progressed to symptomatic relapse (40%). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike CRP, fecal calprotectin as an add-on test after PUCAI or PCDAI facilitates recognition of preclinical relapse. This could help to identify teenagers who require treatment intensification at the time of minimal disease rather than at the time of clinically overt relapse. Further studies are warranted to determine the impact of fecal calprotectin testing on treatment management and outcome."]}
{"question": "Can nurse-led preoperative education reduce anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The effect of preoperative education on anxiety and postoperative outcomes of cardiac surgery patients remains unclear. AIM: The aim of the study was to estimate the effectiveness of a nurse-led preoperative education on anxiety and postoperative outcomes. METHODS: A randomised controlled study was designed. All the patients who were admitted for elective cardiac surgery in a general hospital in Athens with knowledge of the Greek language were eligible to take part in the study. Patients in the intervention group received preoperative education by specially trained nurses. The control group received the standard information by the ward personnel. Measurements of anxiety were conducted on admission-A, before surgery-B and before discharge-C by the state-trait anxiety inventory. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 395 patients (intervention group: 205, control group: 190). The state anxiety on the day before surgery decreased only in the intervention group (34.0 (8.4) versus 36.9 (10.7); P=0.001). The mean decrease in state score during the follow-up period was greater in the intervention group (P=0.001). No significant difference was found in the length of stay or readmission. Lower proportions of chest infection were found in the intervention group (10 (5.3) versus 1 (0.5); P=0.004). Multivariate linear regression revealed that education and score in trait anxiety scale on admission are independent predictors of a reduction in state anxiety. CONCLUSION: Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay."]}
{"question": "Impact of MPH programs: contributing to health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The \"health workforce\" crisis has led to an increased interest in health professional education, including MPH programs. Recently, it was questioned whether training of mid- to higher level cadres in public health prepared graduates with competencies to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Measuring educational impact has been notoriously difficult; therefore, innovative methods for measuring the outcome and impact of MPH programs were sought. Impact was conceptualized as \"impact on workplace\" and \"impact on society,\" which entailed studying how these competencies were enacted and to what effect within the context of the graduates' workplaces, as well as on societal health. METHODS: This is part of a larger six-country mixed method study; in this paper, the focus is on the qualitative findings of two English language programs, one a distance MPH program offered from South Africa, the other a residential program in the Netherlands. Both offer MPH training to students from a diversity of countries. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 graduates (per program), working in low- and middle-income health systems, their peers, and their supervisors. RESULTS: Impact on the workplace was reported as considerable by graduates and peers as well as supervisors and included changes in management and leadership: promotion to a leadership position as well as expanded or revitalized management roles were reported by many participants. The development of leadership capacity was highly valued amongst many graduates, and this capacity was cited by a number of supervisors and peers. Wider impact in the workplace took the form of introducing workplace innovations such as setting up an AIDS and addiction research center and research involvement; teaching and training, advocacy, and community engagement were other ways in which graduates' influence reached a wider target grouping. Beyond the workplace, an intersectoral approach, national reach through policy advisory roles to Ministries of Health, policy development, and capacity building, was reported. Work conditions and context influenced conduciveness for innovation and the extent to which graduates were able to have effect. Self-selection of graduates and their role in selecting peers and supervisors may have resulted in some bias, some graduates could not be traced, and social acceptability bias may have influenced findings. CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable impact at many levels; graduates were perceived to be able to contribute significantly to their workplaces and often had influence at the national level. Much of the impact described was in line with public health educational aims. The qualitative method study revealed more in-depth understanding of graduates' impact as well as their career pathways."]}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two HHLs that were diagnosed by computed tomographic (CT) arteriography were evaluated retrospectively. The lesion on DWI was classified as isointense, hypointense, or hyperintense. Follow-up studies that included intravenous dynamic CT or magnetic resonance imaging were performed. RESULTS: The 730-day cumulative developments of vascularization in hypointense, isointense, and hyperintense lesions were 17%, 30%, and 40%, respectively. The differences among these developments were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization."]}
{"question": "Are failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction associated with steep posterior tibial slopes?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) later experience graft failure. Some studies suggest an association between a steep posterior tibial slope (PTS) and graft failure. PURPOSE: To examine the PTS in a large cohort of patients about to undergo ACLR and to determine whether a steep PTS is associated with later revision surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A retrospective review of a cohort undergoing isolated ACLR between 2002 and 2012 (with 8-19 years of follow-up) was conducted. Preoperative sagittal radiographs of knees in full extension were used for measurements of the PTS. There were 2 independent examiners who performed repeated measurements to assess the reliability of the method. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the PTS in the groups with and without later revision surgery. RESULTS: A total of 728 patients, with a mean age of 28 years at the time of surgery, were included. Overall, 10% (n = 76) underwent revision surgery during the observation period. The group of injured knees had a significantly steeper PTS compared with the group of uninjured knees (9.5 degrees  vs 8.7 degrees , respectively; P < .05). The mean PTS in the no revision group was 9.5 degrees  compared with 9.3 degrees  in the revision group (not significant). Dichotomized testing of revision rates related to PTS cutoff values of >/=10 degrees , >/=12 degrees , >/=14 degrees , >/=16 degrees , and >/=18 degrees  showed no association of PTS steepness (not significant) to graft failure. Patients with revision were younger than the ones without (mean age, 24 +/- 8 vs 29 +/- 10 years, respectively) and had a shorter time from injury to ACLR (mean, 14 +/- 27 vs 24 +/- 44 months, respectively) as well as a smaller graft size (8.2 vs 8.4 mm, respectively; P = .040). CONCLUSION: The current study did not find any association between a steep PTS measured on lateral knee radiographs and revision ACL surgery. However, a steeper PTS was seen in the group of injured knees compared with the group of uninjured (contralateral) knees. Independent of the PTS, younger patients, those with a shorter time from injury to surgery, and those with a smaller graft size were found to undergo revision surgery more often.", "BACKGROUND: Recently, increasing number of literature has identified the posterior tibial slope (PTS) as one of the risk factors of primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, few studies concerning the association between failure of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and PTS have been published. The objective of this study was to explore the association between the failure of ACLR and PTS at a minimum of two years follow-up. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty eight eligible patients from June 2009 to October 2010 were identified from our database. A total of 20 failure cases of ACLR and 20 randomly selected controls were included in this retrospective study. The demographic data and the results of manual maximum side-to-side difference with KT-1000 arthrometer at 30 degrees  of knee flexion and pivot-shift test before the ACLR and at the final follow-up were collected. The medial and lateral PTSs were measured using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, based on Hudek's measurement. A comparison of PTS between the two groups was performed. RESULTS: The overall failure rate of the present study was 8.4%. Of the 40 participants, the mean medial PTS was 4.1 degrees  +/- 3.2 degrees  and the mean lateral PTS was 4.6 degrees  +/- 2.6 degrees . The medial PTS of the ACLR failure group was significantly steeper than the control group (3.5 degrees  +/- 2.5 degrees  vs. 6.1 degrees  +/- 2.1 degrees , P = 0.000). Similarly, the lateral PTS of the ACLR failure group was significantly steeper than the control group (2.9 degrees  +/- 2.1 degrees  vs. 5.5 degrees  +/- 3.0 degrees , P = 0.006). For medial PTS >/= 5 degrees , the odds ratio of ACLR failure was 6.8 (P = 0.007); for lateral PTS >/=5 degrees , the odds ratio of ACLR failure was 10.8 (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS >/=5 degrees  was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "BACKGROUND: Steep posterior tibial slope (PTS; >13 degrees ), excessive anterior tibial subluxation (ATS) in extension (>10 mm), and meniscus posterior horn tears (MPHTs) have been identified to be associated with primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) failure. Recent studies have reported that steep PTS is directly correlated with excessive ATS in extension and concomitant MPHTs, especially for those patients with chronic (>6 months) ACL deficiency. There is increasing biomechanical evidence that slope-reducing tibial osteotomy decreases ATS in extension and protects the ACL graft. HYPOTHESIS: Slope-reducing tibial osteotomy combined with primary ACLR is effective for producing improved knee stability in patients with steep PTS (>13 degrees ), excessive ATS in extension (>10 mm), and concomitant chronic MPHTs (>6 months). STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Between June 2016 and January 2018, 18 patients with ACL injuries who had steep PTS (>13 degrees ), excessive ATS in extension (>10 mm), and concomitant chronic MPHTs (>6 months) underwent slope-reducing tibial osteotomy combined with primary ACLR. The PTS and anterior subluxation of the lateral and medial compartment (ASLC and ASMC) in extension before and after the index procedures were regarded as primary clinical outcomes. Moreover, Lysholm score, Tegner activity score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) objective grade, pivot-shift test, and KT-1000 side-to-side difference were evaluated preoperatively and at the minimum 2-year follow-up visit. RESULTS: The mean PTS was 18.5 degrees  (range, 17 degrees -20 degrees ) preoperatively and 8.1 degrees  (range, 7 degrees -9 degrees ) postoperatively (P < .01). The mean ASLC and ASMC in extension were 12.1 mm and 11.9 mm preoperatively, which reduced to 1.0 mm and 1.5 mm at the last follow-up visit (P < .05). In addition, all of the following showed significant improvements (pre- vs postoperatively): mean Lysholm score (46.5 vs 89.5; P < .05), mean Tegner activity score (5.7 vs 7.3; P < .05), IKDC objective grading results (18 grade D vs 14 grade A and 4 grade B; P < .05), pivot-shift tests (15 grade 2+ and 3 grade 3+ vs 18 grade 0; P < .01), and KT-1000 side-to-side difference (13.0 mm vs 1.6 mm; P < .01). Moreover, no graft reruptures were found at the final follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: In this study, slope-reducing tibial osteotomy combined with primary ACLR effectively improved knee stability in patients with steep PTS (>13 degrees ), excessive ATS in extension (>10 mm), and concomitant chronic MPHTs (>6 months).", "PURPOSE: To assess the role of Tibial Plateau Slope (TPS) as risk factor for early Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction failure and contralateral ACL injury in a population of patients with less than 18 years of age and operated on with the same surgical technique. METHODS: Ninety-four consecutive patients (mean age 15.7 +/- 1.5 years) with at least 2 years of follow-up, who underwent ACL reconstruction with a single-bundle plus lateral-plasty hamstring technique in the same centre were included. Subsequent ACL injuries (ipsilateral ACL revision or contralateral ACL reconstruction) were assessed within the first 2 years after surgery. Anterior, central, posterior TPS of medial compartment were measured on lateral radiographs and compared between patients with intact graft and those with a second injury. Cut-off values with sensitivity and specificity were calculated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Survival analysis for second ACL injuries and multivariate analysis were performed. RESULTS: Eight patients (9%) had ipsilateral ACL Revision and eight patients (9%) had contralateral ACL reconstruction. Patients with contralateral injury had a higher Central TPS with respect to those without second injury (12.6 degrees  +/- 2.8 degrees  vs 9.3 degrees  +/- 3.7 degrees , p = 0.042). No differences were present in patients with ipsilateral ACL revision. Sensitivity and specificity for central TPS slope >/= 12 degrees  to detect a contralateral rupture were 63% and 75% (p = 0.0092), for Anterior TPS were 100% and 52% (p = 0.0009). Patients with TPS values exceeding these cut-offs had higher rate of contralateral ACL injuries (19%vs4%, p = 0.0420) and lower 2-year survival (p = 0.0049). Multivariate analysis identified pre-operative sport level and TPS (either anterior or central) as risk factors for contralateral injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Steep tibial plateau slope >/= 12 degrees  is associated with a higher risk of contralateral ACL injury within 2 years after ACL reconstruction in patients less than 18 years of age. However, TPS has no role in early ipsilateral re-injury after combined ACL reconstruction and lateral plasty. The clinical relevance is that both the surgeon and the patient should be aware of this higher risk and consider it in the rehabilitation phase to reduce the incidence of such injuries.

{"question": "Does evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate whether evidence-based clinical practice in health care improves outcomes for patients, personnel, and/or organizations. METHODS: A systematic review of studies was conducted with various quantitative and qualitative methods up to the Spring of 2002. Protocols were used in quality assessment. Data synthesis is descriptive in a narrative form. RESULTS: Of 305 assessed articles, eight studies were included. The outcomes in the included studies were related to the experiences of patients and personnel and to organization concerning changed patient care and resource utilization. Because the included studies are heterogeneous in design, focus of research area, and scientific quality, the scientific foundation for the findings is weak. There is some support that evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, when put to use, improve outcomes (i) for patients--less likelihood of showing worsening of skin condition and disruption of skin condition improves more rapidly for infants; (ii) for personnel--support in daily work situation; and (iii) for organizations--decreased admission rates and length of stay, less resource utilization and reduced costs. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for further research as the findings are based on a rather limited number of studies. There is a tendency toward support for the idea that outcomes improve for patients, personnel, or organizations if clinical practice in health care is evidence-based, that is, if evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are used, although these findings could be specific to the settings and context of the studies reported in this systematic review.", "RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity. METHODS: We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors. CONCLUSION: The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.", "BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practice and decision-making have been consistently linked to improved quality of care, patient safety, and many positive clinical outcomes in isolated reports throughout the literature. However, a comprehensive summary and review of the extent and type of evidence-based practices (EBPs) and their associated outcomes across clinical settings are lacking. AIMS: The purpose of this scoping review was to provide a thorough summary of published literature on the implementation of EBPs on patient outcomes in healthcare settings. METHODS: A comprehensive librarian-assisted search was done with three databases, and two reviewers independently performed title/abstract and full-text reviews within a systematic review software system. Extraction was performed by the eight review team members. RESULTS: Of 8537 articles included in the review, 636 (7.5%) met the inclusion criteria. Most articles (63.3%) were published in the United States, and 90% took place in the acute care setting. There was substantial heterogeneity in project definitions, designs, and outcomes. Various EBPs were implemented, with just over a third including some aspect of infection prevention, and most (91.2%) linked to reimbursement. Only 19% measured return on investment (ROI); 94% showed a positive ROI, and none showed a negative ROI. The two most reported outcomes were length of stay (15%), followed by mortality (12%). LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Findings indicate that EBPs improve patient outcomes and ROI for healthcare systems. Coordinated and consistent use of established nomenclature and methods to evaluate EBP and patient outcomes are needed to effectively increase the growth and impact of EBP across care settings. Leaders, clinicians, publishers, and educators all have a professional responsibility related to improving the current state of EBP. Several key actions are needed to mitigate confusion around EBP and to help clinicians understand the differences between quality improvement, implementation science, EBP, and research.", "The motivation for teaching evidence-based practice is that, through the use of high-quality clinically relevant evidence, clinicians will make rationale decision that optimally improve patient health outcomes. Achieving that goal requires clinicians who are able to answer patient care-relevant clinical questions efficiently, which means that they must be able rapidly to retrieve, assess, and apply evidence of direct relevance to their patients. Educational programs designed to accomplish this vary in their effectiveness. This article reviews the evidence on educational approaches that may be beneficial when developing educational programs for both dental students and practicing dentists.", "Evidence-based practice supports the patient care process by integrating patient values and preferences with clinician expertise and the best available evidence. This approach to patient care focuses on quality and safety with the aim of improving patient outcomes. Despite its obvious value, healthcare professionals struggle to integrate evidence-based best practices into their clinical practice."]}
{"question": "Multidisciplinary decisions in breast cancer: does the patient receive what the team has recommended?", "retrieved_passages": ["National guidance and clinical guidelines recommended multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) for cancer services in order to bring specialists in relevant disciplines together, ensure clinical decisions are fully informed, and to coordinate care effectively. However, the effectiveness of cancer teams was not previously evaluated systematically. A random sample of 72 breast cancer teams in England was studied (548 members in six core disciplines), stratified by region and caseload. Information about team constitution, processes, effectiveness, clinical performance, and members' mental well-being was gathered using appropriate instruments. Two input variables, team workload (P=0.009) and the proportion of breast care nurses (P=0.003), positively predicted overall clinical performance in multivariate analysis using a two-stage regression model. There were significant correlations between individual team inputs, team composition variables, and clinical performance. Some disciplines consistently perceived their team's effectiveness differently from the mean. Teams with shared leadership of their clinical decision-making were most effective. The mental well-being of team members appeared significantly better than in previous studies of cancer clinicians, the NHS, and the general population. This study established that team composition, working methods, and workloads are related to measures of effectiveness, including the quality of clinical care.", "OBJECTIVES: The cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting (MDM) is regarded as the best platform to reduce unwarranted variation in cancer care through evidence-compliant management. However, MDMs are often overburdened with many different agendas and hence struggle to achieve their full potential. The authors developed an interactive clinical decision support system called MATE (Multidisciplinary meeting Assistant and Treatment sElector) to facilitate explicit evidence-based decision making in the breast MDMs. DESIGN: Audit study and a questionnaire survey. SETTING: Breast multidisciplinary unit in a large secondary care teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All members of the breast MDT at the Royal Free Hospital, London, were consulted during the process of MATE development and implementation. The emphasis was on acknowledging the clinical needs and practical constraints of the MDT and fitting the system around the team's workflow rather than the other way around. Delegates, who attended MATE workshop at the England Cancer Networks' Development Programme conference in March 2010, participated in the questionnaire survey. OUTCOME MEASURES: The measures included evidence-compliant care, measured by adherence to clinical practice guidelines, and promoting research, measured by the patient identification rate for ongoing clinical trials. RESULTS: MATE identified 61% more patients who were potentially eligible for recruitment into clinical trials than the MDT, and MATE recommendations demonstrated better concordance with clinical practice guideline than MDT recommendations (97% of MATE vs 93.2% of MDT; N=984). MATE is in routine use in breast MDMs at the Royal Free Hospital, London, and wider evaluations are being considered. CONCLUSIONS: Sophisticated decision support systems can enhance the conduct of MDMs in a way that is acceptable to and valued by the clinical team. Further rigorous evaluations are required to examine cost-effectiveness and measure the impact on patient outcomes. The decision support technology used in MATE is generic and if found useful can be applied across medicine.", "Objective: To analyze adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and explore the influencing factors in the multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) modality. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed. The cases with invasive TNBC who underwent surgery and MDT discussion for adjuvant treatment in Ruijin Hospital, from April 2013 to June 2015, were recruited. The patients' clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed and adjuvant treatment suggestions from MDT were obtained. Here the chemotherapy decision alteration was defined as a disagreement in chemotherapy or not, or inconsistence in regimens between the attending doctor and the multidisciplinary team. Results: A total of 194 patients aged </=70 years old were enrolled in the multidisciplinary discussion, and 187 patients (96.4%) were suggested to receive chemotherapy. When compared the opinions of the attending doctor to suggestions of the multidisciplinary team, we found that the percentage of chemotherapy decision alteration reached 22.7% (39/172), of which 94.9% (37/39) were inconsistence in chemotherapy regimens. There were 119 patients who were recommended to receive epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by docetaxel (T) or weekly paclitaxel (wP) regimens. Before the announcement of results for the E1199 trial, EC-T accounted for 62.5% (55/88), and EC-wP accounted for 37.5% (33/88) for this group of patients. After that, the proportion of EC-T was decreased to 22.6% (7/31) and proportion of EC-wP increased to 77.4%(24/31) (P<0.001). In addition, a total of 20 patients were suggested to receive platinum based chemotherapy. The proportions were 9.3% in cases with invasive ductal carcinoma, and 33.3% in cases with metaplastic carcinoma, respectively (P=0.016). Conclusions: The adjuvant chemotherapy decision for TNBC patients is altered in 22.7% of the patients after MDT discussion. After the announcement of SABCS E1199 results, more patients are suggested to receive EC followed by weekly paclitaxel. There is a lack of detailed evidence for platinum based adjuvant chemotherapy for TNBC, and more patients with metaplastic carcinoma receive platinum based adjuvant chemotherapy.", "Breast conservation therapy (BCT) (usually a lumpectomy plus radiotherapy (RT)) has become a standard alternative to radical mastectomy in early-stage breast cancers with equal, if not higher, survival rates. The established standard of the RT component of the BCT had been about six weeks of Monday through Friday external beam RT to the whole breast (WBRT). Recent clinical trials have shown that partial breast radiation therapy (PBRT) to the region surrounding the lumpectomy cavity with shorter courses can result in equal local control, survival, and slightly improved cosmetic outcomes. Intraoperative RT (IORT) wherein RT is administered at the time of operation for BCT to the lumpectomy cavity as a single-fraction RT is also considered PBRT. The advantage of IORT is that weeks of RT are avoided. However, the role of IORT as part of BCT has been controversial. The extreme views go from \"I will not recommend to anyone\" to \"I can recommend to all early-stage favorable patients.\" These divergent views are due to difficulty in interpreting the clinical trial results. There are two modalities of delivering IORT, namely, the use of low-energy 50 kV beams or electron beams. There are several retrospective, prospective, and two randomized clinical trials comparing IORT versus WBRT. Yet, the opinions are divided. In this paper, we try to bring clarity and consensus from a highly broad-based multidisciplinary team approach. The multidisciplinary team included breast surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical physicists, biostatisticians, public health experts, nurse practitioners, and medical oncologists. We show that there is a need to more carefully interpret and differentiate the data based on electron versus low-dose X-ray modalities; the randomized study results have to be extremely carefully dissected from biostatistical points of view; the importance of the involvement of patients and families in the decision making in a very transparent and informed manner needs to be emphasized; and the compromise some women may be willing to accept between 2-4% potential increase in local recurrence (as interpreted by some of the investigators in IORT randomized studies) versus mastectomy. We conclude that, ultimately, the choice should be that of women with detailed facts of the pros and cons of all options being presented to them from the angle of patient/family-focused care. Although the guidelines of various professional societies can be helpful, they are only guidelines. The participation of women in IORT clinical trials is still needed, and as genome-based and omics-based fine-tuning of prognostic fingerprints evolve, the current guidelines need to be revisited. Finally, the use of IORT can help rural, socioeconomically, and infrastructure-deprived populations and geographic regions as the convenience of single-fraction RT and the possibility of breast preservation are likely to encourage more women to choose BCT than mastectomy. This option can also likely lead to more women choosing to get screened for breast cancer, thus enabling the diagnosis of breast cancer at an earlier stage and improving the survival outcomes.", "Racial disparities in breast cancer mortality have been widely documented for several decades and persist despite advances in receipt of mammography across racial groups. This persistence leads to questions about the roles of biological, social, and health system determinants of poor outcomes. Cancer outcomes are a function not only of innate biological factors but also of modifiable characteristics of individual behavior and decision making as well as characteristics of patient-health system interaction and the health system itself. Attempts to explain persistent racial disparities have mostly been limited to discussion of differences in insurance coverage, socioeconomic status, tumor stage at diagnosis, comorbidity, and molecular subtype of the tumor. This article summarizes existing literature exploring reasons for racial disparities in breast cancer mortality, with an emphasis on treatment disparities and opportunities for future research. Because breast cancer care requires a high degree of multidisciplinary team collaboration, ensuring that guideline recommended treatment (such as endocrine therapy for hormone receptor positive patients) is received by all racial/ethnic groups is critical and requires coordination across multiple providers and health care settings. Recognition that variation in cancer care quality may be correlated with race (and socioeconomic and health system factors) may assist policy makers in identifying strategies to more equally distribute clinical expertise and health infrastructure across multiple user populations."]}
{"question": "Do acute changes in heart rate by isoproterenol affect aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Increased aortic stiffness is a independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. Acute changes of the heart rate (HR) have been reported not to affect the aortic stiffness in pacing. However, it is unknown whether acute changes in HR caused by sympathomimetics can affect the aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension. We investigated the effect of acute changes in HR produced by isoproterenol on the aortic stiffness in 17 hypertensive patientss (mean age: 59 +/- 9 years). METHODS: All vasoactive drugs were discontinued at least 3 days before the study. The carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by the foot-to-foot method. The pulse waves were recorded at the baseline and at every increase of HR by 5 to 10 bpm with a gradual increase of the dose of isoproterenol. The blood pressures and HR were measured simultaneously. For the analysis, HR, PWV, compliance (C), and compliance index (Ci) were converted as percent changes (delta) from the baseline values. Percent changes of the parameters of the aortic stiffness, i.e., deltaPWV, deltaC, and deltaCi, were grouped by every 10% increase in deltaHR. RESULTS: There was no significant difference among groups in deltaPWV, deltaC and deltaCi (p > 0.05 for each of the group). The regression analysis showed no significant correlation of deltaHR with deltaPWV and deltaC (r = 0.18, 0.13 respectively, p > 0.05 for each). deltaCi had a poor correlation with deltaHR (r = 0.22, p < 0.05). However, only 4.6% of deltaCi could be referred to deltaHR (r2 = 0.046). CONCLUSION: Aortic stiffness was not affected by acute changes in HR produced by isoproterenol which suggests that it is not necessary to consider acute changes in HR when measuring aortic PWV."]}
{"question": "\"Occult\" posttraumatic lesions of the knee: can magnetic resonance substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: We investigated the actual role of MRI versus arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in patients with previous musculoskeletal trauma of the knee, pain and severe functional impairment. Occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee are trauma-related bone and/or cartilage damage missed at plain radiography. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat suppression. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified three types of occult post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 8.3%. In 6 stress injuries, the injury site was localized in the medial tibial condyle in 80% of cases, while meniscal and ligament tears were absent. CONCLUSIONS: After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings."]}
{"question": "Could ESC (Electronic Stability Control) change the way we drive?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: ESC (Electronic Stability Control) is a crash avoidance technology that reduces the likelihood of collisions involving loss of control. Although past and emerging research indicates that ESC is effective in reducing collision rates and saving lives, and its inclusion in all vehicle platforms is encouraged, drivers may demonstrate behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC that could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada. METHODS: Two separate telephone surveys evaluated drivers' perceptions and awareness of ESC. The first surveyed 500 randomly selected owners/drivers of passenger vehicles. The second surveyed 1017 owners/drivers of 2006-2008 ESC-equipped passenger vehicles from the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, Canada. RESULTS: Though ESC drivers were much more likely than drivers of other vehicles to be aware of ESC (77% vs. 39%) and that their own vehicle was equipped with it (63% vs. 8%), 23 percent had never heard of it. Ninety percent of drivers who knew that their vehicle was equipped with ESC believed that ESC had made it safer to drive and reported being confident that ESC would work in an emergency. Twenty-three percent of ESC owners who knew their vehicle had ESC reported noticing long-lasting changes in their driving behavior since they began driving the vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members."]}
{"question": "The insertion allele of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism. A candidate gene for insulin resistance?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The insertion/deletion (ID) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD), although the mechanism of this association is not apparent. We tested the hypothesis that the deletion allele of the ACE gene is associated with insulin resistance. METHODS AND RESULTS: We related ACE genotype to components of the insulin-resistance syndrome in 103 non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) and 533 nondiabetic white subjects. NIDDM subjects with the DD genotype had significantly lower levels of specific insulin (DD 38.6, ID 57.1, and II 87.4 pmol.L-1 by ANOVA, P = .011). Non-insulin-treated subjects with the DD genotype had increased insulin sensitivity by HOMA % (DD 56.4%, II 29.4%, P = .027) and lower levels of des 31,32 proinsulin (DD 3.3, II 7.6 pmol.L-1, P = .012) compared with II subjects. There were no differences in prevalence of CHD or levels of blood pressure, serum lipids, or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity between the three ACE genotypes. In nondiabetic subjects there were no differences in insulin sensitivity, levels of insulin-like molecules, blood pressure, PAI-1, serum lipids, or CHD prevalence between the three ACE genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "BACKGROUND: The ACE gene has received substantial attention in recent years as candidate for a variety of diseases. The most common polymorphism in ACE gene is the Insertion/Deletion (I/D, rs4646994) polymorphism located on intron 16. AIM: We investigated the association between metabolic syndrome (MS) and the insertion (I) - deletion (D) polymorphisms in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene in south-east of Turkey. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and sixty subjects, with 101 cases of MS and 59 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included in the study. RESULTS: The frequency of ACE I/D polymorphism was found to be 49.5% for DD, 36.6% for ID, and 13.9% for II in the MSstudy group and 44.1% for DD, 42.4% for ID and 13.5% for II in the control group. Allele frequencies were found to be 0.68% for D and 0.32% for I allele in the study group with MS and 0.65% for D, 0.35% for I allele in the control group. The I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene, DD, ID, and II genotypes occurred with similar frequencies in the study group with MS and the control group with no significant differences (p<0.05). On applying one-way analysis of variance to different ACE gene polymorphic groups in patients with MS were not significantly associated to ACE gene polymorphism and waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, HDL, and LDL (p<0.05).

{"question": "Do ventricular arrhythmias in athletes subside over time?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Sudden death in athletes can occur during sport activities and is presumably related to ventricular arrhythmias. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term follow-up ofathletes with ventricular arrhythmias during an exercise test. METHODS: From a database of 56,462 athletes we identified 192 athletes (35 years old who had ventricular arrhythmias during an exercise test. Ninety athletes had > or =3 ventricular premature beats (VPB) (group A) and 102 athletes had ventricular couplets or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during an exercise test (group B). A control group of 92 athletesfrom without ventricular arrhythmias was randomly seleclted from the database (group C). Of the 192 athletes 39 returnied for a repeat exercise test after a mean follow-up period of 70 +/- 25 months and they constitute the study population. RESULTS: Twelve athletes from group A, 21 fromgroup B and 6 from group C returned for a repeat exercise test. The athletes reached a significantly lower peak heart rate during their follow-up exercise test (P = 0.001). More athletes were engaged in competitive sports during their initialexercise test than in the follow-up test (P = 0.021). Most of theathletes who had VPB and/orventricular couplets and/or NSVT during their initial exercise test had far fewer ventricular arrhythmias in the follow-up exercise test (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Athletes engaged in competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in non-competitive sports."]}
{"question": "Does ethnicity affect where people with cancer die?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Ageing is a growing issue for people from UK black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups. The health experiences of these groups are recognised as a 'tracer' to measure success in end of life patient-preferred outcomes that includes place of death (PoD). AIM: To examine patterns in PoD among BAME groups who died of cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mortality data for 93,375 cancer deaths of those aged >/=65 years in London from 2001-2010 were obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). Decedent's country of birth was used as a proxy for ethnicity. Linear regression examined trends in place of death across the eight ethnic groups and Poisson regression examined the association between country of birth and place of death. RESULTS: 76% decedents were born in the UK, followed by Ireland (5.9%), Europe(5.4%) and Caribbean(4.3%). Most deaths(52.5%) occurred in hospital, followed by home(18.7%). During the study period, deaths in hospital declined with an increase in home deaths; trend for time analysis for those born in UK(0.50%/yr[0.36-0.64%]p<0.001), Europe (1.00%/yr[0.64-1.30%]p<0.001), Asia(1.09%/yr[0.94-1.20%]p<0.001) and Caribbean(1.03%/yr[0.72-1.30%]p<0.001). However, time consistent gaps across the geographical groups remained. Following adjustment hospital deaths were more likely for those born in Asia(Proportion ratio(PR)1.12[95%CI1.08-1.15]p<0.001) and Africa(PR 1.11[95%CI1.07-1.16]p<0.001). Hospice deaths were less likely for those born in Asia(PR 0.73 [0.68-0.80] p<0.001), Africa (PR 0.83[95%CI0.74-0.93]p<0.001), and 'other' geographical regions (PR0.90[95% 0.82-0.98]p<0.001). Home deaths were less likely for those born in the Caribbean(PR0.91[95%CI 0.85-0.98]p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "BACKGROUND: This study investigated whether indices of social deprivation were related to the proportion of cancer patients who died at home. METHODS: Data were derived from death registrations for all cancer deaths 1985-1994 in England. Two indices of deprivation (Underprivileged Area Score (UPA), or Jarman, and Townsend scores) were calculated for each electoral ward; 1991 Census data were used. The scores use combinations of variables, including the percentage in overcrowded homes, the percentage of elderly people living alone, the percentage of one-parent families, etc. A high score indicates more deprivation. The main outcome measures were the proportion (in five and ten year averages) of cancer deaths which occurred at home, calculated for every electoral ward (with populations usually ranging from 5000 to 11,000). Spearman rho was used to test for correlations between the proportion of cancer deaths at home and deprivation score. Electoral wards were categorized by deprivation score into three groups of equal size and analysed over 10 years. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the relative association of different patient based and electoral ward variables with cancer death at home. p < 0.05 (two-tailed) was taken as significant. RESULTS: There were over 1.3 million death registrations from cancer in the 10 years. The proportion who died at home was 0.27, in hospital 0.47, and other setting 0.26. There were wide variations (0.05-0.75) in the proportion of people who died at home in different electoral wards. Small inverse correlations were found between the percentage who died at home and the UPA (-0.35; p < 0.001) and Townsend (-0.26; p < 0.001) scores. The correlations were greatest in North Thames (-0.63, UPA) and smallest in West Midlands (-0.20, UPA). The proportion of home deaths for the different bands of deprivation were: 0.30 (low deprivation), 0.27 (middle deprivation) and 0.24 (high deprivation). Plotting the trends over 10 years suggests no change in this relationship. Multiple regression analysis predicted several ward and patient characteristics and accounted for 30 per cent of the variation. Increased age (patient variable), Jarman score and ethnic minorities (both ward variables) were associated with fewer patients dying at home. Being male and having cancer of the digestive organs were associated with home death. CONCLUSION: There are wide variations in the percentage of cancer deaths at home in different electoral wards. Social factors are inversely correlated with home cancer death, and may explain part of this variation. Home care in deprived areas may be especially difficult to achieve.", "Religion, which is one of the most important sources of human identity, has so far hardly been taken into account in the clinic. In the largely secularized society of Germany, this has played a highly subordinate role. Currently, however, the development towards a multireligious society is emerging, which will also be reflected in everyday medical care. Disease and mortality in patients can affect different cultural-religious spheres. Although distinction between cultural and religious aspects is possible, it is not necessary for clinical practice. In the situation of oncological therapy, questions may arise which must be answered differently in the religions Christianity, Judaism and Islam and which should be taken into account when selecting therapy. The consideration of cultural-religious rules can intensify the patient's acceptance, but it can also impair it in case of disregard. Such peculiarities can be the separation into male and female spheres or the restriction of certain auxiliary substances or drugs (blood products, narcotics). Kubler-Ross's phase model is suitable for determining where cultural-religious sensitivities should be taken into account in the phases of disease and how cultural-religious offerings can benefit the course of therapy. Due to large individual, regional, cultural and confessional differences, no systematic catalogue of procedures can be provided here. However, knowledge of such differences, more sensitive interaction with patients and their families and cooperation with hospital pastors can strengthen the relationship of trust between doctor and patient and thus improve the conditions for successful oncological therapy. These aspects should not be underestimated when treating people of other faiths in Germany's secular society.", "Available evidence suggests that there may be qualitative differences in the natural history of PrCA by race. If this is true then additional etiologic research is needed to identify places in the causal chain where we can intervene to lower PrCA rates in AA men. South Carolina may prove to be a useful context in which to study prostate cancer etiology, because of the presence of unique environmental exposures. For example, soil selenium and cadmium concentrations unique to South Carolina might have a differential affect in the rural areas of the state where ground water use is more common and where AAs are more likely to live. These metals are important in terms of prostate metabolism and cancer. The possible interaction of geological factors with underlying biological factors such as metal transporter gene expression by race needs to be explored in South Carolina. Diet and exercise are consistently seen as possible primary prevention strategies for prostate and other cancers, as noted above. There may be very good reasons to intervene on diet and physical activity, but if the intention is to make a health claim with real, specific meaning for PrCA prevention and control then studies must be designed to test the effect of these modalities in rigorous ways at specific points in the natural history of prostate carcinogenesis. Nutrition and exercise programs need to be developed in South Carolina that are seen as acceptable by people at risk of PrCA; and they will need to focus on effective ways to prevent the development of PrCA, other cancers, and other health outcomes. Implementing diet and nutrition programs in rural parts of the state, possibly through schools or churches, offer benefit to both youth and adults alike. So, it would be possible, indeed it would be desirable, to create programs that may be used for research in one part of the population (e.g., men with PrCA), but are equally beneficial for others (e.g., their spouses and children). Organizing studies that can focus on promising new areas of research and changing the paradigms under which the research community currently operates probably will require re-conceptualizing research strategies employing methods that entail CBPR approaches. Because much of South Carolina's African-American population resides in rural parts of the state, outreach presents a challenge for both researchers and clinicians. Individuals living in rural areas are more likely than urban residents to live in poverty, report poorer health status, and not have private health insurance. Americans living in rural areas face disparities in access to basic public health services compared to those living in metropolitan areas. In very practical ways, local public health departments are absent in many rural communities, and rural hospitals continue to close, removing needed services. Closing of public hospitals has been shown to significantly increase the percentage of people without a primary health care provider as well as the percentage of people denied care. Public health departments are of particular importance to rural residents as they serve as the main avenue for public health and clinical care for this group. Issues such as access to care, lack of frequent physician's visits and quality of medical care have a negative impact on outcomes for men with PrCA, particularly in relationship to staging. If better outcomes are to be achieved in South Carolina, then more must be done to reach the community and provide better access to care in more rural areas of the state. Small media interventions, such as those presented in churches and barbershops may be an effective means for reaching the rural AA population. Our ability to reach out to and interact with the high-risk pockets in the state will be necessary for screening, treatment, and research (which, if conducted competently, will affect screening efficacy, treatment effectiveness, and primary prevention). It is believed that currently available decision-making materials for PrCA screening may not be appropriate due to socioeconomic as well as health literacy differences present in all male groups. It is unclear whether men in the lower socioeconomic groups are given appropriate information that allows them to make educated, informed decisions around PrCA screenings. Considering the number of males in the lower socioeconomic groups in South Carolina and the large AA male population, research evaluating the appropriateness of the existing materials could have an impact --both within the state and in national efforts. Patient education is a promising strategy, but educating the patient in the context of his family seems to be a more effective strategy for this population. Family networks and faith-based networks offer a strong support base for the patient when making health-related decisions, particularly for the African-American male. In collaboration with the SCCDCN, the South Carolina Cancer Alliance (SCCA) is currently developing a proposal to create a decision guide for prostate screening that is targeted toward the African-American male. The SCCA plans to pilot test new, culturally appropriate materials in the Low Country of South Carolina because of its comparatively large African-American population and its high rate of residential stability. South Carolina is one of only a few states to adopt expanded Medicaid coverage for the treatment of breast cancer. PrCA needs to receive equal recognition. This year alone in South Carolina 3,290 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 630 will die from the disease. Likewise, the American Cancer Society estimated 3,770 men in South Carolina would be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 440 will die from the disease in 2006. The 1 million dollars set aside in South Carolina budget by lawmakers for treatment of breast and cervical cancer patients makes no mention of prostate cancer, which is an unfair omission. Finally, there currently exists a number of high-quality PrCA treatment, research, and referral resources in the state. Collaborations across agencies, institutes and organizations throughout South Carolina would prove to be beneficial in reaching the most rural (and therefore hardest to reach) populations. Collaborative arrangements will be pursued to increase positive outcomes and better futures for South Carolinians.", "Data on over a thousand Gambian children have been analysed to examine factors influencing their antibody levels following immunization with hepatitis B vaccine administered during the first year of life. The dominant effect was the time between the last dose of vaccine and taking the blood sample. There was considerable variation in vaccine response by area of residence which could not be explained by any other factor. The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) status of the mother and the age at vaccination did not appear to have an effect, but there was some indication that a delay in receiving the second dose of vaccine led to a marginally lower response."]}
{"question": "The Omega-3 Index: a new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Low intakes or blood levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA + DHA) are independently associated with increased risk of death from coronary heart disease (CHD). In randomized secondary prevention trials, fish or fish oil have been demonstrated to reduce total and CHD mortality at intakes of about 1 g/day. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid (FA) composition reflects long-term intake of EPA + DHA. We propose that the RBC EPA + DHA (hereafter called the Omega-3 Index) be considered a new risk factor for death from CHD. METHODS: We conducted clinical and laboratory experiments to generate data necessary for the validation of the Omega-3 Index as a CHD risk predictor. The relationship between this putative marker and risk for CHD death, especially sudden cardiac death (SCD), was then evaluated in several published primary and secondary prevention studies. RESULTS: The Omega-3 Index was inversely associated with risk for CHD mortality. An Omega-3 Index of > or = 8% was associated with the greatest cardioprotection, whereas an index of < or = 4% was associated with the least. CONCLUSION: The Omega-3 Index may represent a novel, physiologically relevant, easily modified, independent, and graded risk factor for death from CHD that could have significant clinical utility.", "Blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids reflect the interplay of metabolism and the intake of omega-3-rich foods (eg, oily fish). Multiple lines of evidence link reduced tissue and/or blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids, as reflected in the erythrocyte eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid level (ie, the omega-3 index), with increased risk for coronary heart disease, especially sudden cardiac death. The purpose of this review is to examine the extent to which biomarkers like the omega-3 index qualify as coronary heart disease risk markers and/or risk factors based on new criteria from the American Heart Association and older guidelines proposed in 1965 by Sir Austin Bradford Hill. These standards include consistency, strength of association, biological plausibility, coherence, dose-response relationship, clinical utility, cost effectiveness, and prospective validation. The omega-3 index appears to fulfill many of the requirements for a risk marker and, more importantly, for a risk factor.", "A reduced risk of fatal coronary artery disease has been associated with a high intake of (n-3) fatty acids (FA) and a direct cardioprotective effect by their incorporation into myocardial cells has been suggested. Based on these observations, the omega-3 index (eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid in cell membranes of RBC expressed as percent of total FA) has been suggested as a new risk marker for cardiac death. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the omega-3 index as a prognostic risk marker following hospitalization with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The omega-3 index was measured at admission in 460 patients with an ACS as defined by Troponin-T (TnT) > or = 0.02 microg/L. During a 2-y follow-up, recurrent myocardial infarctions (MI) (defined as TnT > 0.05 microg/L with a typical MI presentation) and cardiac and all-cause mortality were registered. Cox regression analyses were used to relate the risk of new events to the quartiles of the omega-3 index at inclusion. After correction for age, sex, previous heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, brain natriuretic peptide, creatinine, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerol, homocysteine, BMI, and medication, there was no significant reduction in risk for all-cause mortality, cardiac death, or MI with increasing values of the index. In conclusion, we could not confirm the omega-3 index as a useful prognostic risk marker following an ACS.", "The omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) found in fish and fish oils (eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, EPA and DHA) have been reported to have a variety of beneficial effects in cardiovascular diseases. Ecological and prospective cohort studies as well as randomized, controlled trials have supported the view that the effects of these FAs are clinically relevant. They operate via several mechanisms, all beginning with the incorporation of EPA and DHA into cell membranes. From here, these omega-3 FA alter membrane physical characteristics and the activity of membrane-bound proteins, and once released by intracellular phospholipases, can interact with ion channels, be converted into a wide variety of bioactive eicosanoids, and serve as ligands for several nuclear transcription factors thereby altering gene expression. In as much as blood levels are a strong reflection of dietary intake, it is proposed that an omega-3 FA biomarker, the omega-3 index (erythrocyte EPA+DHA) be considered at least a marker, if not a risk factor, for coronary heart disease, especially sudden cardiac death. The omega-3 index fulfils many of the requirements for a risk factor including consistent epidemiological evidence, a plausible mechanism of action, a reproducible assay, independence from classical risk factors, modifiability, and most importantly, the demonstration that raising tissue levels will reduce risk for cardiac events. For these and a number of other reasons, the omega-3 index compares very favourably with other risk factors for sudden cardiac death.", "In previous studies, low blood levels of n-3 fatty acids (FA) have been associated with increased risk of cardiac death, and the omega-3 index (red blood cell (RBC) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) expressed as weight percentage of total FA) has recently been proposed as a new risk factor for death from coronary artery disease, especially following sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). As blood samples often haven been harvested after the event, the aim of our study was to evaluate the stability of RBC fatty acids following SCA. The total FA profile, including the omega-3 index, was measured three times during the first 48 h in 25 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), in 15 patients with a myocardial infarction (MI) without SCA and in 5 healthy subjects. We could not demonstrate significant changes in the FA measurements in any of the groups, this also applied to the omega-6/omega-3 ratio and the arachidonic acid (AA)/EPA ratio. Furthermore, we compared the omega-3 index in 14 OHCA-patients suffering their first MI with that of 185 first-time MI-patients without SCA; mean values being 4.59% and 6.48%, respectively (p = 0.002). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, a 1% increase of the omega-3 index was associated with a 58% (95% CI: 0.25-0.76%) reduction in risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF). In conclusion, the omega-3 index remained stable after an event of SCA and predicted the risk of VF."]}
{"question": "Do cytokine concentrations in pancreatic juice predict the presence of pancreatic diseases?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cytokine concentration in pancreatic juice of patients with pancreatic disease is unknown. Secretin stimulation allows endoscopic collection of pancreatic juice secreted into the duodenum. We aimed to evaluate the cytokine concentrations in pancreatic juice of patients with abdominal pain to discriminate presence from absence of pancreatic disease. METHODS: From January 2003-December 2004, consecutive patients with abdominal pain compatible with pancreatic origin were enrolled. Patients underwent upper endoscopy. Intravenous secretin (0.2 mug/kg) was given immediately before scope intubation. Pancreatic juice collected from the duodenum was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until assays were performed. Pancreatic juice levels of interleukin-8, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 were measured by modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The final diagnosis was made by the primary gastroenterologist on the basis of medical history; laboratory, endoscopic, and imaging studies; and clinical follow-up. Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of 130 patients screened, 118 met the inclusion criteria. Multivariate analysis revealed that only interleukin-8 was able to discriminate between normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis (P = .011), pancreatic cancer (P = .044), and the presence of pancreatic diseases (P = .007). Individual cytokine concentrations were not significantly different in chronic pancreatitis compared with pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine levels can be measured in pancreatic juice obtained from the duodenum without direct cannulation of the pancreatic duct. Interleukin-8 concentration in pancreatic juice can be used to discriminate between normal pancreas and patients with pancreatic disease. This is a relatively simple and noninvasive method to aid in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases.", "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to establish a minimally invasive and simple screening test for detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using duodenal juice (DJ). METHODS: Duodenal juice was collected prospectively before endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in 46 patients. A protease inhibitor was not added to the samples collected during the initial 2.5 minutes but was added in the latter 2.5 minutes. Thereafter, secretin was administered intravenously, and DJ was subsequently collected for additional 10 minutes. The sensitivities of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), S100 calcium-binding protein P (S100P), and interleukin 8 in DJ and pancreatic juice were assessed. RESULTS: There were 30 patients with PDAC and 16 with benign lesions. It was possible to collect an adequate amount of DJ without secretin administration. In the PDAC group, CEA concentrations in DJ were significantly higher than those in the benign group, even without the use of a protease inhibitor. S100P levels in DJ in the PDAC group were significantly higher than those in the benign group in the presence of the protease inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Duodenal juice collection during routine upper endoscopy and assessments of CEA and S100P in DJ might become a useful screening test for detection of PDAC."]}
{"question": "Does the sex of acute stroke patients influence the effectiveness of rt-PA?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Women have been reported to show more frequent recanalization and better recovery after intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment for acute stroke compared with men. To investigate this we studied a series of stroke patients receiving IV rt-PA and undergoing acute transcranial doppler (TCD) examination. METHODS: Acute stroke patients received IV rt-PA and had acute TCD examination within 4 hours of symptom onset at 4 major stroke centers. TCD findings were interpreted using the Thrombolysis in Brain Ischemia (TIBI) flow grading system. The recanalization rates, and poor 3-month outcomes (modified Rankin scale >2) of men and women were compared using the chi-square test. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess sex as a predictor of recanalization and poor 3-month outcome after controlling for age, baseline NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), time to treatment, hypertension, and blood glucose. RESULTS: 369 patients had TCD examinations before or during IV rt-PA treatment. The 199 (53.9%) men and 170 (46.1%) women had mean ages of 67 +/- 13 and 70 +/- 14 years, respectively. The sexes did not differ significantly in baseline stroke severity, time to TCD examination, or time to thrombolysis. Of the men, 68 (34.2%) had complete recanalization, 58 (29.1%) had partial recanalization, and 73 (36.6%) had no recanalization. Of the women, 53 (31.2%) had complete recanalization, 46 (27%) had partial recanalization, and 71 (41.8%) had no recanalization (p = 0.6). Multiple regression analyses showed no difference between the sexes in recanalization rate, time to recanalization, or clinical outcome at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Data from CLOTBUST trial Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01240356.", "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sex is associated with clinical outcome in stroke. The present study aimed to determine the effect of sex on efficacy of dual antiplatelet (DAPT) versus alteplase in ischemic stroke based on Antiplatelet versus recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (R-tPA) for Acute Mild Ischemic Stroke (ARAMIS) trial. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of the ARAMIS study, eligible patients aged 18 years or older with minor nondisabling stroke who received dual antiplatelet therapy or intravenous alteplase within 4.5 h of stroke onset were divided into two groups: men and women. The primary endpoint was an excellent functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-1 at 90 days. Binary logistic regression analyses and generalized linear models were used. RESULTS: Of the 719 patients who completed the study, 31% (223) were women, and 69% (496) were men. There were no significant sex differences in excellent functional outcome (unadjusted p = 0.304 for men and p = 0.993 for women; adjusted p = 0.376 for men and p = 0.918 for women) and favorable functional outcome (mRS score of 0-2; unadjusted p = 0.968 for men and p = 0.881 for women; adjusted p = 0.824 for men and p = 0.881 for women). But for the secondary outcomes, compared with alteplase, DAPT was associated with a significantly decreased proportion of early neurological deterioration within 24 h in men unadjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.440 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.221-0.878]; p = 0.020; adjusted OR = 0.436 [95% CI, 0.216-0.877]; p = 0.020, but not in women [unadjusted OR = 0.636 (95% CI, 0.175-2.319), p = 0.490; adjusted OR = 0.687 (95% CI, 0.181-2.609), p = 0.581]. For the safety outcomes, compared with the DAPT group, alteplase was associated with a significantly increased proportion of any bleeding events in men [unadjusted OR = 3.110 (95% CI, 1.103-8.770); p = 0.032], but not in women [unadjusted OR = 5.333 (95% CI, 0.613-46.407), p = 0.129; adjusted OR = 5.394 (95% CI, 0.592-49.112), p = 0.135]. CONCLUSION: Sex did not influence the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy versus intravenous alteplase in minor nondisabling stroke, but more early neurological deterioration and bleeding events occurred in men who received alteplase.", "BACKGROUND: There are conflicting results regarding the effect of intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) stroke treatment between men and women. Studies evaluating the impact of sex differences on functional outcome in relation to different age groups are nonexistent. AIM: The objective of the study is to examine the influence of sex differences in relation to age on the prognosis after IV rtPA treatment in acute stroke patients. METHODS: In this cohort study, 887 patients with acute ischemic stroke were treated with rtPA. Functional outcome after 3 months was determined with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Good outcome was defined as an mRS score of 2 or lower. Age was stratified in decades (41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and >80 years). Multivariable analyses were performed with adjustment for age, sex, stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]), and stroke subtype (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment). RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of the patients were men. The mean age was 67.4 (men) and 72.0 (women) years. Fifty-six percent of the men and 45% of the women had a favorable outcome (P = .001). After adjustment for NIHSS score and stroke subtype, the women had a better outcome in the age group 51-60 years compared with men (odds ratio [OR] .38, 95% confidence interval [CI] .15-.96). In the age group >80 years, men had a better outcome than women (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.21-5.96). There were no significant differences in the other age groups. CONCLUSION: Men and women have different prognoses after IV rtPA treatment for acute ischemic stroke, which also depends on age. Women in middle age appear to have a better outcome than men, whereas at a more advanced age men appear to have a better outcome than women.", "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Women are more likely to have a worse outcome after an acute stroke than men. Some studies have suggested that women also benefit less from intravenous thrombolysis after an acute ischemic stroke, but others found no sex differences in safety and efficacy. We aimed to evaluate differences in 3-month outcome between sexes in intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator-treated patients registered in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register. METHODS: A total of 45 079 patients treated with intravenous alteplase were recorded from 2002 to 2011. Main outcome measures were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2), and mortality at 3 months. RESULTS: Among 25 777 (57.2%) men and 19 302 (42.8%) women, we found no difference in the rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (P=0.13), a significantly higher likelihood of functional independence at 3 months in men (P<0.0001) and a higher mortality in women when compared with men (P<0.00001). After adjustment for confounding variables, we did not observe any difference between sexes in functional outcome (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.09; P=0.39), whereas male sex was related to a higher risk of mortality (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.29; P=0.00003) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (odds ratio, 1.25, 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.51; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "BACKGROUND: Previous research has indicated that women and blacks have worse outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Little research has been done to investigate the combined influence of race and gender in the presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with AIS. We sought to determine the association of race and gender on initial stroke severity, thrombolysis, and functional outcome after AIS. METHODS: AIS patients who presented to 2 academic medical centers in the United States (2004-2011) were identified through prospective registries. In-hospital strokes were excluded. Stroke severity, measured by admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), neurologic deterioration (defined by a >/=2-point increase in NIHSS score), and functional outcome at discharge, measured by the modified Rankin Scale, were investigated. These outcomes were compared across race/gender groups. A subanalysis was conducted to assess race/gender differences in exclusion criteria for tPA. RESULTS: Of the 4925 patients included in this study, 2346 (47.6%) were women and 2310 (46.9%) were black. White women had the highest median NIHSS score on admission (8), whereas white men had the lowest median NIHSS score on admission (6). There were no differences in outcomes between black men and white men. A smaller percentage of black women than white women were treated with tPA (27.6% versus 36.6%, P < .0001), partially because of a greater proportion of white women presenting within 3 hours (51% versus 45.5%, P = .0005). Black women had decreased odds of poor functional outcome relative to white women (odds ratio [OR] = .85, 95% confidence interval [CI] .72-1.00), but after adjustment for baseline differences in age, NIHSS, and tPA use, this association was no longer significant (OR = 1.2, 95% CI .92-1.46, P = .22). Black women with an NIHSS score less than 7 on admission were at lower odds of receiving tPA than the other race/gender groups, even after adjusting for arriving within 3 hours and admission glucose (OR = .66, 95% CI .44-.99, P = .0433). CONCLUSION: Race and gender were not significantly associated with short-term outcome, although black women were significantly less likely to be treated with tPA. Black women had more tPA exclusions than any other group. The primary reason for tPA exclusion in this study was not arriving within 3 hours of stroke symptom onset. Given the growth in incident strokes projected in minority groups in the next 4 decades, identifying factors that contribute to black women not arriving to the emergency department in time are of great importance."]}
{"question": "Diabetes mellitus among Swedish art glass workers--an effect of arsenic exposure?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to search for evidence of an association between occupational arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus, as implied by the relation of this disease to arsenic in drinking water in a recent study from Taiwan. METHODS: A case-referent analysis on death records of 5498 individuals in the art glass producing part of southeastern Sweden was performed. Out of all the enrolled subjects, 888 were glass workers. According to occupational title, glassblowers, foundry workers, and unspecified workers were regarded as potentially exposed to arsenic. Persons with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus either as an underlying or contributing cause of death were considered cases. Referents were decedents without any indication of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. RESULTS: A slightly elevated risk [Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (MH-OR) 1.2, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.82-1.8] was found for diabetes mellitus among the glassworks employees, especially in combination with cardiovascular disease (MH-OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.81-2.3). For the glassblowers, other foundry workers and unspecified glassworkers probably exposed to arsenic, the M-H odds ratio was 1.4 (95% CI 0.92-2.2). Unspecified glass workers, who probably included persons with high exposure, carried the higher risk (MH-OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.8). CONCLUSIONS: The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding."]}

It has been shown to predict long-term clinical outcomes in patients with left main or multi-vessel disease and recently also in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary PCI. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the syntax score is associated with short-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). METHODS: Syntax score was determined in 90 consecutive patients (mean age 54.2+/-11.6) of STEMI undergoing primary PCI. Outcomes were stratified according to syntax score groups: SX low </=15 (n=33), SX mid 16-22 (n=30), and SX high >/=23 (n=27). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30 days. Secondary endpoints were nonfatal major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of any repeat revascularization, acute coronary syndrome, and stroke at 30 days in patients discharged alive. RESULTS: Mortality at 30 days was higher in the SX high group compared to the SX mid and SX low group (18.5% vs 3.3% p=0.011), MACE at 30 days was higher in SX high group compared to SX mid and SX low group (48.1% vs 16.6% vs 9.1%, p=0.001).

But its prognostic value for patients with acute coronary syndrome remains unknown. AIM: To evaluate whether SxS could predict in-hospital outcomes for patients admitted with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). METHODS: The study included 538 patients with STEMI who underwent pPCI between January 2010 and December 2012. The patients were divided into two groups: low SxS (< 22) and high SxS (> 22). The SxS of all patients was calculated from aninitial angiogram and TIMI flow grade of infarct related artery was calculated after pPCI. Left ventricular systolic functions of the patients were evaluated with an echocardiogram in the following week. The rates of reinfarction and mortality during hospitalisation were obtained from the medical records of our hospital. RESULTS: The high SxS group had more no-reflow (41% and 25.1%, p < 0.001, respectively), lower ejection fraction (38.2 +/- 7.5% and 44.6 +/- 8.8%, p < 0.001, respectively), and greater rates of re-infarction (9.5% and 7.3%, p = 0.037, respectively) and mortality (0.9% and 0.2%, p = 0.021, respectively) during hospitalisation compared to the low SxS group. On multivariate logistic regression analysis including clinical variables, SxS was an independent predictor of no-reflow (OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.032-1.133, p = 0.001).

We aimed to examine whether a high SXscore will determine in-hospital clinical outcomes in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS: A total of 646 (mean age 56.1 +/- 12.5; 516 males, 130 females) patients with STEMI undergoing a primary percutaneous coronary intervention were evaluated prospectively. The study population was divided into tertiles based on the SXscore values. A high SXscore (n=196) was defined as a value in the third tertile (>21.75), and a low SXscore (n=450) was defined as a value in the lower two tertiles (</=21.75). Patients were followed up for in-hospital clinical outcomes. RESULTS: In-hospital cardiovascular mortality occurred more in the high SXscore group than in the low SXscore group (10.7 and 2.4%, respectively, P<0.001). In a receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, an SXscore value of 21.75 was identified as an effective cut point in STEMI for in-hospital cardiovascular mortality (area under curve=0.75, 95% confidence interval: 0.66-0.83, P<0.001). An SXscore value of more than 21.75 yielded a sensitivity of 66% and a specificity of 71.5%.

CONCLUSIONS: Major complications were observed in 36 (2.8%) patients, death in 42 (3.3%) patients, and stent thrombosis in 24 (1.9%) patients. The area under the curves for SYNTAX and cul-SS for predicting primary outcomes is 0.64 and 0.68 (p = 0.026), respectively.

METHODS: The study included 477 patients with STEMI who underwent pPCI between October 2010 and May 2014. SYNTAX Score II and MBG were determined in all patients. Myocardial blush grade were divided into MBG 0/1 (poor myocardial perfusion) and MBG 2/3 (normal myocardial perfusion). Patients were divided into three tertiles: SS-IIlow (\uffe1 20), SS-IIintermediate (20-26) and SS-IIhigh (>/= 26). RESULTS: Compared with the SS-IIintermediate and SS-IIlow tertiles, the SS-IIhigh tertile had more MBG 0/1 (46.1%, 32.1% and 21.8%, p < 0.001, respectively). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, SS-II was an independent predictor of MBG 0/1 (hazard ratio 1.084, 95% confidence interval 1.050-1.119, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified SS-II > 24 as the best cut-off value predicting MBG 0/1 (sensitivity of 66%, specificity of 54%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of osseous microstructural variables including bone volumetric density (BV/TV) of 39 biopsies from the maxillary alveolar bone was performed by micro-CT. Conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry of 10 bone biopsies was performed by optic microscopy (OM) and low-vacuum surface electronic microscopy (SEM). Percentages of bone between micro-CT and conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry were compared. RESULTS: Significant positive correlations were observed between BV/TV and the percentage of bone (%Bone) analyzed by SEM (r = 0.933, P < 0.001), by toluidine blue staining OM (r = 0.950, P < 0.001) and by dark field OM (r = 0.667, P = 0.05). The high positive correlation coefficient between BV/TV and trabecular thickness illustrates that a value of BV/TV upper than 50% squares with a bone presenting most of their trabecules thicker than 0.2 mm. The high negative correlation between BV/TV and trabecular separation shows that values of BV/TV upper than 50% squares with a bone presenting most of their trabecules separated less than 0.3 mm each other.

Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scans, performed after 1, 4, and 12 weeks of surgery, were to assess changes in ridge height at buccal and palatal side, in ridge width and in micromorphological parameters. Histological analysis accessed socket microarchitecture. The results showed that RCS had stable mechanical properties and morphologic features that provided a reliable physical support for ARP. Dimensional changes in treatment group revealed significantly greater vertical height at buccal (5.32 [3.37, 7.26] mm, p < .0001) and palatal (4.37 [2.66, 6.09] mm, p < .0001) side, and horizontal width at the maxilla (0.16 [0.04, 0.28] mm, p < .01) and mandible (0.33 [0.11, 0.54] mm, p < .01) than those in sham operation group after 12 weeks. The treatment group had advantage than positive group in vertical height preservation, quantitatively. The order and density of bone trabeculae were improved in treatment group.

CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we report an overall improvement and high technical success rate for peripherial PTA. The use of hydrophilic guidewires made significant difference to the technical success rate of PTA, especially in occlusion and more complicated lesions.", "Technical success of endovascular measures in the femoropopliteal region has increased since the introduction of new technology (hydrophilic guide-wires, stents, stent grafts) in the last decade to rates of more than 90%. If the initial revascularization--even of long segment occlusions--is successful, the modern armamentarium of interventional radiology enables to keep the vessel open acutely. Evidence, that the immediate success of revascularization leads to a continuous improvement of the clinical symptoms, measured by clinically relevant end points (e.g. improvement of walking distance, increase of limb salvage, increase of survival), has yet to be shown. Several prospective randomized trials demonstrated improvement of walking distance after one year follow-up, but not after two years follow-up in patients with chronic femoropopliteal obstructions, who were treated with PTA compared to walking exercise only. The only two prospective randomized trials comparing vascular surgery and endovascular therapy for femoropopliteal obstructions could not demonstrate any advantage of one of the two modalities in patients with claudication or critical ischemia. The transatlantic consensus document (TASC) recommends PTA as therapy of choice in the femoropopliteal arteries only for single stenosis < 3 cm and does not recommend primary stenting. In order to evaluate endovascular therapy in the femoropopliteal region outcome studies are needed, which carefully assess clinically relevant end points like improvement of walking distance, limb salvage, and survival, but also disease specific quality of life evaluations. Several meta-analyses, performed in recent years, have demonstrated that endovascular therapy has a definite role in the femoropopliteal segment. However, the particular role has to be evaluated for the individual clinical case in the light of case-specific findings and symptoms."]}
{"question": "Does frozen section alter surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Frozen section (FS) evaluation during thyroid surgery is often used to guide intraoperative management. We sought to determine the utility of FS in patients undergoing thyroidectomy for multinodular thyroid disease. METHODS: From May 1994 through November 2004, 236 patients with multinodular goiter underwent thyroidectomy at our institution. Patient data were retrospectively analyzed to see if a frozen section was performed during the procedure and whether it changed the patient's outcome. RESULTS: Of the 236 patients, 135 (57%) had intra-operative FS. There were no differences between patients who had FS analysis and those who did not with regard to age, gender, and the incidence of malignancy. Of the patients who had FS, 4/135 (3%) were subsequently diagnosed with thyroid cancer on permanent histology. Three of these FS were misread as benign. Therefore, the sensitivity of FS for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer was only 25%. Importantly, in none of the 135 patients did FS alter the intraoperative management. CONCLUSION: While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "BACKGROUND: The value of routine frozen section examination for intraoperative diagnosis of thyroid cancer and determination of extent of thyroidectomy is controversial and needs to be evaluated on an institution to institution basis. METHODS: A prospective evaluation of 76 patients with nodular thyroid disease who had an adequate fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) underwent thyroidectomy with routine thyroid frozen section examination. A direct comparison of FNAB and frozen section examination, along with a cost benefit analysis of frozen section examination, was completed. RESULTS: The thyroid pathology was carcinoma in 24, follicular adenoma in 24, multinodular goiter in 24, thyroiditis in 3, and a cyst in 1 patient. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of frozen section examination were 93%, 100%, and 97%, respectively, compared with 88%, 89%, and 91% for FNAB (P > 0.05). Diagnosis was deferred in 38 patients (50%) in whom frozen section examination showed a follicular neoplasm. One to 6 frozen section examinations were obtained per patient with alteration in intraoperative management in only 2 patients (3%) at a charge of $246 to $606 per patient and a total charge of $26,040. CONCLUSION: In patients with an adequate FNAB, frozen section examination rarely affected intraoperative decision making in thyroid surgery and its routine use was not cost effective."]}
{"question": "Is non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis possible by duplex Doppler ultrasonography?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND AIM: Esophageal varices are present in 30% to 40% of patients in compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) and in 60% to 85% of patients in decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh classes B and C). It is important to identify patients with compensated cirrhosis at risk for esophageal varix development. We evaluated the accuracy of a duplex Doppler ultrasonographic index for predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) by using endoscopy as the reference standard. METHODS: Fifty-six enrolled patients underwent duplex Doppler ultrasonography followed by screening endoscopy. Mean portal vein velocity (PVV), splenic index (SI), splenoportal index (SPI), hepatic and splenic arterial resistive, and pulsatility indices (hepatic artery resistive index [HARI], hepatic artery pulsatility index [HAPI], splenic artery resistive index [SARI], splenic artery pulsatility index [SAPI]) were recorded. Univariate logistic regression analysis was followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve construction for the indices that were significant. RESULTS: The indices HARI, HAPI, SARI, SAPI were not helpful (p > 0.05). Mean PVV, SI, and SPI were all predictive of the presence of esophageal varices (p < 0.05) and SPI was found to be the most accurate parameter. Of the various cut-off levels of SPI evaluated, a cut-off value of SPI at 5.0, offered the highest diagnostic accuracy (88%). For the 28 patients with SPI <5.0, the absence of esophageal varices in 27 of them could be correctly diagnosed using only SPI without invasive screening endoscopy, with high negative predictive value (96%) and sensitivity (96%). Of the remaining 28 patients with SPI >/=5.0, presence of esophageal varices could be similarly correctly diagnosed in 22 of them by using SPI without screening endoscopy, with high positive predictive value (79%) and specificity (82%). CONCLUSION: The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis."]}
{"question": "Can dogs prime autistic children for therapy?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Canine-assisted therapy has been receiving growing attention as a means of aiding children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, only limited studies have been done and a great deal of literature related to this intervention is anecdotal. The present study aims at providing additional quantitative evidence on the potential of dogs to positively modulate the behavior of children with ASD. SETTINGS/LOCATION, SUBJECTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: A 12-year-old boy diagnosed with ASD was exposed, at his usual treatment location (the Portuguese Association for Developmental Disorders and Autism at Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal), to the following treatment conditions: (1) one-to-one structured activities with a therapist assisted by a certified therapy dog, and (2) one-to-one structured activities with the same therapist alone (as a control). To accurately assess differences in the behavior of the participant between these treatment conditions, the therapist followed a strict research protocol. The behavior of the participant was continuously video-recorded during both treatment conditions for further analysis and comparison. Treatment outcomes: In the presence of the dog, the participant exhibited more frequent and longer durations of positive behaviors (such as smiling and positive physical contacting) as well as less frequent and shorter durations of negative behaviors (such as aggressive manifestations). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions."]}
{"question": "Risk factors for avascular necrosis of bone in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: is there a role for antiphospholipid antibodies?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Avascular necrosis of bone (AVN) is a well known complication in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of antiphospholipid antibody status (IgM and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant) with adjustment for corticosteroid use as risk factors for the development of AVN. METHODS: A cohort of 265 patients receiving long term follow up in our SLE clinic from 1978 to 1998 was analysed. Patients with AVN complications were detected and then matched for age, sex, ethnicity, duration of disease, and organ disease with two other patients with SLE. A further 31 patients were chosen at random for the analysis. RESULTS: Eleven patients had AVN, giving a point prevalence of 4%. There were no significant differences demonstrable in the presence of individual antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) or their combination between the group with AVN or the two control groups. CONCLUSION: Incorporating an adjustment for corticosteroid use we were unable to show a link between the presence of aPL and the development of AVN in patients with SLE.", "Of a total of 800 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 37 were found to have developed avascular necrosis of bone (4.6%). Routine radiological screening of all joints was not performed and these 37 represented symptomatic patients only. Twenty-seven of these were positive for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) (73%). Both aPL positive and aPL negative patients had received large doses of oral steroids. The frequency of vasculitis and livedo reticularis, as well as arterial thrombosis was higher in the aPL positive group, but this did not reach statistical significance, perhaps because of the small numbers of patients involved. Although the difference in the frequency of thrombocytopenia was more marked in the aPL positive group (p < 0.08), once again, this was not statistically significant at the 5% level. Since the prevalence of aPL positivity in the general lupus population is about 30-40%, the presence of the aPL may be associated with an increased tendency to develop avascular necrosis. This is supported by recent reports of avascular necrosis occurring in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome in the absence of previous steroid administration.", "We determined prospectively the prevalence of avascular osteonecrosis (AON) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both lower limbs in a group of 40 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and correlated the results with their serum antiphospholipid antibody (APL Ab) status and their glucocorticoid (GC) intake. APL Ab were detected by anticardiolipin ELISA and by lupus anticoagulant assays. Cumulated prednisolone doses were computed by chart review. The prevalence of AON was 37.5%, with most patients being asymptomatic despite involvement of multiple sites. The number of epiphyseal, metaphyseal and diaphyseal AON sites per patient did not differ between APL Ab-positive and APL Ab-negative patients nor between patients with high and low APL Ab titres. By contrast, a striking correlation was found between the prevalence and severity of AON and GC therapy. In conclusion, this prospective MRI study indicates that the prevalence of AON in SLE patients correlates strongly with GC therapy, but not with APL Ab status.", "OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ION) is a common complication of SLE associated with CS therapy. Although the pathogenesis of ION involves local bone ischaemia favoured by thrombophilia, the involvement of aPL in lupus ION remains to be elucidated. We have previously reported the aPL score (aPL-S) as a quantitative marker of aPL and the development of thrombotic events in autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was to identify the impact of aPL on the development of ION using aPL-S. METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective study comprising 88 consecutive SLE patients who underwent MRI of the hip joints from January 2000 to March 2017. Baseline characteristics, pharmacotherapy and total hip arthroplasty performed during follow-up were evaluated. RESULTS: The presence of ION was confirmed by MRI scan in 38 patients (43.1%). Male gender, positivity of any aPL, aPL-S, high aPL-S (>/=30) and high dose of CS were identified as risk factors for ION by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed high aPL-S (odds ratio 5.12, 95% CI 1.18-29.79) and use of high-dose CS (odds ratio 10.25, 95% CI 3.00-48.38) as independent variables. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with high aPL-S received total hip arthroplasty more frequently than those without aPL (P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: We newly identified high aPL-S as an important risk factor for ION development in SLE, suggesting the involvement of aPL-induced coagulopathy in the pathophysiology of lupus ION.", "Osteonecrosis (ON), or avascular necrosis of bone, has been related to decreased blood flow to the bone.

We describe the case of a previously healthy young male with no history of corticosteroid therapy, who developed ON initially on the femoral head, and later on the humeral head with high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), beta-2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies and positive lupus anticoagulant. The association between primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) and ON is controversial and few cases without other risk factors have been described.

{"question": "Is plate clearing a risk factor for obesity?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: Identifying eating behaviors which contribute to excess weight gain will inform obesity prevention strategies. A tendency to clear one's plate when eating may be a risk factor for obesity in an environment where food is plentiful. Whether plate clearing is associated with increased body weight in a cohort of US participants was examined. METHODS: Nine hundred and ninety-three US adults (60% male, 80% American European, mean age=31 years) completed self-report measures of habitual plate clearing together with behavioral and demographic characteristics known to be associated with obesity. RESULTS: Plate clearing tendencies were positively associated with BMI and remained so after accounting for a large number of other demographic and behavioral predictors of BMI in analyses (beta=0.18, 95% CIs=0.07, 0.29, P<0.001); an increased tendency to plate clear was associated with a significantly higher body weight. CONCLUSIONS: The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "The association of obesity with changes in bone mass is not clear. Obese individuals tend to have an increased bone mineral density, but other studies have shown that obesity is a major risk factor for fractures. The mechanisms of bone response during a weight loss therapy as well as the possible osteoprotective effect of exercise should be analyzed. The aim of this study was to test the effects of a weight-loss program based on the combination of caloric restriction and/or a mixed training protocol on different parameters of bone morphology and functionality in a DIO rat model. Three stages were established over a 21-week period (obesity induction 0-12 w, weight loss intervention 12-15 w, weight maintenance intervention 15-21 w) in 88 male Sprague Dawley rats. Bone microarchitecture, total mineral and elemental composition, and bone metabolism parameters were assessed. Weight loss interventions were associated to healthy changes in body composition, decreasing body fat and increasing lean body mass. On the other hand, obesity was related to a higher content of bone resorption and inflammatory markers, which was decreased by the weight control interventions. Caloric restriction led to marked changes in trabecular microarchitecture, with a significant decrease in total volume but no changes in bone volume (BV). In addition, the intervention diet caused an increase in trabeculae number and a decrease in trabecular spacing. The training protocol increased the pore diameter and reversed the changes in cortical porosity and density of BV induced by the high protein diet at diaphysis level. Regarding the weight-maintenance stage, diminished SMI values indicate the presence of more plate-like spongiosa in sedentary and exercise groups. In conclusion, the lifestyle interventions of caloric restriction and mixed training protocol implemented as weight loss strategies have been effective to counteract some of the deleterious effects caused by a dietary induction of obesity, specifically in trabecular bone morphometric parameters as well as bone mineral content.", "INTRODUCTION: Food insecurity has long been associated with poor physical and mental health, especially among women from underrepresented minorities. Despite efforts to reduce food insecurity, rates continue to rise and remain disproportionately high among Latinx living in the United States, a group reporting worse mental health symptoms than any other ethnic group during the COVID-19 pandemic. The need to reduce the health burden associated with food insecurity among Latinas is urgent and requires a more targeted and innovative approach. Interventions using a popular education approach have proven effective among underserved populations, especially when these are delivered by community health workers. However, food insecurity status of the participants is often unreported and it is not clear whether or not results vary between those with and without food insecurity. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this quasi-experimental study was to examine physical and mental health changes among Latinas with, and without, food insecurity following a multicomponent health intervention led by community health workers using a popular education approach. METHODS: Enrolled obese Latinas (N = 98) with and without food insecurity responded to demographic, health behaviors and mental health surveys and completed biometric measurements at baseline, immediately following the intervention and at 3 months. RESULTS: At baseline, participants with food insecurity reported more anxiety and depression than those without, but average body mass index was comparable. Depression, anxiety and body mass index were lower at 3 months post and no statistically significant differences were seen between the groups. Participants with food insecurity benefited as much from the intervention as those without.We found that, although community health workers are not licensed healthcare professionals, with proper training and support, they were able to successfully reduce the risk of chronic diseases and improve mental health symptoms among food-insecure Latinas. CONCLUSION: Given the promising results, similar interventions should be implemented on a larger scale in Latino communities among food insecure women. Long-term sustainability should also be explored.", "INTRODUCTION: Evidence regarding whether the polyaxial pedicle screws at the upper instrumented vertebrae (UIV) are superior to monoaxial pedicle screws in prevention of proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) is not clear. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the influence of different types of pedicle screws at UIV on the incidence of PJK. METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively 242 patients surgically treated with instrumented segmental posterior spinal fusion at a minimum of 4 motion segments. Polyaxial pedicle screws were used at UIV in 125 patients (polyaxial group), and monoaxial pedicle screws were used at UIV in 117 patients (monoaxial group). According to the occurrence of PJK at final follow-up, patients in both the polyaxial and monoaxial groups were then divided into 2 subgroups: PJK and no proximal junctional kyphosis (NPJK). To investigate the risk factors of PJK, 2 categorized variables were analyzed statistically: 1) patient characteristics: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis, thoracolumbar junctional angle, lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, and sacral slope. 2) Surgical variables: Changes of radiographic parameters include the SVA, thoracic kyphosis, thoracolumbar junctional, LL, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, sacral slope, pedicle-upper end plate angle, the number of instrumented levels, and the most proximal and distal levels of the instrumentation. RESULTS: PJK was developed in 26 of 117 patients (22.2%) in the monoaxial group and 30 of 125 patients (24.0%) in the polyaxial group. Until the final follow-up, there was no significant difference in the incidence of PJK (chi2 = 0.107, P = 0.734) between the monoaxial and polyaxial groups. There was no significant difference in patient characteristics and surgical variables between the 2 groups, except the proximal junctional angle change (P = 0.031). In the monoaxial group, there were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the PJK and NPJK subgroups, except BMI (P = 0.042) and BMD (P = 0.037). There were no significant differences in change of radiographic parameters, except SVA change (P = 0.036), proximal junctional angle change (P = 0.029), LL change (P = 0.025), and lower instrumented vertebrae location (P = 0.036). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that obesity, osteoporosis, lower instrumented vertebra at sacrum, and LL change >10 degrees were independently associated with PJK. In the polyaxial group, there were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the PJK and NPJK subgroups, except BMI (P = 0.032) and BMD (P = 0.040). There were no significant differences in change of radiographic parameters between the PJK and NPJK subgroups, except P-UP angle (P = 0.037) and lower instrumented vertebrae location (P = 0.017). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that obesity, osteoporosis, and lower instrumented vertebra at sacrum were independently associated with PJK. CONCLUSIONS: Polyaxial pedicle screws at UIV is not superior to monoaxial pedicle screws in prevention of PJK. Obesity, osteoporosis, and lower instrumented vertebra at sacrum are risk factors for PJK in all the patients. Excessive LL reconstruction is the unique risk factor of PJK when monoaxial pedicle screws were used at UIV."]}
{"question": "Is vancomycin MIC creep a worldwide phenomenon?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: Vancomycin is currently the primary option treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, an increasing number of MRSA isolates with high MICs, within the susceptible range (vancomycin MIC creep), are being reported worldwide. Resorting to a meta-analysis approach, this study aims to assess the evidence of vancomycin MIC creep. METHODS: We searched for studies in the PubMed database. The inclusion criteria for study eligibility included the possibility of retrieving the reported data values of vancomycin MIC and information concerning the applied MIC methodology. RESULTS: The mean values of vancomycin MICs, of all 29 234 S. aureus isolates reported in the 55 studies included in the meta-analysis, were 1.23 mg/L (95% CI 1.13-1.33) and 1.20 mg/L (95% CI 1.13-1.28) determined by Etest and broth microdilution method, respectively. No significant differences were observed between these two methodologies. We found negative correlation between pooled mean/pooled proportion and time strata. CONCLUSIONS: We have found no evidence of the MIC creep phenomenon.", "BACKGROUND: Vancomycin is the primary treatment for infections caused by methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers. METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis. RESULTS: A total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively. During the 3 year period, we observed a significant fluctuation in the rate of MRSA with a vancomycin MIC > 1 mg/L (2007: 86.2%; 2008: 93.3%; 2009: 58.8%, p = 0.002). No MRSA isolate presented a MIC > 2 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to find in our institution data compatible to the presence of vancomycin MIC creep during the study period. This phenomenon seems not to be generalized; as a result each institution should systematically monitor MRSA vancomycin MIC over time.", "Around the world, Staphylococcus aureus remains a dominant cause of bacteraemia. Whilst meticillin resistance remains the major phenotype of concern, various levels of reduced glycopeptide susceptibility are emerging with increasing frequency. The most common MRSA phenotypes now have raised vancomycin MICs within the susceptible range (MICs of 1-2mg/L). This phenomenon, known as MIC creep, is hotly contested and often denied. Key to detecting MIC creep may be to examine isolates fresh, as freezing can allow reversion to wild-type MIC, presumably by loss of mutations. Treatment failure is common with vancomycin and it is uncertain whether higher doses are beneficial. At the other extreme, when enough mutations have accumulated, full VISA status is achieved, although this can also be unstable on storage. Heteroresistant and VISA strains can be considered the inevitable end result of continued MIC creep and are even more likely to fail glycopeptide treatment. Currently full vancomycin resistance is uncommon, with only approximately 20 strains described and confirmed worldwide. Empirical treatment for patients with undefined Gram-positive sepsis can undoubtedly be improved by knowledge of MRSA status, so this is a potential advantage of hospital admission screening. If a patient is risk-assessed or screen-positive for MRSA, and infection is not serious, then vancomycin or teicoplanin is appropriate empirical therapy, providing loading doses are given to achieve therapeutic concentrations immediately (trough 15 mg/L). For life-threatening infections, the glycopeptides are inadequate unless the isolate is likely to be fully susceptible (Etest<1.5mg/L). If not, daptomycin (8-10mg/L) can be used as monotherapy but the MIC should be measured as soon as possible.", "BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an established pathogen that causes hospital- and community-acquired infections worldwide. The prevalence rate of MRSA infections were reported to be the highest in Asia. As there is limited epidemiological study being done in Malaysia, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of MRSA infection and the molecular characteristics of MRSA bacteraemia. METHODS: Two hundred and nine MRSA strains from year 2011 to 2012 were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital in Malaysia. The strains were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, detection of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Patient's demographic and clinical data were collected and correlated with molecular data by statistical analysis. RESULTS: Male gender and patient >50 years of age (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with the increased risk of MRSA acquisition. Fifty-nine percent of MRSA strains were HA-MRSA that carried SCCmec type II, III, IV and V while 31% were CA-MRSA strains with SCCmec III, IV and V. The prevalence of PVL gene among 2011 MRSA strains was 5.3% and no PVL gene was detected in 2012 MRSA strains. All of the strains were sensitive to vancomycin. However, vancomycin MIC creep phenomenon was demonstrated by the increased number of MRSA strains with MIC >/=1.5 mug/mL (p = 0.008) between 2011 and 2012. Skin disease (p = 0.034) and SCCmec type III (p = 0.0001) were found to be significantly associated with high vancomycin MIC. Forty-four percent of MRSA strains from blood, were further subtyped by MLST and PFGE. Most of the bacteraemia cases were primary bacteraemia and the common comorbidities were diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The predominant pulsotype was pulsotype C exhibited by SCCmec III-ST239. This is a first study in Malaysia that reported the occurrence of MRSA clones such as SCCmec V-ST5, untypeable-ST508, SCCmec IV-ST1 and SCCmec IV-ST1137. CONCLUSIONS: SCCmec type III remained predominant among the MRSA strains in this hospital. The occurrence of SCCmec IV and V among hospital strains and the presence of SCCmec III in CA-MRSA strains are increasing. MRSA strains causing bacteraemia over the two-year study period were found to be genetically diverse."]}

This study assessed the DKK3 protein expression in gastric cancer and its potential value as a prognostic marker. METHODS: DKK3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 158 gastric cancer samples from patients who underwent gastrectomy from 2002 to 2008. Clinicopathological parameters and survival data were analyzed. RESULTS: Loss of DKK3 expression was found in 64 of 158 (40.5%) samples, and it was associated with advanced T stage (p < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), UICC TNM stage (p < 0.001), tumor location (p = 0.029), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.035), and perineural invasion (p = 0.032). Patients without DKK3 expression in tumor cells had a significantly worse disease-free and overall survival than those with DKK3 expression (p < 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). TNM stage (p = 0.028 and p < 0.001, respectively) and residual tumor (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival. Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients. CONCLUSION: Loss of DKK3 protein expression was significantly associated with poor survival in patients with gastric cancer and was strongly correlated with the TNM stage. DKK3 might be a potential biomarker of lymph node involvement that can improve the predictive power of CT."]}
{"question": "Double reading of barium enemas: is it necessary?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to determine the effectiveness, clinical impact, and feasibility of double reading barium enemas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Independent double readings of 1,003 consecutive barium enemas (822 double- and 181 single-contrast examinations) were prospectively performed. From this pool of 1,003 examinations, 994 were included in our study. Examinations showing at least one polyp or carcinoma 5 mm or larger were considered to have positive results. For combined readings, results were considered positive if either of the two interpreters reported finding a polyp or carcinoma. A McNemar test was used to compare the first reader's results with the combined results of the first and second readers. Results were retrospectively correlated with endoscopic or surgical results in 360 patients, and agreement between first and combined readings and endoscopic results was determined. RESULTS: Adding a second reader increased the number of positive results on examinations from 249 to 315 (p < 0.0001) and resulted in potential alteration of clinical treatment in 98 patients (9.9%). Sensitivity of the first and combined readings for detection of all lesions was identical, 76.3% (95% CI, 65.4-87.1%). Specificity decreased from 91.0% (95% CI, 87.9-94.3%) for the first reading to 86.4% (95% CI, 82.2-90.0%) for the combined reading. The overall measurement of agreement decreased from a kappa value of 61.8 (95% CI, 51.2-72.4%) for the first reading to 52.9 (95% CI, 42.2-63.6%) for the combined reading. The second reading required an average of 3.3 min. Sensitivity for the detection of adenocarcinomas was 100%. CONCLUSION: Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate."]}

Pregnancies were dated by accurate last menstrual period consistent with crown-rump length (CRL) measurements at the time of screening, early pregnancy CRL or date of fertilization. The association between birth weight and the difference between the measured and the expected CRL at the time of NT screening was analyzed. RESULTS: The difference between measured and expected CRL, expressed both in mm and in days of gestation, was statistically greater in the severely macrosomic neonates compared with controls (mean, 6.66 +/- 4.78 mm vs. 1.17 +/- 4.6 mm, P < 0.0001 and 3 +/- 2.2 days vs. 0.5 +/- 2.3 days, P < 0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, there were significant correlations between the extent of macrosomia and the discrepancy between expected and measured fetal size at the time of NT screening (r = 0.47, P < 0.01 and r = 0.48, P < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Severe macrosomia apparently manifests as early as 11-14 weeks' gestation."]}
{"question": "Do older adults with cancer fall more often?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine whether a history of cancer increased the likelihood of a fall in community-dwelling older adults, and if cancer type, stage, or time since diagnosis increased falls. DESIGN: A longitudinal, retrospective, cohort study. SETTING: A home- and community-based waiver program in Michigan. SAMPLE: 862 older adults aged 65 years or older with cancer compared to 8,617 older adults without cancer using data from the Minimum Data Set-Home Care and Michigan cancer registry. METHODS: Reports of falls were examined for 90-180 days. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare differences between the groups. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Cancer, falls, patient characteristics, comorbidities, medications, pain, weight loss, vision, memory recall, and activities, as well as cancer type, stage, and time since diagnosis. FINDINGS: A fall occurred at a rate of 33% in older adults with cancer compared to 29% without cancer (p < 0.00). Those with a history of cancer were more likely to fall than those without cancer (adjusted odds ratio 1.16; 95% confidence interval [1.02, 1.33]; p = 0.03). No differences in fall rates were determined by cancer type or stage, and the odds of a fall did not increase when adding time since cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The fall rate was higher in older adults with cancer than in older adults without cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses need to assess fall risk and initiate fall prevention measures for older adults at the time of cancer diagnosis. KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION: When caring for older adults with cancer, nurses should be aware of an increased risk for falls. Healthcare staff also should be aware of an increased risk for falls in that population during cancer treatment. Evidence-based fall prevention measures should be included in care plans for older adult cancer survivors.", "Falls among older people are common and are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Increasingly cancer is becoming a disease of older people and fall rates are higher in elders living with cancer. Cancer and its treatments potentiate important risk factors for falls, including muscle weakness, poor balance, proprioception, cognitive impairment and functional disability. Sarcopenia refers to the progressive deterioration in muscle strength, mass and quality with ageing. Chronic conditions and cancer amplify this decline and are associated with a greater negative effect on function. Age-related impairments of lower limb neurological function are commonly exacerbated by neurotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in gait and balance deficits. Postural instability and falls erode confidence and result in a negative cycle of diminishing activity levels, further deconditioning and a higher risk of further falls. Cancer-related fatigue, sleep and mood disturbances compound this progressive frailty, further worsening treatment tolerance and outcomes. Cognitive impairment is a potent risk factor for falling and is frequently associated with gait abnormalities. The well-recognised effects of cancer treatment on working memory, attention, processing speed and executive function are often apparent (when their presence is sought) before treatment and may be as much the result of the cancer itself as they are 'chemo brain'. Structured exercise programmes focusing on progressively challenging strength and balance training are of proven benefit in falls prevention. Regular aerobic exercise accrues additional benefits in improved cardiorespiratory resilience and concomitant positive effects on treatment tolerance. Increased activity levels positively influence cognition, mood and foster an improved sense of well-being. Simple, practicable clinic-based tests of physical functioning, cognition and neurological function can help to identify those at high risk of falls and functional decline. The use of such instruments can aid judicious treatment planning and identify those most likely to benefit from more detailed specialist comprehensive geriatric assessment.", "OBJECTIVES: Falls are increasingly worrisome to older adults with cancer due to the side effects of cancer and its treatments. Understanding the circumstances of falls is important in the development of fall prevention strategies. The aim of this study is to understand the circumstances of falls in older patients with cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study in which adults aged >/=65 years with cancer receiving systemic cancer therapy were followed for fall outcomes for six months. Falls were assessed by monthly fall calendars; 51 participants who reported a fall were interviewed regarding the fall. RESULTS: The cohort had an average age of 72.2 +/- 5.2 years; 37% were female and 90% were white. Half (25/51) had experienced falls in the six months prior to enrollment. During the follow-up period, 78 falls occurred in 51 individuals over 6 months: 36 patients had 1 fall, 9 patients had 2 falls, 3 had 3 falls, and 1 each had 4, 5, or 6 falls. Nearly half of falls (51%) took place in the home and 38 (49%) occurred outside of the home. CONCLUSIONS: Falls occurred at similar rates both inside the home and outside the home, indicating that familiarity with the person's surroundings does not protect against falls. Symptoms of cancer treatments were not mentioned during fall assessment, which may indicate a need for more awareness of the side effects of cancer medications and future developments of fall prevention methods.", "OBJECTIVES: Older adults frequently experience falls, at great cost to themselves and society. Older adults with cancer may be at greater risk for falls and have unique risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of the available medical literature to examine the current evidence regarding factors associated with falls in older adults with cancer. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, DARE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and clinical trials.gov were searched using standardized terms for concepts of oncology/cancer, people 60 and older, screening, falls and diagnosis. Eligible studies included cohort or case-control studies or clinical trials in which all patients, or a subgroup of patients, had a diagnosis of cancer and in which falls were either the primary or secondary outcome. RESULTS: We identified 31 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Several studies suggest that falls are more common in older adults with a diagnosis of cancer than those without. Among the 11 studies that explored factors associated with outpatient falls, some risk factors for falls established in the general population were also associated with falls in older adults with cancer, including dependence in activities of daily living and prior falls. Other factors associated with falls in a general population, such as age, polypharmacy and opioid use, were not predictive of falls among oncology populations. Falls among older adults with cancer in the inpatient setting were associated with established risk factors for falls in people without cancer, but also with factors unique to an oncology population, such as brain metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Falls in older adults with cancer are more common than in the general population, and are associated with risk factors unique to people with cancer. Further study is needed to establish methods of screening older adults with cancer for fall risk and ultimately implement interventions to reduce their risk of falls. Identifying which older adults with cancer are at greater risk for falls is a requisite step to ultimately intervene and prevent falls in this vulnerable population.", "PURPOSE: Little is known about the incidence of falls in cancer patients receiving cancer treatment. The aims were to explore the number of falls older adults report in the 6 months after cancer diagnosis, and if those with a fall were more frail than those who did not fall. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of a prospective pilot study that recruited patients aged 65 and older with a new cancer diagnosis. At each interview (baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up), participants were asked if they had a fall in the previous 3 months. The frailty markers and functional status were obtained at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up. Chi-square and t tests were used to compare those who had a fall to those who had no fall. Univariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the association between sociodemographic and health characteristics and reporting a fall. RESULTS: Seventeen participants (18.7%) reported one or more falls in the first 6 months after cancer diagnosis. Fifteen participants reported one or more falls in the 3 months prior to the cancer diagnosis. Those who had a fall and those with no fall were not different in terms of health and functioning. None of the sociodemographic and health characteristics including the frailty markers were associated with a fall. CONCLUSION: A fall is common in cancer patients. More research is needed to examine the risk factors for a fall in older adults receiving cancer treatment."]}
{"question": "Is grandmultiparity an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes?", "retrieved_passages": ["The objective of this study was to compare incidence of antenatal and intrapartum complications among women who had previously delivered five or more times (grandmultiparas cases, 155) with that of age-matched women with two to three previous deliveries (multiparas controls, 155) from 1998 to 2003. Grandmultiparity was associated with a low socioeconomic status, higher incidence of smoking, and a higher body mass index. Grandmultiparas had approximately 2-fold increased risk of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, malpresentation, and preterm delivery, and a 3-fold increased risk of abruption; none reached statistical significance. No significant differences were found in antepartum hemorrhage, anemia, postdatism, polyhydramnios, or placenta previa. Intrapartum complications (labor induction, nonreassuring fetal heart, primary cesarean delivery, and intrapartum fever) were similar; however, operative vaginal delivery was significantly lower in grandmultiparas cases. Both groups were similar regarding birthweight, macrosomia, intrauterine growth restriction, Apgar scores, and stillbirth rates. Our study shows a trend toward an increased risk of adverse obstetrical outcome in grandmultiparas compared with multiparas independent of maternal age.", "OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and neonatal outcomes among grandmultiparous women to those of multiparous women 30 years or older. METHODS: A database of the vast majority of maternal and newborn hospital discharge records linked to birth/death certificates was queried to obtain information on all multiparous women with a singleton delivery in the state of California from January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1998. Maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes of grandmultiparous women were compared to multiparous women who were 30 years or older at the time of their last birth. RESULTS: The study population included 25,512 grandmultiparous and 265,060 multiparous women 30 years or older as controls. Grandmultiparous women were predominantly Hispanic (56%). After controlling for potential confounding factors, grandmultiparous women were at significantly higher risk for abruptio placentae (odds ratio OR: 1.3; 95% confidence intervals CI: 1.2-1.5), preterm delivery (OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.2-1.4), fetal macrosomia (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.4-1.6), neonatal death (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.8), postpartum hemorrhage (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.3) and blood transfusion (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.8). CONCLUSION: Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "OBJECTIVE: To examine the perinatal outcome in women of extreme grandmultiparity (EGMP) in a setting with good socio-economic conditions and modern perinatal care. METHODS: About 1015 pregnant women with a parity of 10 and above who delivered at Al-Mafraq hospital, Abu Dhabi between 1992 and 1998 were compared with 2044 women of parity <5 and 1662 with parity of 5-9. RESULTS: Pregnant women with parity of 10 and above had an increased incidence of gestational diabetes (P<0.001) and macrosomia (P<0.001) and a reduced incidence of preterm delivery (P<0.0001) and induction of labor (P<0.0001). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding, antepartum hemorrhage, cesarean section rate and neonatal outcomes.

We assessed the value of antenatal risk allocation made at the first visit in identifying women who will experience pregnancy complications in a rural area in Zimbabwe. As part of an ANC trial women were allocated into low- and high-risk categories based on medical, demographic and obstetric history. All highrisk women were recommended hospital delivery. This evaluation is based on 5223 women who received traditional care from nurse-midwives in 12 rural health centres, of whom 2890 (55%) were classified as high risk by the traditional risk markers, including 1618 nulliparous women. Complications occurred in 924 (17.7%) women 577 (62.4%) of whom had risk markers identified at booking. Twenty per cent (577/2890) of women classified as high risk developed complications. There was a high recurrence of complications, such as hypertensive disorders, operative delivery and preterm delivery. Nulliparity was a risk for low birth weight, operative delivery and hypertensive disorders, whereas grandmultiparity (> or =6) was a risk for hypertension in pregnancy. Young age (< or =16 years) was)a risk factor for low birth weight and perinatal death. Age above 35 years was not an independent risk factor. The traditional risk allocation system, with a likelihood ratio of 1.16, was not effective in identifying women at risk of pregnancy complications and resulted in too large a risk group for referral.", "BACKGROUND: In developing countries, home delivery increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality. Despite this, home deliveries account for a considerable share of deliveries in developing nations such as Ethiopia. Evidence on factors that affect homebirth is required for the measures needed to overcome these conditions. OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of homebirth among women attending health facilities in Wondo Genet, Sidama Region. METHODS: Unmatched case-control study was conducted from May to June 2021 among 308 mothers (102 cases and 206 controls) who recently delivered and visited either postnatal care or sought immunization service at public health facilities of Wondo Genet. A structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Epi-Data version 3.1 was used for data entry, and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 was used for data analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the determinants of homebirth. The association between the outcome variable and independent variables was declared statistically significant at a P-value < 0.05 with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) in a multivariable model. RESULTS: Rural residence [AOR: 3.41; 95%CI: 1.58-7.39], lifetime physical IPV [AOR: 2.35; 95%CI: 1.06-5.17], grand-multiparity [AOR: 5.36; 95%CI: 1.68-17.08], non-use of contraception before recent pregnancy [AOR: 5.82; 95%CI: 2.49-13.60], >30 min to reach health facility [AOR: 2.14; 95%CI: 1.02-4.51], and lack of facemask [AOR: 2.69; 95%CI: 1.25-5.77] were statistically significant predictors of homebirth. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The access gap to maternity services should be narrowed between rural and urban women. Healthcare programs concerning women's empowerment could help reduce persistent intimate partner violence. Family planning needs to be promoted, and multiparous women should be counseled on the adverse obstetric consequences of homebirth. The devastating effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on maternity services should be prevented."]}
{"question": "Is crime associated with over-the-counter pharmacy syringe sales?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: More than 50,000 new HIV infections occur annually in the United States. Injection drug users represent twelve percent of incident HIV infections each year. Pharmacy sales of over-the-counter (OTC) syringes have helped prevent HIV transmission among injection drug users in many states throughout the United States. However, concerns exist among some law enforcement officials, policymakers, pharmacists, and community members about potential links between OTC syringe sales and crime. METHODS: We used a geographic information system and novel spatial and longitudinal analyses to determine whether implementation of pharmacy-based OTC syringe sales were associated with reported crime between January 2006 and December 2008 in Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts. We assessed reported crime pre- and post-OTC syringe sales initiation as well as longitudinal associations between crime and OTC syringe-selling pharmacies. RESULTS: By December 2008, 9.3% (94/1010) of Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts had at least one OTC syringe-selling pharmacy. Overall reported crime counts and reported crime rates decreased between 2006 and 2008 in all 1010 Reporting Districts. Using generalized estimating equations and adjusting for potential confounders, reported crime rates were negatively associated with OTC syringe sales (adjusted rate ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.81, 0.99). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that OTC pharmacy syringe sales were not associated with increases in reported crime in local communities in Los Angeles during 2006-2008."]}
{"question": "Does strategy training reduce age-related deficits in working memory?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Older adults typically perform worse on measures of working memory (WM) than do young adults; however, age-related differences in WM performance might be reduced if older adults use effective encoding strategies. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current experiment was to evaluate WM performance after training individuals to use effective encoding strategies. METHODS: Participants in the training group (older adults: n = 39; young adults: n = 41) were taught about various verbal encoding strategies and their differential effectiveness and were trained to use interactive imagery and sentence generation on a list-learning task. Participants in the control group (older: n = 37; young: n = 38) completed an equally engaging filler task. All participants completed a pre- and post-training reading span task, which included self-reported strategy use, as well as two transfer tasks that differed in the affordance to use the trained strategies - a paired-associate recall task and the self-ordered pointing task. RESULTS: Both young and older adults were able to use the target strategies on the WM task and showed gains in WM performance after training. The age-related WM deficit was not greatly affected, however, and the training gains did not transfer to the other cognitive tasks. In fact, participants attempted to adapt the trained strategies for a paired-associate recall task, but the increased strategy use did not benefit their performance. CONCLUSIONS: Strategy training can boost WM performance, and its benefits appear to arise from strategy-specific effects and not from domain-general gains in cognitive ability.", "Spatial cognition is known to decline with aging. However, little is known about whether training can reduce or eliminate age-related deficits in spatial memory. We investigated whether a custom-designed video game involving spatial navigation, obstacle avoidance, and balance control would improve spatial memory in older adults. Specifically, 56 healthy adults aged 65 to 84 years received 10 sessions of multicomponent video game training, based on a virtual cityscape, over 5 weeks. Participants were allocated to one of three training conditions: the main intervention, the \"CityQuest\" group (n = 19), and two control groups, spatial navigation without obstacle avoidance (\"Spatial Navigation-only\" group, n = 21) and obstacle avoidance without spatial navigation (\"Obstacles-only\" group, n = 15). Performance on object recognition, egocentric and allocentric spatial memory (incorporating direction judgment tasks and landmark location tasks, respectively), navigation strategy preference, and executive functioning was assessed in pre- and post-intervention sessions. The results showed an overall benefit on performance in a number of spatial memory measures and executive function for participants who received spatial navigation training, particularly the CityQuest group, who also showed significant improvement on the landmark location task. However, there was no evidence of a shift from egocentric to allocentric strategy preference. We conclude that spatial memory in healthy older participants is amenable to improvement with training over a short term. Moreover, technology based on age-appropriate, multicomponent video games may play a key role in cognitive training in older adults.", "Although dopamine D(3) receptor antagonists have been shown to enhance frontocortical cholinergic transmission and improve cognitive performance in rodents, data are limited and their effects have never been examined in primates. Accordingly, we characterized the actions of the D(3) receptor antagonist, S33138, in rats and rhesus monkeys using a suite of procedures in which cognitive performance was disrupted by several contrasting manipulations. S33138 dose-dependently (0.01-0.63 mg/kg s.c.) blocked a delay-induced impairment of novel object recognition in rats, a model of visual learning and memory. Further, S33138 (0.16-2.5 mg/kg s.c.) similarly reduced a delay-induced deficit in social novelty discrimination in rats, a procedure principally based on olfactory cues. Adult rhesus monkeys were trained to perform cognitive procedures, then chronically exposed to low doses of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine which produced cognitive impairment without motor disruption. In an attentional set-shifting task of cognitive flexibility involving an extra-dimensional shift, deficits were reversed by S33138 (0.04 and 0.16 mg/kg p.o.). S33138 also significantly improved accuracy (0.04 and 0.16 mg/kg p.o.) at short (but not long) delays in a variable delayed-response task of attention and working memory. Finally, in a separate set of experiments performed in monkeys displaying age-related deficits, S33138 significantly (0.16 and 0.63 mg/kg p.o.) improved task accuracies for long delay intervals in a delayed matching-to-sample task of working memory. In conclusion, S33138 improved performance in several rat and primate procedures of cognitive impairment. These data underpin interest in D(3) receptor blockade as a strategy for improving cognitive performance in CNS disorders like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease."]}
{"question": "Does the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension identify cognitive impairments?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relevance of the Symptom Checklist 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale to cognition in individuals with brain tumor. DESIGN: A prospective study of patients assessed with a neuropsychological test battery. SETTING: A university medical center. PATIENTS: Nineteen adults with biopsy-confirmed diagnoses of malignant brain tumors were assessed prior to aggressive chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Included in the assessment were the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, California Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test B, Symptom Checklist 90-R, Mood Assessment Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Chronic Illness Problem Inventory. RESULTS: The SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale was not related to objective measures of attention, verbal memory, or age. It was related significantly to symptoms of depression (r = .81, P < .005), anxiety (r = .66, P < .005), and subjective complaints of memory problems (r = .75, P < .005). Multivariate analyses indicated that reported symptoms of depression contributed 66% of the variance in predicting SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive Scores, whereas symptoms of anxiety contributed an additional 6% (P < .0001).

{"question": "Is muscle power related to running speed with changes of direction?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify the relationships between leg muscle power and sprinting speed with changes of direction. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: the study was designed to describe relationships between physical qualities and a component of sports performance. SETTING: testing was conducted in an indoor sports hall and a biomechanics laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: 15 male participants were required to be free of injury and have recent experience competing in sports involving sprints with changes of direction. MEASURES: subjects were timed in 8 m sprints in a straight line and with various changes of direction. They were also tested for bilateral and unilateral leg extensor muscle concentric power output by an isokinetic squat and reactive strength by a drop jump. RESULTS: The correlations between concentric power and straight sprinting speed were non-significant whereas the relationships between reactive strength and straight speed were statistically significant. Correlations between muscle power and speed while changing direction were generally low and non-significant for concentric leg power with some moderate and significant (p<0.05) coefficients found for reactive strength. The participants who turned faster to one side tended to have a reactive strength dominance in the leg responsible for the push-off action. CONCLUSIONS: The relationships between leg muscle power and change-of-direction speed were not consistent. Reactive strength as measured by the drop jump appears to have some importance for lateral change-of-direction speed, possibly because of similar push-off actions. It was concluded that reactive strength of the leg extensor muscles has some importance in change-of-direction performance but the other technical and perceptual factors than influence agility performance should also be considered.", "Change of direction speed (CODS) is determined by several physical aspects, such as linear sprint speed, reactive strength and power of leg muscles. It appears that core strength may also play a role in CODS, however, its relationship to CODS remains unclear. The aim of this narrative review was to analyze the literature addressing a) the relationship between core strength and CODS and b) the effect of core strength training on CODS. This analysis revealed a significant relationship between the parameters of core strength and stability (the pressure of the activated core muscles during lower limb movement and the greatest mean force output of maximum volunteered contraction) and the time in the Agility T-Test. However, this parameter was not significantly related to the strength endurance of core muscles (total time in the plank test). Core training provides a sufficient stimulus for the development of CODS in less-skilled middle-adolescent athletes, while its effectiveness decreases in higher-skilled adult athletes. These findings indicate that core muscle strength contributes significantly to the change of direction speed. Core training is therefore useful for improving CODS.", "PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to 1) compare the metabolic power demand of straight-line and change of direction (COD) sprints including 45 degrees  or 90 degrees -turns, and 2) examine the relation between estimated metabolic demands and muscular activity throughout the 3 phases of COD-sprints. METHODS: Twelve highly-trained soccer players performed one 25-m and three 20-m sprints, either in straight-line or with one 45 degrees - or 90 degrees -COD. Sprints were monitored with 2 synchronized 100-Hz laser guns to assess players' velocities before, during and after the COD. Acceleration and deceleration were derived from changes in speed over time. Metabolic power was estimated based on di Prampero's approach (2005). Electromyography amplitude (RMS) of 2 lower limb muscles was measured. The expected energy expenditure during time-adjusted straight-line sprints (matching COD sprints time) was also calculated. RESULTS: Locomotor-dependant metabolic demand was largely lower with COD (90 degrees , 142.1+/-13.5 J.kg(-1)) compared with time-adjusted (effect size, ES = -3.0; 193.2+/-18.6 J.kg(-1)) and non-adjusted straight-line sprints (ES = -1.7; 168.4+/-15.3 J.kg(-1)). Metabolic power requirement was angle-dependent, moderately lower for 90 degrees -COD vs. 45 degrees -COD sprint (ES = -1.0; 149.5+/-10.4 J.kg(-1)). Conversely, the RMS was slightly- (45 degrees , ES = +0.5; +2.1%, 90% confidence limits (+/-3.6) for vastus lateralis muscle (VL)) to-largely (90 degrees , ES = +1.6; +6.1 (3.3%) for VL) greater for COD-sprints. Metabolic power/RMS ratio was 2 to 4 times lower during deceleration than acceleration phases. CONCLUSION: Present results show that COD-sprints are largely less metabolically demanding than linear sprints. This may be related to the very low metabolic demand associated with the deceleration phase during COD-sprints that may not be compensated by the increased requirement of the reacceleration phase. These results also highlight the dissociation between metabolic and muscle activity demands during COD-sprints, which questions the use of metabolic power as a single measure of running load in soccer.", "PURPOSE: To describe cross-sectional age differences in change-of-direction performance (CODp) in female football players and investigate the relationship between CODp and linear-sprint speed, muscle power, and body size. METHODS: A sample of 135 well-trained female football players was divided into 8 age groups. Anthropometry (height, body mass, and lean body mass) and athletic performance (10-m sprint speed, 10-mx5-CODp, and 5-step bounding distance) were compared to determine interage differences using ANOVA. Then, the participants were divided into 3 age groups: 12- to 14-y-olds, 15- to 17-y-olds, and >/=18 y-olds. Simple- and multiple-regression analyses were conducted to determine the correlation between CODp and the other measurement variables in each age group. RESULTS: Age-related differences were found for CODp (F=10.41, P<.01), sprint speed (F=3.27, P<.01), and bounding distance (F=4.20, P<.01). Post hoc analysis revealed that the CODp of 17-y-old players was faster than that of 16-y-old players (P<.01), with no interage differences in sprint speed and bounding distance. Sprint speed and bounding distance were weakly correlated with CODp in 15- to >/=18-y-old players, but only sprint speed was correlated with CODp in 12- to 14-y-old players. CONCLUSIONS: CODp improves from 16 to 17 y of age in female players. Linear-sprint speed, muscle power, and body size were weakly correlated with the age differences in CODp.", "PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of an extreme uphill marathon on the mechanical parameters that are likely to affect the energy cost of running (Cr). METHODS: Eleven runners (27-59 y) participated in the Etna SuperMarathon (43 km, 0-3063 m above sea level). Anthropometric characteristics, maximal explosive power of the lower limb (Pmax), and maximal oxygen uptake were determined before the competition. In addition, before and immediately after the race, Cr, contact (tc) and aerial (ta) times, step frequency (f), and running velocity were measured at constant self-selected speed. Then, peak vertical ground-reaction force (Fmax), vertical downward displacement of the center of mass (Deltaz), leg-length change (DeltaL), and vertical (kvert) and leg (kleg) stiffness were calculated. RESULTS: A direct relationship between Cr, measured before the race, and race time was shown (r=.61, P<.001). Cr increased significantly at the end of the race by 8.7%. Immediately after the race, the subjects showed significantly lower ta (-58.6%), f (-11.3%), Fmax (-17.6%), kvert (-45.6%), and kleg (-42.3%) and higher tc (+28.6%), Deltaz (+52.9%), and DeltaL (+44.5%) than before the race. The increase of Cr was associated with a decrement in Fmax (r=-.45), kvert (r=-.44), and kleg (r=-.51). Finally, an inverse relationship between Pmax measured before the race and DeltaCr during race was found (r=-.52). CONCLUSIONS: Lower Cr was related with better performance, and athletes characterized by the greater Pmax showed lower increases in Cr during the race. This suggests that specific power training of the lower limbs may lead to better performance in ultraendurance running competition."]}

The MR images were evaluated for disc degeneration, disc contour abnormalities, HIZ, and endplate abnormalities. Based on the combination of an HIZ and disc contour abnormalities, four classes were determined: (1) normal or bulging disc without HIZ; (2) normal or bulging disc with HIZ; (3) disc protrusion without HIZ; (4) disc protrusion with HIZ. These MR image findings and a new combined MR classification were analyzed in the base of concordant pain determined by discography. RESULTS: Disc protrusion with HIZ [sensitivity 45.5%; specificity 97.8%; positive predictive value (PPV), 87.0%] correlated significantly with concordant pain provocation (P < 0.01). A normal or bulging disc with HIZ was not associated with reproduction of pain. Disc degeneration (sensitivity 95.4%; specificity 38.8%; PPV 33.9%), disc protrusion (sensitivity 68.2%; specificity 80.6%; PPV 53.6%), and HIZ (sensitivity 56.8%; specificity 83.6%; PPV 53.2%) were not helpful in the identification of a disc with concordant pain. CONCLUSION: The proposed MR classification is useful to predict a disc with concordant pain. Disc protrusion with HIZ on MR imaging predicted positive discography in patients with discogenic low back pain."]}
{"question": "Is a 9-month treatment sufficient in tuberculous enterocolitis?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis has increased in parallel with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic and the use of immunosuppressive therapy, and the growing incidence of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, especially with intestinal involvement, reflects this trend. However, the duration of anti-tuberculous therapy has not been clarified in intestinal tuberculosis. AIM: To compare the efficacy of different treatment durations in tuberculous enterocolitis in terms of response and recurrence rates. METHODS: Forty patients with tuberculous enterocolitis were randomized prospectively: 22 patients into a 9-month and 18 into a 15-month group. Diagnosis was made either by colonoscopic findings of discrete ulcers and histopathological findings of caseating granuloma and/or acid-fast bacilli, or by clinical improvement after therapeutic trial. Patients were followed up with colonoscopy every other month until complete response or treatment completion, and then every 6 months for 1 year and annually. Complete response was defined as a resolution of symptoms and active tuberculosis by colonoscopy. RESULTS: Complete response was obtained in all patients in both groups. Two patients in the 9-month group and one in the 15-month group underwent operation due to intestinal obstruction and perianal fistula, respectively. No recurrence of active intestinal tuberculosis occurred during the follow-up period in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculous enterocolitis can be managed by 9-month chemotherapy without disease recurrence. Further investigations are needed in immunocompromised patients."]}
{"question": "Is bicompartmental knee arthroplasty more favourable to knee muscle strength and physical performance compared to total knee arthroplasty?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Bicompartmental knee arthroplasty features bone and ligament sparing as unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and is presumably better in the recovery of muscle strength and function compared to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) though not previously reported in the literature. The aim of the study was to compare isokinetic knee muscle strength and physical performance in patients who underwent either bicompartmental knee arthroplasty or TKA. METHODS: Each of 24 patients (31 knees) was prospectively examined preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months after each surgery. Isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength as well as position sense were measured using the Biodex system. Timed up and go test, stair climbing test, and the 6-min walk test were used to assess physical performance. The results of each group were also compared with those from the corresponding healthy control, respectively. RESULTS: Demography showed significant difference in the mean age between bicompartment (54.8 +/- 5.6 years) and TKA groups (65.7 +/- 6.7 years). Comparing between the two groups, knee extensor and flexor torque, hamstring/Quadriceps ratio, position sense, and physical performance were not significantly different preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months after surgery. In intra-group analysis, muscle strength and position sense at each time point were not different in both groups. In physical performance, both groups resulted in improvement in the 6-min walk test, and only TKA group showed enhancement in stair climbing test. CONCLUSIONS: Although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty."]}
{"question": "Can gingival crevicular blood be relied upon for assessment of blood glucose level?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: The current study's aim was to assess gingival crevicular blood as a noninvasive method to measure blood glucose levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study comprised a total of 50 patients who had been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis and age was >/=30 years old. The study's procedures were carried out after receiving informed consent. For finger capillary blood collection method, a sterile lancet was used to prick the finger and a drop of blood was taken, for gingival crevicular blood collection method, blood was taken from the gingival margin of the chosen site, and for venous blood collection method with the aid of a disposable syringe, a venous blood sample was taken from the patient's antecubital fossa for determining blood glucose levels. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the differences between the three methodologies' significance, and Karl Pearson's correlation (r) was used to determine their correlation. RESULTS: The maximum glucose level was found in venous blood (187.78 +/- 18.23), followed by finger capillary blood (181.88 +/- 21.67) and gingival crevicular blood (169.04 +/- 11.24). And there was no significant difference between the different blood collection methods (p > 0.05). The positive significant correlation was found between gingival crevicular blood and finger capillary blood (r = 0.912, p < 0.001). Correlation with gingival crevicular blood and venous blood showed a positive correlation (r = 0.898, p < 0.001). Correlation between venous blood and finger capillary blood also showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.988, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the findings of the current study suggest that blood drawn from the gingival crevicular during a clinical examination may be a great source for glucometric analysis. The gingival crevicular blood may show to be a promising technique for routine dental office screening for diabetes mellitus in periodontal patients, even if capillary/venous blood samples used for diabetes mellitus screening are the gold standard. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Oral health is crucial for the early detection of many systemic disorders. As a result, dentists are crucial in the screening for systemic disorders. One of the prevalent chronic disorders is diabetes. Any systemic disease that is detected early enough can avoid long-term problems.", "This study was conducted to assess the usefulness of the gingival crevicular blood for estimating the glucose level during routine periodontal examination using Xitux Diagnostics Smart-X self-monitoring blood glucose device among Jordanian patients attending dental teaching clinics. A total of 34 type 2 diabetic patients (18 males and 16 females) and 26 non-diabetic patients (14 males and 12 females) participated in this study. Glucose level was measured in a sample of gingival crevicular blood and in another sample obtained by finger puncture using a self-monitoring device. Glucose measurements from gingival crevicular blood samples, ranged from 57 to 250 mg dl-1 with a mean of 125.4+/-60.7 mg dl-1 (+/-SD) and glucose measurements obtained by finger puncture, ranged from 62 to 263 mg dl-1 with a mean of 131.9+/-61.1 mg dl-1. Pearson's correlation coefficient was performed to assess the correlation between the glucose measurements in these two samples. Pearson's correlation coefficient showed an almost perfect positive correlation between the gingival readings and finger-puncture readings (r=0.997, P<0.0001). In conclusion, gingival crevicular blood can provide an acceptable source for measuring blood glucose level. However, the technique to obtain an acceptable blood sample from gingival crevices is not always feasible which would limit its application as a clinical practice. Additional studies that refine this technique and use larger sample size are recommended.", "OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of using gingival crevice blood (GCB) collected during routine periodontal examination to estimate blood glucose levels using a novel and very sensitive self-monitoring device (FreeStyle). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients (20 male, 26 female; age range 12-56 years, mean age 36 +/- 11 years) seeking dental treatment took part in the study. Three and 4 patients reported diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, respectively; 24 had gingivitis, of which 22 were moderate or advanced periodontitis. Periodontal probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss was measured at 6 sites of every tooth present, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded. A site with profuse BOP was chosen for glucose determination. Measurements in GCB were compared with those of conventional capillary fingerstick blood (CFB). RESULTS: Sufficiently large GCB volumes provided glucometer readings in 32 cases (range 1.17-10.00 mmol/l). The CFB readings ranged between 1.39 and 11.50 mmol/l. If low amounts of crevice blood prohibited a glucometer reading, significantly lower mean numbers of sites with BOP (26 vs. 67, p <0.001) and elevated PD > or =4 mm (2 vs. 21, p <0.05) were seen. Agreement between the two measurements was low, the mean difference was -1.22, and limits of agreement (1.96 times the standard deviation of differences) were +/-2.89 mmol/l. CONCLUSION: The present study failed to provide any evidence for the usefulness of GCB for testing blood glucose during routine periodontal examination.", "AIM: This study was designed to assess the reliability of blood glucose level estimation in gingival crevicular blood(GCB) for screening diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHOD: 70 patients were included in study. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was performed. Among these, 39 patients were diabetic (including 4 patients who were diagnosed during the study) and rest 31 patients were non-diabetic. GCB obtained during routine periodontal examination was analyzed by glucometer to know blood glucose level. The same patient underwent for finger stick blood (FSB) glucose level estimation with glucometer and venous blood (VB) glucose level with standardized laboratory method as per American Diabetes Association Guidelines.(1) All the three blood glucose levels were compared. Periodontal parameters were also recorded including gingival index (GI) and probing pocket depth (PPD). RESULTS: A strong positive correlation (r) was observed between glucose levels of GCB with FSB and VB with the values of 0.986 and 0.972 in diabetic group and 0.820 and 0.721 in non-diabetic group. As well, the mean values of GI and PPD were more in diabetic group than non-diabetic group with the statistically significant difference (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: GCB can be reliably used to measure the blood glucose level as the values were closest to glucose levels estimated by VB. The technique is safe, easy to perform and non-invasive to the patient and can increase the frequency of diagnosing diabetes during routine periodontal therapy.", "AIM: The present study was aimed to assess the fasting and postprandial gingival crevicular blood (GCB) glucose and finger stick blood glucose measurements using a glucometer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 subjects with periodontitis and positive bleeding on probing were considered. Subjects were instructed to report to the department after overnight fasting. Gingival crevicular blood samples were collected from anterior region showing bleeding on probing followed by finger stick blood sample collection. Then, the patients were instructed to take 75 gm of glucose and after 2 hours blood samples from two sites were collected similarly. Results were analyzed using unpaired t test and Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: Mean glucose levels form GCB and finger stick blood did not differ either during fasting or postprandial (p > 0.05). Significant correlation was found between GCB glucose levels and capillary finger stick blood (CFB) glucose levels during fasting (r = 0.946, p < 0.001) and postprandial (r=0.930, p < 0.001) blood estimation. CONCLUSION: Periodontal probing can be considered as an alternate noninvasive method of blood glucose estimation for screening of diabetes mellitus (DM). The technique described is safe, easy to perform, and helps to increase the frequency of diabetes screening in dental office. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The GCB from probing can be a good source of blood for estimating blood glucose levels and screening for diabetes using portable glucose monitors. Also, it will be a simple and relatively inexpensive in office screening procedure for any patient suspected to have diabetes."]}
{"question": "Predicting admission at triage: are nurses better than a simple objective score?", "retrieved_passages": ["AIM: We compared two methods of predicting hospital admission from ED triage: probabilities estimated by triage nurses and probabilities calculated by the Glasgow Admission Prediction Score (GAPS). METHODS: In this single-centre prospective study, triage nurses estimated the probability of admission using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), and GAPS was generated automatically from triage data. We compared calibration using rank sum tests, discrimination using area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and accuracy with McNemar's test. RESULTS: Of 1829 attendances, 745 (40.7%) were admitted, not significantly different from GAPS' prediction of 750 (41.0%, p=0.678). In contrast, the nurses' mean VAS predicted 865 admissions (47.3%), overestimating by 6.6% (p<0.0001). GAPS discriminated between admission and discharge as well as nurses, its AUC 0.876 compared with 0.875 for VAS (p=0.93). As a binary predictor, its accuracy was 80.6%, again comparable with VAS (79.0%), p=0.18. In the minority of attendances, when nurses felt at least 95% certain of the outcome, VAS' accuracy was excellent, at 92.4%. However, in the remaining majority, GAPS significantly outperformed VAS on calibration (+1.2% vs +9.2%, p<0.0001), discrimination (AUC 0.810 vs 0.759, p=0.001) and accuracy (75.1% vs 68.9%, p=0.0009). When we used GAPS, but 'over-ruled' it when clinical certainty was >/=95%, this significantly outperformed either method, with AUC 0.891 (0.877-0.907) and accuracy 82.5% (80.7%-84.2%). CONCLUSIONS: GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected."]}
{"question": "Diagnosis and follow-up in constipated children: should we use ultrasound?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: We investigated the efficacy of ultrasound in determining megarectum and fecal load and the response to treatment in constipation and tried to specify objective criteria in this study. METHODS: A total of 66 cases were queried and divided into 2 groups as constipated (n = 35; mean age, 6.8 +/- 2.9 years) and control (n = 31; mean age, 8.4 +/- 3.8 years) according to Rome III criteria. After the clinical evaluation, pelvic ultrasonography (US) was performed by 2 separate radiologists. The bladder capacity and the transverse rectal diameter were measured with a full bladder. Then the rectal diameter and rectal anterior wall thickness were measured, and the presence of fecal load in the rectum and sigmoid colon was recorded with an empty bladder. The examination and ultrasound were repeated after treatment for a month in these patients. RESULTS: Comparison of the US measurements of the 2 radiologists performing the US tests did not show any interobserver difference (r = 0.981; P < .001). We therefore believe our results are objective and reproducible. We found a positive correlation between the rectal diameters and the age, height, weight, and bladder capacity. The posturination mean rectal diameter was thicker in the constipated group (3.02 +/- 1.04 cm) than in the control group (1.98 +/- 0.64 cm) (P < .001). The cutoff point of rectal diameter for a diagnosis of constipation was determined as 2.44 cm (71% sensitive; 76% specific; area under curve, 0.825; P < .001). The rectal anterior wall thickness and fecal load were higher in the constipated patients (P < .001). There was a significant decrease in the constipation score and fecal load after treatment for a month (P < .001), but the rectal diameter had not reached normal limits yet despite the decrease (2.71 +/- 0.77 cm) (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.", "INTRODUCTION: Kidney ureter bladder radiography (KUB) is widely used for the evaluation of constipation in children with bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD); however, there is varying evidence to support its routine diagnostic use. One drawback to KUB is radiation exposure. The dangers of radiation in children are well-documented, and per As Low As Reasonably Achievable, non-beneficial radiation should be avoided. This risk is especially high in children who undergo repeated imaging in the follow up of constipation treatment. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the utility of KUB in diagnosing children with BBD by comparing it to four diagnostic tests and/or validated instruments: the Dysfunctional Voiding Symptom Score (DVSS), Rome IV criteria, rectal diameter on ultrasound (RD), and the Bristol Stool Form Score (BSFS). STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively enrolled a cohort of patients presenting to an academic pediatric urology practice with symptoms of BBD. Severity of stool burden on KUB (mild, moderate, or severe), RD on ultrasound (>/=3.4 cm), DVSS, Rome IV, and BSFS were obtained for each patient. All imaging was interpreted by a pediatric radiologist and pediatric urologist. Primary outcomes were the association between the four diagnostic tests and KUB stool burden. Bivariate analysis of all individual variables versus KUB was performed, as well as multivariate regressions to determine if multiple measures were predictive of KUB stool burden when combined. RESULTS: Between October 2020 and May 2022, 50 patients were enrolled. All children were under the age of 18, with a median age of 8 years (IQR 3-13). 38 % were male. Median BMI-for-age-percentile was 80.8 (IQR 50.3-98.3). When comparing individual variables to KUB in bivariate analyses, it was found that RD on ultrasound is predictive of significant stool burden on KUB (p = 0.03). No other individual variables were predictive. In the multivariate analyses, no combination of tests was found to be predictive of KUB. DISCUSSION: We compared the effectiveness of four commonly used diagnostic tests in children with BBD to validate the use of KUB. In conclusion, our results support the use of RD on ultrasound as a non-radiating alternative to KUB to assess stool burden. Data also suggest that KUB for fecal load does not correlate with urinary (DVSS) or bowel (Rome IV, BSFS) symptoms in BBD, and that symptoms scores should still be used independently for diagnosis and monitoring of treatment response. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, KUB has a limited role in the diagnosis of BBD.", "PURPOSE: Pelvic ultrasound (US) has been used in various different ways to assess severity of constipation. We evaluated the use of a new US scoring system to determine if there is any correlation between symptom severity and US findings. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively on all children attending the constipation clinic from January 2007 to July 2008. All patients completed a standardised symptom severity score sheet (SSS) for constipation. US was done with the probe placed 2 cm above the pubic symphysis. A new US scoring system designed to assess the faecal loading and its effect on the bladder was used. Patients with severe symptoms were followed up with few patients requiring as many as four follow up visits. During each follow-up visit SSS and US scoring was completed. RESULTS: A total of 500 patients were studied (male 317, female 183) with a median age of 8 years (8 months, 18 years). Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software (version 15.0). Pearson's correlation was used to assess the correlation between SSS and US score. P value <0.05 was considered to represent a statistically significant correlation between symptoms and ultrasound findings. CONCLUSION: US is an easy and quick tool that can be used in the out-patient setting to assess severity of constipation. The new US scoring system is a reliable method that can be used in conjunction with clinical examination for assessing the long-term improvement of children who are undergoing treatment for chronic constipation.", "AIM: The study aimed primarily to compare the transverse rectal diameter in children with functional constipation (FC) and children without constipation in different age groups, and between cases of constipation at baseline and after treatment. Secondary aim was to determine factors that could affect the transverse rectal diameter. METHODS: A controlled prospective study, including a total of 100 children between the ages of 2 and 11 years, who were divided into 50 patients suffering from constipation according to Rome IV criteria and 50 age- and sex-matched controls. Transverse rectal diameter was measured at presentation, and after 3 months of laxative therapy and behavioural modification. RESULTS: Initial rectal diameter was significantly different between cases (3.55 cm (interquartile range, IQR), 3.2-4) and controls (2.3 cm (IQR, 1.8-2.5)), P value < 0.001, and it was also significantly different between those above and below 4 years, so a separate cut-off point for diagnosis of constipation was suggested being >3 cm for the former and >2.5 cm for the latter. After 3 months of follow-up, rectal diameter significantly reduced to become 2.6 (IQR, 2-2.8), P value < 0.001. Duration of symptoms positively correlated with rectal diameter. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound measurement of rectal diameter is an important tool to diagnose and follow-up functional constipation in children. Different values of rectal diameter are found between those above and below 4 years of age.", "PURPOSE: To evaluate bowel management for children with colorectal pathology by measuring transverse rectal diameter (TRD) and assessing fecal load with transabdominal rectal ultrasound (TRU). METHODS: Prospective case-control study of children receiving bowel management (BM) between 04/2023 and 04/2024 was done. There was inclusion of patients with Hirschsprung disease (HD), anorectal malformation (ARM) and functional constipation (FC). Patients with other congenital or neurological conditions were excluded. Control group consisted of inpatients and outpatients without abdominal complaints. FC was diagnosed according to ROM-IV-criteria. For HD and ARM, we followed a list of symptoms. To assess fecal load, we visualized the TRD using the Klijn (Klijn et al. in J Urol 172:1986-1988, 2004) method. The bladder was moderately full. The fecal load was assessed retrograde from the rectum. Follow-up was at 1/3/6 months. Secondary data were collected from medical records. Sample size calculated a priori and follow-up group with new gathered data. RESULTS: p value for TRD in all groups significant with p < 0.05 and in grouped follow-up. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound is a useful tool for assessing fecal load and helps diagnose constipation and monitor BM. Irrespective of colorectal pathology, a cut-off of 3 cm seems to discriminate between children without constipation/overload symptoms and asymptomatic patients. We present a radiation-free method for monitoring bowel management."]}
{"question": "Did the call for boycott by the Catholic bishops affect the polio vaccination coverage in Kenya in 2015?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: Polio eradication is now feasible after removal of Nigeria from the list of endemic countries and global reduction of cases of wild polio virus in 2015 by more than 80%. However, all countries must remain focused to achieve eradication. In August 2015, the Catholic bishops in Kenya called for boycott of a polio vaccination campaign citing safety concerns with the polio vaccine. We conducted a survey to establish if the coverage was affected by the boycott. METHODS: A cross sectional survey was conducted in all the 32 counties that participated in the campaign. A total of 90,157 children and 37,732 parents/guardians were sampled to determine the vaccination coverage and reasons for missed vaccination. RESULTS: The national vaccination coverage was 93% compared to 94% in the November 2014 campaign. The proportion of parents/guardians that belonged to Catholic Church was 31% compared to 7% of the children who were missed. Reasons for missed vaccination included house not being visited (44%), children not being at home at time of visit (38%), refusal by parents (12%), children being as leep (1%), and various other reasons (5%). Compared to the November 2014 campaign, the proportion of children who were not vaccinated due to parent's refusal significantly increased from 6% to 12% in August 2015. CONCLUSION: The call for boycott did not affect the campaign significantly. However, if the call for boycott is repeated in future it could have some significant negative implication to polio eradication. It is therefore important to ensure that any vaccine safety issues are addressed accordingly."]}
{"question": "Does increased patient awareness improve accrual into cancer-related clinical trials?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Oncology literature cites that only 2% to 4% of patients participate in research. Up to 85% of patients are unaware that clinical trials research is being conducted at their treatment facility or that they might be eligible to participate. OBJECTIVES: It was hypothesized that patients' satisfaction with information regarding clinical trials would improve after targeted educational interventions, and accruals to clinical trials would increase in the year following those interventions. METHODS: All new patients referred to the cancer center over a 4-month period were mailed a baseline survey to assess their knowledge of clinical research. Subsequently, educational interventions were provided, including an orientation session highlighting clinical trials, a pamphlet, and a reference to a clinical trials Web site. A postintervention survey was sent to the responders of the initial survey 3 months after the initial mailing. RESULTS: Patient satisfaction with information significantly increased after the interventions. There was no increase in subsequent enrollment in clinical trials. Patients who indicated an inclination to participate in clinical trials tended to have greater satisfaction with the information they received. CONCLUSIONS: A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The development of educational interventions may be justified, but such interventions may require prolonged implementation to establish benefit. Information relating to research may be most effectively delivered by patients' primary cancer care providers."]}
{"question": "Does airway surgery lower serum lipid levels in obstructive sleep apnea patients?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is tightly linked to increased cardiovascular disease. Surgery is an important method to treat OSA, but its effect on serum lipid levels in OSA patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effect of upper airway surgery on lipid profiles. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 113 adult patients with OSA who underwent surgery (nasal or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP]) at a major, urban, academic hospital in Beijing from 2012 to 2013 who had preoperative and postoperative serum lipid profiles. RESULTS: Serum TC (4.86+/-0.74 to 4.69+/-0.71) and LP(a) (median 18.50 to 10.90) all decreased significantly post-operatively (P<0.01, 0.01, respectively), with no changes in serum HDL, LDL, or TG (P>0.05, all). For UPPP patients (n=51), serum TC, HDL and LP(a) improved (P=0.01, 0.01,<0.01, respectively). For nasal patients (n=62), only the serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In patients with normal serum lipids at baseline, only serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In contrast, in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, the serum HDL, TG and LP(a) showed significant improvements (P=0.02, 0.03, <0.01, respectively). In patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, the serum LP(a) decreased significantly (P=0.01), with a similar trend for serum TC (P=0.06). In patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, the serum TC and LDL also decreased (P=0.02, 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery may improve blood lipid levels in patients with OSA, especially in patients with preoperative dyslipidemia, potentially yielding a major benefit in metabolism and cardiovascular sequelae. Prospective studies should examine this potential metabolic effect of airway surgery for OSA.", "OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to evaluate serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in newly diagnosed patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between April 2005 and March 2006, a total of 231 consecutive adult habitual snorers underwent polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory. Ninety-seven subjects were found suitable for hs-CRP measurement after application of the following exclusion criteria: patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, congestive cardiac failure, or smoking history, patients who were pregnant, on steroid treatment, on hormone replacement therapy, or with chronic use of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral anticoagulants and lipid-lowering drugs and patients having undergone upper airway surgery. Patients were classified as apneic [apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)>5], obese non-apneic [body mass index (BMI)>25, AHI<5] and non-obese non-apneic (BMI<25, AHI<5). C-reactive protein levels were measured in stored sera by high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassay (Biocheck, Inc. Foster City, CA, USA). After checking normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and using a square-root transformation, Pearson's and partial correlation coefficients were calculated for identified risk factors and confounders. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify variables that were independently associated with hs-CRP. RESULTS: The mean serum levels of hs-CRP were found to be 0.25+/-0.23, 0.58+/-0.55, and 0.51+/-0.37 mg/dl in non-obese non-apneics (n=23), obese non-apneics (n=45) and apneics (obese and non-obese, n=29), respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient of hs-CRP with BMI was found to be 0.25 (p=0.01), and with AHI 0.16 (p=0.12). Partial correlation analysis showed that hs-CRP levels correlated significantly with BMI after adjustment for AHI and age (r=0.22, p=0.03), while correlation with disease severity as assessed by AHI after adjustment for BMI and age was not significant (r=0.10, p=0.33). After stepwise multiple linear regression, only BMI was found to be significantly associated with serum hs-CRP levels (beta=0.02, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this first comprehensive cross-sectional study on Indian subjects, we found that obesity, and not obstructive sleep apnea, is associated with elevated serum levels of hs-CRP. No independent correlation was found between severity of OSA and hs-CRP in the present study.", "BACKGROUND: The relationship between obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and a variety of disease from obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease has been investigated previously. Reduced adiponectin levels are also associated with increased risk of these disease. However, whether serum/plasma adiponectin levels in OSAHS patients are lower than their counterparts remain controversial. Therefore, this study evaluated the association between serum/plasma adiponectin levels and OSAHS. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search to locate eligible articles published on electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, WANFANG (Chinese database), VIP (Chinese Database) and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated as effect size. Heterogeneity test was performed by Cochrane Q test and I(2) test. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis were employed to detect the sources of the heterogeneity. RevMan 5.3 and Stata 12.0 software were used in this meta-analysis for data synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 20 eligible studies with 28 databases involving 1356 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Results revealed that serum/plasma adiponectin levels in OSAHS patients were significantly lower than that in controls [SMD = - 0.71, 95% CI = - 0.92 to - 0.49, p < 0.001]. Subgroup analysis indicated that the heterogeneity would decreased when subgroup analysis was stratified by race. In addition, meta-regression analysis also suggested that the adiponectin levels were only significantly correlated with race. The removal of any independent study did not affect the pooled SMD in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: The serum/plasma adiponectin levels were significantly lower in OSAHS patients than that in control subjects, suggesting a possible role of adiponectin in OSAHS pathogenesis, deserves further studies as a potential marker of OSAHS."]}

However, whereas single measures during static conditions generally failed in linking beta E levels with psychopathology, dynamic changes of beta E in particular have been shown to be associated with spells of anxiety and depression. During alcohol withdrawal, a decreased secretion of beta E with a delayed normalization has been reported, but up to now only few data became available regarding the interaction of plasma beta E and psychopathological parameters. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis whether beta E during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, and craving. METHODS: We observed self-rated anxiety, depression, and craving during alcohol withdrawal and assessed beta E levels (RIA) in a consecutive sample of 60 alcoholics on day 1 and day 14 after onset of withdrawal, and in 30 healthy volunteers. To control for mutual interactions of beta E and the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol were also determined. RESULTS: In accordance with prior studies, beta E was significantly lowered on day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal relative to controls. Plasma levels of ACTH correlated significantly with beta E in alcoholics at both time points and in controls, without differing significantly between the groups. Self-rated anxiety, depression, and alcohol craving decreased significantly between day 1 and day 14. Levels of beta E were inversely correlated with anxiety day 1 (r=-0.58) and day 14 (r=-0.71). Partial correlation coefficients controlling for ACTH plasma levels revealed that this correlation was largely independent from ACTH. In addition, a significant inverse relationship was found between beta E and craving on day 14 (r=-0.28). No association appeared between beta E and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state."]}
{"question": "Do older patients receive adequate stroke care?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: age may predict level of care and subsequent outcome among patients with stroke. We examined fulfilment of quality-of-care criteria according to age and the possible impact of any age-related differences on short-term mortality in a population-based nationwide follow-up study in Denmark. METHODS: we identified 29,549 patients admitted with stroke between January 2003 and October 2005 in the Danish National Indicator Project (DNIP). Data on 30- and 90-day mortality were obtained from the Civil Registration System. We compared proportions of patients receiving adequate care across age groups, as measured by admission to a specialised stroke unit, administration of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, examination with CT/MR scan, assessment by a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist, or assessment of nutritional risk. Further, we estimated 30- and 90-day mortality rate ratios (MRRs) across age groups, adjusted for fulfilment of quality-of-care criteria and patient characteristics. RESULTS: the proportion of eligible patients who received adequate care declined with age for all the examined processes. The relative risk (RR) of receiving specific components of care ranged from 0.66 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60-0.73) to 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.99) when comparing patients >80 years of age with patients < or =65 years of age. Although mortality increased with age, adjusting for the age-related differences in care did not alter the magnitude of the increase. CONCLUSIONS: elderly stroke patients in Denmark receive a lower quality of care than do younger stroke patients, however, the age-related differences are modest for most examined quality-of-care criteria and do not appear to explain the higher mortality among older patients.", "BACKGROUND: National guidelines and government directives have adopted policies for urgent assessment of patients with a transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke not admitted to hospital. The risk of recurrent stroke increases substantially with age, as does the potential benefit of secondary prevention. In order to develop effective strategies for older patients, it is important to identify how stroke care is currently provided for this patient group. METHODS: Between 2004 and 2006, older patients (>75 years) referred to a neurovascular clinic were compared with younger patients (< or =75 years). Sociodemographic details, clinical features, resource use and secondary prevention in a neurovascular clinic were collected. RESULTS: Of 379 patients referred to the clinic, 129 (34%) were given a non-stroke diagnosis. Of the remaining 250 patients, 149 (60%) were < or =75 years. Median time from symptom onset to clinic appointment was similar for the two groups (24 (IQR 15-42) vs 24 (IQR 14-43) days; p = 0.58). Older patients were more likely to be in atrial fibrillation (10.1% vs 22.8%, p<0.001) and have lacunar stroke (34.7% vs 22.1%; p = 0.04). CT rates were similar in the two groups (27.8% vs 80.0%, p = 0.75). Scans were performed more quickly in younger patients (p<0.01). MRI scan rates were higher in younger patients (26% vs 4%, p<0.01), as was carotid Doppler imaging (92% vs 77%, p<0.01). There were no differences in prescribed secondary preventive treatments. Older patients experienced less delay for carotid endarterectomy (49 vs 90 days, p<0.01). Younger patients were more likely to be given advice on weight reduction (30.2% vs 12.9%, p<0.01) and diet (46.3% vs 31.7%, p = 0.02) than older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients were less likely to receive diagnostic investigations and lifestyle modification advice than younger patients. Guidelines need to be adopted to ensure prompt evidence-based stroke care in the outpatient setting.", "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Advances in understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of stroke have led to changed requirements, including the prehospital phase, for the care of patients with acute stroke. Rapid transport to a regional stroke centre is nowadays considered to be the standard for optimal quality of care. A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was undertaken in 1996 in the region of the town of Munster to test the quality of medical care provided by physicians on emergency call. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 250 of 3001 protocols (8.3%) filled in by emergency call physicians were selected in which the initial diagnosis of transitory ischaemic attack, stroke or cerebral haemorrhage had been made. Quality of patient care was assessed according to the following criteria; (1) complete medical treatment (blood sugar, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm and arterial oxygen saturation, including relevant treatment of any abnormality) (2) action time (arrival of emergency doctor within 12 min and arrival at hospital within 50 min); (3) type of the admission hospital (stroke centre defined as a hospital experienced in the treatment of stroke, with neurological and medical departments, as well as 24-hour cover for computed cranial tomography). A summated indicator of \"optimal care\" was used to determine whether the three stated criteria were met. RESULTS: Mean age of the stroke patients was 72.3 years. While the above mentioned quality criteria for the action time were met in 93.5% of patients, only 56.0% were admitted to a stroke centre, and this was significantly more often the final destination for patients under the age of 65 years than for older ones (p = 0.049). The quality indicator \"complete medical treatment\" was met for 27.2% of the transported patients. Measured according to present-day criteria, only 18.6% of patients received such optimal treatment. CONCLUSION: This analysis indicates that modern prehospital treatment of stroke patients does not reach adequate standards. In particular, it is not comprehensive. While the \"action time\" is usually adequate, there are deficiencies regarding the quality of medical care and the choice of the admission hospital. Further education for emergency physicians with respect to the management of stroke syndrome should be an integral part of any regional quality programme. The number of hospitals with adequate competence in the acute management of stroke cases is still insufficient.", "Atrial fibrillation (AF) patients may receive treatment from specialists or from general medicine physicians representing different levels of care within a structured health care system. This \"choice\" is influenced by patient flow within a health care system, patient preference, and individual access to health care resources. We analysed how the postgraduate training and work environment of treating physicians affects management decisions in AF patients. Patient characteristics and treatment decisions were analysed at the time of enrolment into the registry of the German Atrial Fibrillation NETwork (AFNET). A total of 9,577 patients were enrolled from 2004 to 2006 in 191 German centres that belonged to the following four levels of care: 13 tertiary care centres (TCC) enrolled 3,795 patients (39.6%), 58 district hospitals (DH) enrolled 2,339 patients (24.4%), 62 office-based cardiologists (OC) enrolled 2,640 patients (27.6%), and 58 general practitioners or internists (GP) enrolled 803 patients (8.4%). Patients with new-onset AF were often treated in DH. TCC treated younger patients who more often presented with paroxysmal AF. Older patients and patients in permanent AF more often received outpatient care. Consistent with recommendations, younger patients and patients with non-permanent AF received rhythm control therapy more often. In addition, the type of centre affected the decision for rhythm control. Stroke risk was similar between centre types (mean CHADS2 scores 1.6 -1.9). TCC (68.8%) and OC (73.6%) administered adequate antithrombotic therapy more often than DH (55.1%) or GP (52.0%, p<0.001 between groups). Upon multivariate analysis, enrolment by TCC or OC was associated with a 1.60 (1.20-2.12, p=0.001) fold chance for adequate antithrombotic treatment. This difference between centre types was consistent irrespective of the type of stroke risk estimation (ESC 2001 guidelines, CHADS2 score), and also consistent when the recently suggested CHA2DS2-VASc score was used to estimate stroke risk. In conclusion, management decisions in AF are influenced by the education and clinical background of treating physicians in Germany. Inpatients receive more rhythm control therapy. Adequate antithrombotic therapy is more often administered in specialist (cardiologist) centres.", "OBJECTIVES: To use data from the 2001-2 National Stroke Audit to describe the organisation of stroke units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and to see if key characteristics deemed effective from the research literature were present. DESIGN: Data were collected as part of the National Sentinel Audit of Stroke in 2001, both on the organisation and structure of inpatient stroke care and the process of care to hospitals managing stroke patients. SETTING: 240 hospitals from England, Wales and Northern Ireland took part in the 2001-2 National Stroke Audit, a response rate of over 95%. These sites audited a total of 8200 patients. AUDIT TOOL: Royal College of Physicians Intercollegiate Working Party Stroke Audit Tool. RESULTS: 73% of hospitals participating in the audit had a stroke unit but only 36% of stroke admissions spent any time on one. Only 46% of all units describing themselves as stroke units had all five organisational characteristics that previous research literature had identified as being key features, while 26% had four and 28% had three or less. Better organisation was associated with better process of care for patients, with patients managed on stroke units receiving better care than those managed in other settings. CONCLUSION: The National Service Framework for Older People set a target for all hospitals treating stroke patients to have a stroke unit by April 2004. This study suggests that in many hospitals this is being achieved without adequate resource and expertise."]}
{"question": "Is digoxin use for cardiovascular disease associated with risk of prostate cancer?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Digoxin is a commonly used medication for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias that has recently been suggested as a novel chemotherapeutic agent. Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with digoxin. We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk. METHODS: Data from a population-based case-control study of incident cases aged 35-74 years at PCa diagnosis in 2002-2005 in King County, Washington were available. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression. RESULTS: One thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10). Among those with >/=3 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years (546 cases, 380 controls), digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction of PCa risk (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98). CONCLUSION: These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.", "OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between digoxin exposure and mortality in men with prostate cancer using linked Irish National Cancer Registry and pharmacy claims data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prostate cancer cases were identified from the database and digoxin exposure at prostate cancer diagnosis was identified from prescription claims. Digoxin users were matched to non-users using a propensity score to identify men with similar cardiovascular comorbidity. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for the association between digoxin exposure and all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Analyses were repeated in the propensity score-matched cohort. Effect modification of treatment with radiation or androgen-deprivation therapy by digoxin exposure was also assessed. RESULTS: In all, 5732 men with a prostate cancer diagnosis (2001-2006) were identified (digoxin exposed, 391). The median follow-up was 4.3 years. Digoxin exposure was associated with a small non-significant increase in PCSM in the full cohort (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.91, 1.42) and the propensity. score-matched cohort (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.88, 1.57). Adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality were increased for digoxin exposed men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07, 1.43). Interactions with treatments received were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest digoxin exposure is not associated with reduced PCSM. Further investigation of other cardiac glycosides that have shown anti-cancer potential may be warranted."]}
{"question": "Does the severity of obstructive sleep apnea predict patients requiring high continuous positive airway pressure?", "retrieved_passages": ["STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate polysomnographic and anthropomorphic factors predicting need of high optimal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis. PATIENTS: Three hundred fifty-three consecutive obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients who had a successful manual CPAP titration in our sleep disorders unit. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean optimal CPAP was 9.5 +/- 2.4 cm H2O. The optimal CPAP pressure increases with an increase in OSA severity from 7.79 +/- 2.2 in the mild, to 8.7 +/- 1.8 in the moderate, and to 10.1 +/- 2.3 cm H2O in the severe OSA group. A high CPAP was defined as the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD; > or =12 cm H2O). The predictor variables included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). High CPAP was required in 2 (6.9%), 6 (5.8%), and 63 (28.6%) patients with mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. On univariate analysis, AHI, BMI, ESS score, and the proportion of males were significantly higher in those needing high CPAP. They also have a lower MSLT mean. On logistic regression, the use of high CPAP was 5.90 times more frequent (95% confidence interval 2.67-13.1) in severe OSA patients after adjustment for the other variables. The area under the receiver operator curve was 72.4%, showing that the model was adequate. CONCLUSIONS: Severe OSA patients are much more likely to need high CPAP levels. However, because of the low positive predictive value (only 28.6%), the clinical value of such information is limited. ESS and MSLT did not increase the predictive value for the need for high CPAP.", "The purpose of this study was (1) to examine the factors that account for the variability in continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) levels required to abolish obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with this disorder, and (2) to examine the feasibility of predicting the lowest effective pressure (CPAPmin) from simple anthropometric and polysomnographic variables easily available in all patients considered for home CPAP therapy. To accomplish these tasks we studied a group of 208 patients with OSA all of whom were treated with nasal CPAP at home. We first analyzed a model set of 38 patients all of whom had at least two polysomnographic studies (the diagnostic one and a subsequent one to determine CPAPmin for home use), anthropometric measurements (including body mass index, neck circumference, and waist circumference), pulmonary function measurements (lung volumes, airways resistance, and flow-volume curves), pharyngeal and glottic cross-sectional areas at functional residual capacity and residual volume, and nasal airflow resistances. We compared patients requiring CPAP > 10 cm H2O with those who required CPAP < 5 cm H2O. The high CPAP group was characterized by a greater degree of obesity, more severe sleep apnea, and more collapsible pharynx. Multiple linear regression analysis using principal components and Mallows C(P) statistics revealed that the optimal set of predictors for CPAPmin consisted of only three variables: apnea/hypopnea index, body mass index, and neck circumference. This model accounted for 76% of the variability in CPAP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PURPOSE: The pressures delivered by autotitrating continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) devices not only treat obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) effectively but also give potentially interesting physiological information about the forces impinging on the pharynx. In earlier work from this unit, we used correlations between autoCPAP pressure and both OSA severity and obesity, to construct an algorithm to estimate the fixed CPAP pressure a patient required for subsequent clinical use. We wished to discover if these relationships could be reliably extended to a much more obese group. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study in an obese population. Measurements of obesity were made, OSA severity was recorded, and the 95th centile autoCPAP pressure was recorded during 1 week of autoCPAP. Spearman's rank correlation was performed between measurements of obesity and autoCPAP pressure, and between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure. RESULTS: Fifty-four obese individuals (median body mass index (BMI) 43.0 kg/m(2)), 52 % of whom had OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) >/= 15), had a median 95th centile autoCPAP pressure of 11.8 cmH2O. We found no significant correlation between autoCPAP pressure and neck circumference, waist circumference or BMI. There was a moderate correlation between autoCPAP pressure and OSA severity (AHI r = 0.34, p = 0.02; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) r = 0.48, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this population, neither BMI nor neck circumference nor waist circumference is predictive of autoCPAP pressure. Therefore, the previously derived algorithm does not adequately predict the fixed CPAP pressure for subsequent clinical use in these obese individuals. In addition, some subjects without OSA generated high autoCPAP pressures, and thus, the correlation between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure was only moderate.", "BACKGROUND: Studies show that the therapeutic CPAP pressure is associated with oral appliance (OA) treatment outcome in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. However, these studies included either CPAP adherent patients using fixed pressure devices, or partly CPAP non-adherent patients using fixed pressure or auto-adjusting (auto-CPAP) devices. In many countries, auto-CPAP is predominately used, and only those non-adherent to therapy need a change to OA. Therefore, studies examining the relationship between CPAP pressures and OA treatment outcome should focus on patients non-adherent to auto-CPAP. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to assess if CPAP pressures predicted OA treatment outcome in patients non-adherent to auto-CPAP therapy. METHODS: The OA treatment responders and non-responders were defined by two success criteria ((1) AHI < 5; (2) 5 </= AHI < 10 and > 50% AHI reduction). Logistic regression analyses were performed for CPAP pressures and baseline variables. ROC curve analyses were used to identify CPAP pressure cutoff values, alone and combined with other explanatory variables, predicting the OA treatment outcome. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with moderate or severe OSA were included. Maximum CPAP pressures (CPAPmax) were higher in non-responders by both criteria and were, together with baseline AHI, associated with the OA treatment outcome in multivariate regression analyses. ROC curves identified an optimal CPAPmax cutoff of 12 cm H(2)O, corresponding to a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.85 in predicting non-response using criterion 1. A prediction model combining CPAPmax > 12 and baseline AHI >/= 30 had a PPV of 1.0 for non-response by both criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Maximum CPAP pressure was a moderate predictor of OA treatment outcome, but combined with baseline AHI, the ability to identify OA non-responders was high.", "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Upper airway collapsibility is a key determinant of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which can influence the efficacy of certain non-continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatments for OSA. However, there is no simple way to measure this variable clinically. The present study aimed to develop a clinically implementable tool to evaluate the collapsibility of a patient's upper airway. METHODS: Collapsibility, as characterized by the passive pharyngeal critical closing pressure (Pcrit), was measured in 46 patients with OSA. Associations were investigated between Pcrit and data extracted from patient history and routine polysomnography, including CPAP titration. RESULTS: Therapeutic CPAP level, demonstrated the strongest relationship to Pcrit (r2=0.51, p < .001) of all the variables investigated including apnea-hypopnea index, body mass index, sex, and age. Patients with a mildly collapsible upper airway (Pcrit </= -2 cmH2O) had a lower therapeutic CPAP level (6.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 10.3 +/- 0.4 cmH2O, p < .001) compared to patients with more severe collapsibility (Pcrit > -2 cmH2O). A therapeutic CPAP level </=8.0 cmH2O was sensitive (89%) and specific (84%) for detecting a mildly collapsible upper airway. When applied to the independent validation data set (n = 74), this threshold maintained high specificity (91%) but reduced sensitivity (75%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that a patient's therapeutic CPAP requirement shares a strong predictive relationship with their Pcrit and may be used to accurately differentiate OSA patients with mild airway collapsibility from those with moderate-to-severe collapsibility. Although this relationship needs to be confirmed prospectively, our findings may provide clinicians with better understanding of an individual patient's OSA phenotype, which ultimately could assist in determining which patients are most likely to respond to non-CPAP therapies."]}
{"question": "Preoperative platelet count in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: is it a prognostic factor?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Platelet count is inversely related to prognosis in many cancers; however, its role in esophageal cancer is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of preoperative platelet count in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: From January 2006 to December 2008, a retrospective analysis of 425 consecutive patients with ESCC was conducted. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for survival prediction was plotted to verify the optimum cutoff point for preoperative platelet count. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic parameters. RESULTS: A ROC curve for survival prediction was plotted to verify the optimum cutoff point for platelet count, which was 205 (x 10(9)/L). Patients with platelet count </= 205 had a significantly better 5-year survival than patients with a platelet count >205 (60.7 vs. 31.6 %, P < 0.001). The 5-year survival of patients either with platelet count </= 205 or >205 were similar (68.6 vs. 58.8 %, P = 0.085) when the nodes were negative. However, the 5-year survival of patients with platelet count </= 205 was better than that of patients with a platelet count >205 when the nodes were involved (32.0 vs. 12.7 %, P = 0.004). Multivariate analysis showed that platelet count (P = 0.013), T grade (P = 0.017), and N staging (P < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (x10(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.", "BACKGROUND/AIM: Thrombocytosis is found to be associated with unfavorable prognosis in esophageal carcinoma. Platelets produce thymidine phosphorylase which is a platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor with angiogenic activity. Increased platelet count may be translated into enhanced tumor growth. We examined the relation between platelet count and several prognostic variables in patients with esophageal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and eighty-one cases with esophageal cancer that underwent esophagectomy in a referral cancer institute during a 5-year period were studied retrospectively. The relation between preoperative platelet count and patient age, gender, site of tumor, presence of multiple cancers and clinicopathological characteristics including histological type, tumor size, depth of penetration (T), lymph node involvement (N), distant metastasis (M), degree of differentiation, presence of vascular, lymphatic and perineural invasion was examined. RESULTS: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) constituted 93% and adenocarcinoma 7% of cases. Most of patients were in stage III, followed by stage II. The mean platelet count was 245+/-76 (Chi 10(9)/L). There was no statistically significant correlation between platelet counts with prognostic factors except a weak linear correlation between platelet count and and tumor size (P = 0.03, Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.16). Patients with adenocarcinoma had a higher platelet count than those with SCC (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Platelet count does not correlate with prognostic factors in esophageal cancer. However, it is significantly different between SCC and adenocarcinoma of esophagus.", "BACKGROUND: We analyzed perioperative platelet counts as a potential clinical marker for survival after transthoracic en bloc resection for esophageal cancer. Recent data described preoperative thrombocytosis in malignancies to be associated with poor prognosis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis from a prospective database (1997-2006) was performed for 291 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer who underwent transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy and extended lymphadenectomy. Squamous cell cancer was found in 47.0% and adenocarcinoma in 50.9% (2.1% had rare histologies). Neoadjuvant chemoradiation was performed in 152 (52%) patients. Platelet counts before surgery and on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 10, and 30 were evaluated. We used the published cutoff value of 293 x 10(9)/l (mean of 80 healthy controls +/- standard deviation) for platelet counts. RESULTS: High platelet counts before surgery missed significance for poorer survival (p = 0.054). Following a perioperative fall in thrombocytes, a significant rise at POD 10 after surgery was evident. Platelet counts of more than 293 x 10(9)/l at this time correlated with a significantly improved survival rate (p = 0.027). Patients with no increase in thrombocytes until POD 10 had significantly poorer survival (p = 0.012). Multivariate analysis confirmed that a thrombocyte increase between the preoperative count and that on POD 10 is an independent prognostic indicator (p = 0.035) for patients with completely (R0) resected tumors. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in platelet counts measured on POD 10 following transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy and extended lymphadenectomy is an independent prognostic indicator for improved survival in patients with esophageal cancer.", "The aim of this study is to search the most powerful prognostic factor from routine blood test for esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) patients. Multiple laboratory tests were evaluated including those reflecting red blood cell parameters (hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and red blood cell distribution width (RDW)), platelet morphological parameters (mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet count (PLT)), blood coagulation status (D-dimer), and tumor biomarker (CA19-9). Known inflammatory indices (NLR and PLR) were also calculated. A total of 468 patients who were diagnosed with ESCC between December 2005 and December 2008 were retrospectively analyzed in this study. By utilizing univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses, we found that PLT and MPV were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of ESCC patients, with optimal cutoff values of 212 and 10.6, respectively. Moreover, the combination of the preoperative PLT and MPV (COP-MPV) was calculated as follows: patients with both PLT (>/=212 x 10(9) L(-1)) and MPV (>/=10.6 fL) elevation were assigned a score of 2, and patients with one or neither were assigned a score of 1 and 0. The COP-MPV was an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio (HR) 0.378, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.241 to 0.593, P < 0.001, 0/2) and DFS (HR 0.341, 95 % CI 0.218 to 0.534, P < 0.001, 0/2) in multivariate analyses. In subgroup analyses for early (stages I and II) and locally (stage III) advanced stage patients, COP-MPV was found significantly associated with OS and DFS in each group (P = 0.025 and P = 0.018 for OS and P = 0.029 and P = 0.002 for DFS). In conclusion, we considered that COP-MPV is a promising predictor for postoperative survival in ESCC patients.", "INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant treatment is currently the gold standard for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Several studies have examined the value of blood count-based indexes for predicting short- and long-term outcomes after esophagectomy for ESCC, but the relative predictive value of pretreatment, preoperative, and postoperative indexes has not yet been examined. METHODS: This study included 320 patients with thoracic ESCC who underwent subtotal esophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy at our institution. A total of 19 candidate blood parameters were measured before neoadjuvant treatment as well as preoperatively and postoperatively. The ability of the parameters to predict postoperative complications, overall survival (OS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: ROC curve analysis indicated that preoperative platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) had the best predictive value with an optimal cutoff value of 166. Patients with high preoperative PLR (>/=166) had significantly shorter OS and RFS and significantly higher incidences of hematogenous recurrence and postoperative pneumonia compared with patients with low preoperative PLR (&lt;166). In multivariate analysis, high preoperative PLR and high preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen level were independent predictors of poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Preoperative PLR is a good predictor of short- and long-term prognosis in patients with advanced ESCC who receive neoadjuvant treatment followed by radical resection."]}

AIMS: 1) to verify the presence of a statistically significant difference between ADMA levels in young adults born preterm at extremely low birth weight (<1000 g; ex-ELBW) and those of a control group of healthy adults born at term (C) and 2) to seek correlations between ADMA levels in ex-ELBW and anthropometric and clinical parameters (gender, chronological age, gestational age, birth weight, and duration of stay in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit). METHODS: Thirty-two ex-ELBW subjects (11 males [M] and 21 females [F], aged 17-29years, mean age 22.2 +/- 2.3 years) were compared with 25 C (7 M and 18F). ADMA levels were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography with highly sensitive laser fluorescent detection. RESULTS: ADMA levels were reduced in ex-ELBW subjects compared to C (0.606+0.095 vs 0.562+0.101 mumol/L, p<0.05), and significantly correlated inversely with gestational age (r=-0.61, p<0.00001) and birth weight (r=-0.57, p<0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk."]}
{"question": "Can fractional lasers enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It has been shown in vitro that pretreatment of skin with fractional lasers enhances transdermal delivery of drugs. The aim of this study is to demonstrate in vivo firstly that laser enhances transdermal drug absorption and secondly that this can be manipulated by altering laser settings. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four pigs were used in the IACUC approved animal study. On day 0, 5 g of 4% topical lidocaine was applied under occlusion for 60 minutes to a 400 cm(2) area on the abdomen. Blood was drawn at 0, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. On day 7, the Er:YAG laser was used at 500, 250, 50, and 25 microm ablative depth, respectively, over a 400 cm(2) area on the abdomen. Five grams of 4% topical lidocaine was applied immediately with occlusion for 60 minutes, and then removed. Blood was drawn at 0, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. The serum was extracted and analyzed for lidocaine and its metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX). RESULTS: Serum levels of lidocaine and MEGX were undetectable in untreated skin. Following laser treatment both lidocaine and MEGX were detectable. Peak levels of lidocaine were significantly higher (P = 0.0002) at 250 microm (0.62 mg/L), compared to 500 microm (0.45 mg/L), 50 microm (0.48 mg/L), and 25 microm (0.3 mg/L). Peak levels of MEGX were significantly higher (P </= 0.0001) at 250 microm (0.048 mg/L), compared to 500 microm (0.018 mg/L), 50 microm (0.036 mg/L), and 25 microm (0.0144 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit."]}
{"question": "Can clinical supervision sustain our workforce in the current healthcare landscape?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Clinical supervision is widely recognised as a mechanism for providing professional support, professional development and clinical governance for healthcare workers. There have been limited studies about the effectiveness of clinical supervision for allied health and minimal studies conducted within the Australian health context. The aim of the present study was to identify whether clinical supervision was perceived to be effective by allied health professionals and to identify components that contributed to effectiveness. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire, administered through the health service's intranet. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with community allied health workers (n = 82) 8 months after implementation of structured clinical supervision. Demographic data (age, gender), work-related history (profession employment level, years of experience), and supervision practice (number and length of supervision sessions) were collected through an online survey. The outcome measure, clinical supervision effectiveness, was operationalised using the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale-26 (MCSS-26). Data were analysed with Pearson correlation (r) and independent sample t-tests (t) with significance set at 0.05 (ie the probability of significant difference set at P < 0.05). RESULTS: The length of the supervision sessions (r(s) >/= 0.44), the number of sessions (r(s) >/= 0.35) and the total period supervision had been received (r(s) >/= 0.42) were all significantly positively correlated with the MCSS-26 domains of clinical supervision effectiveness. Three individual variables, namely 'receiving clinical supervision', 'having some choice in the allocation of clinical supervisor' and 'having a completed clinical supervision agreement', were also significantly associated with higher total MCSS-26 scores (P(s) < 0.014). CONCLUSION: The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "AIM: The objective of this review is to identify and synthesize the literature on clinical nursing education models in rural settings, with the goal of developing a better understanding of effective clinical education models suitable for rural nursing education. BACKGROUND: Clinical education is an integral part of nursing education, yet very little clinical education occurs in rural and remote areas. This leaves the rural landscape vulnerable to inadequate health care staffing because many graduates will begin their nursing practice in the geographical areas where they studied. The rural nursing workforce is currently insufficient to meet the health care needs of rural populations. This insufficiency is likely to worsen because statistical trends suggest that rural and remote communities might be among the worst affected by the global nursing shortage. Many new graduate nurses are ill prepared for rural nursing practice, primarily due to limited exposure to rural nursing content and rural clinical experiences in their entry-to-practice education. Increasing opportunities for nursing students to learn in rural clinical settings will likely support the recruitment and retention of nurses in rural practice. Despite the key role of rural nursing education in sustaining the rural health workforce, little is known about rural clinical learning in nursing education. DESIGN: A scoping review. METHODS: This scoping review was conducted using the steps outlined by Arksey and O'Malley with updated methodological guidance from the Joanna Briggs Institute. RESULTS: Of 1880 potential data sources, 82 were included in data analysis. Although no distinct model of rural clinical nursing education could be identified, several features of clinical nursing education were described in the context of rural clinical learning. Preceptorship was the most used mentorship/clinical supervision model (n=41). The most common placement design was a block model design (n=41) lasting between one and 16 weeks, with most learners engaging in episodic care with individual clients (n=42). Interestingly, 24 sources reported learners engaging in rural clinical education across multiple contexts (e.g., acute care, home care, and primary care). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest there exists great variability in rural clinical learning opportunities for nursing students. Academic practice partnerships could continue to be leveraged to provide learners with rural clinical education that meets the needs of both the educational institution as well as the rural communities in which learning takes place. An area of further research would be to focus on formal evaluation of the effectiveness of clinical education models in the rural context."]}
{"question": "Is the determination of specific IgE against components using ISAC 112 a reproducible technique?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The ImmunoCAP ISAC 112 is a fluoro-immunoassay that allows detection of specific IgE to 112 molecular components from 51 allergenic sources. We studied the reliability of this technique intra- and inter- assay, as well as inter-batch- and inter-laboratory-assay. METHODS: Twenty samples were studied, nineteen sera from polysensitized allergic patients, and the technique calibrator provided by the manufacturer (CTR02). We measured the sIgE from CTR02 and three patients' sera ten times in the same and in different assays. Furthermore, all samples were tested in two laboratories and with two batches of ISAC kit. To evaluate the accuracy of ISAC 112, we contrasted the determinations of CTR02 calibrator with their expected values by T Student test. To analyse the precision, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of the 15 allergens that generate the calibration curve, and to analyse the repeatability and the reproducibility, we calculated the intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) to each allergen. RESULTS: The results obtained for CTR02 were similar to those expected in 7 of 15 allergens that generate the calibration curve, whereas in 8 allergens the results showed significant differences. The mean CV obtained in the CTR02 determinations was of 9.4%, and the variability of sera from patients was of 22.9%. The agreement in the intra- and inter-assay analysis was very good to 94 allergens and good to one. In the inter-batch analyse, we obtained a very good agreement to 82 allergens, good to 14, moderate to 5 allergens, poor to one, and bad to 1 allergen. In the inter-laboratory analyse, we obtained a very good agreement to 73 allergens, good to 22, moderate to 6 and poor to two allergens. CONCLUSION: The allergen microarray immunoassay, ISAC 112, is a repeatable and reproducible in vitro diagnostic tool for determination of sIgE beyond the own laboratory."]}
{"question": "Is the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia a prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcome?", "retrieved_passages": ["INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and how it relates to other prognostic factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study from December 2009 to February 2012 with analysis of demographic, clinical and biochemical data from two obstetric day assessment units in hospitals in Southeast Scotland. We included 717 pregnant women, with singleton pregnancies after 20 weeks' gestation, referred for evaluation of suspected preeclampsia and having their first ACR performed. The ability of ACR to predict future outcomes was assessed in both univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. The latter assessed its prognostic value independent of (adjusting for) existing prognostic factors. Primary outcome measures were maternal and neonatal composite adverse outcomes, and a secondary outcome was gestation at delivery. RESULTS: In all, 204 women (28.5%) experienced a composite adverse maternal outcome and 146 women (20.4%) experienced a composite adverse neonatal outcome. Multivariate analysis of log-transformed ACR demonstrated that a 1-unit increase in log ACR is associated with an increased odds of adverse maternal [odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45-1.80] and adverse neonatal (odds ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.29) composite outcomes, and with reduced gestational age at delivery (coefficient: -0.46, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.38). CONCLUSIONS: ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model."]}
{"question": "Estimated fetal weight by ultrasound: a modifiable risk factor for cesarean delivery?", "retrieved_passages": ["Ultrasound is a valuable tool commonly used in the delivery room. It has multiple applications. The objective of this study was to investigate whether systematic fetal weight estimation by ultrasound in the delivery room increases the risk of cesarean delivery. Monocentric cohort study. All parturients with singleton pregnancies who gave birth full-term at = 39 weeks were enrolled in the study. We excluded all patients with a contraindication to vaginal birth as well as those in whom fetal weight estimation (FWE) by ultrasound on day of delivery was deemed necessary in making obstetric decision. Parturients enrolled in the study were divided into two groups: - G1: parturients who systematically underwent FWE - G2: parturients who never underwent FWE. We compared cesarean delivery rate with adjustment for potentially confounding factors according to logistic regression. 838 parturients were enrolled in the study. Prematurity, FWE and weight at birth were risk factors for cesarean delivery. After adjustment for confounding factors, FWE by ultrasound systematically performed in G1 proved to be an independent risk factor for cesarean delivery with OR = 3.8 (CI 95% = [2.67 to 5.48]). This risk increased significantly with estimated fetal weight (EFW): OR=2,27(CI 95;1,15-4,47; p=0.018) for 3500 < EFW < 4000g and OR = 10.64 (CI 95; 4.28 to 26.41; p < 0.001 ) for EFW > 4000 g. FWE by ultrasound systematically performed in the delivery room represents an independent and potentially modifiable risk factor for cesarean delivery.", "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether knowledge of ultrasound-obtained estimated fetal weight (US-EFW) is a risk factor for cesarean delivery (CD). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort from a single center in 2009-2010 of singleton, term live births. CD rates were compared for women with and without US-EFW within 1 month of delivery and adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Of the 2329 women in our cohort, 50.2% had US-EFW within 1 month of delivery. CD was significantly more common for women with US-EFW (15.7% vs 10.2%; P < .001); after we controlled for confounders, US-EFW remained an independent risk factor for CD (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.9). The risk increased when US-EFW was >3500 g (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.7). CONCLUSION: Knowledge of US-EFW, above and beyond the impact of fetal size itself, increases the risk of CD. Acquisition of US-EFW near term appears to be an independent and potentially modifiable risk factor for CD.", "OBJECTIVES: To develop a machine-learning (ML) model for prediction of shoulder dystocia (ShD) and to externally validate the model's predictive accuracy and potential clinical efficacy in optimizing the use of Cesarean delivery in the context of suspected macrosomia. METHODS: We used electronic health records (EHR) from the Sheba Medical Center in Israel to develop the model (derivation cohort) and EHR from the University of California San Francisco Medical Center to validate the model's accuracy and clinical efficacy (validation cohort). Subsequent to application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the derivation cohort included 686 singleton vaginal deliveries, of which 131 were complicated by ShD, and the validation cohort included 2584 deliveries, of which 31 were complicated by ShD. For each of these deliveries, we collected maternal and neonatal delivery outcomes coupled with maternal demographics, obstetric clinical data and sonographic fetal biometry. Biometric measurements and their derived estimated fetal weight were adjusted (aEFW) according to gestational age at delivery. A ML pipeline was utilized to develop the model. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, the ML model provided significantly better prediction than did the current clinical paradigm based on fetal weight and maternal diabetes: using nested cross-validation, the area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) of the model was 0.793 +/- 0.041, outperforming aEFW combined with diabetes (AUC = 0.745 +/- 0.044, P = 1e(-16) ). The following risk modifiers had a positive beta that was > 0.02, i.e. they increased the risk of ShD: aEFW (beta = 0.164), pregestational diabetes (beta = 0.047), prior ShD (beta = 0.04), female fetal sex (beta = 0.04) and adjusted abdominal circumference (beta = 0.03). The following risk modifiers had a negative beta that was < -0.02, i.e. they were protective of ShD: adjusted biparietal diameter (beta = -0.08) and maternal height (beta = -0.03). In the validation cohort, the model outperformed aEFW combined with diabetes (AUC = 0.866 vs 0.784, P = 0.00007). Additionally, in the validation cohort, among the subgroup of 273 women carrying a fetus with aEFW >/= 4000 g, the aEFW had no predictive power (AUC = 0.548), and the model performed significantly better (0.775, P = 0.0002). A risk-score threshold of 0.5 stratified 42.9% of deliveries to the high-risk group, which included 90.9% of ShD cases and all cases accompanied by maternal or newborn complications. A more specific threshold of 0.7 stratified only 27.5% of the deliveries to the high-risk group, which included 63.6% of ShD cases and all those accompanied by newborn complications. CONCLUSION: We developed a ML model for prediction of ShD and, in a different cohort, externally validated its performance. The model predicted ShD better than did estimated fetal weight either alone or combined with maternal diabetes, and was able to stratify the risk of ShD and neonatal injury in the context of suspected macrosomia.

Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.", "OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether antenatal recognition of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses with normal maternal and fetal Doppler values delivered after 34 weeks' gestation is associated with changes in the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 313 singleton SGA fetuses and 313 appropriate-for-gestational-age control fetuses born between 34 and 42 weeks' gestation from 2009 to 2012. Small-for-gestational-age fetuses identified before delivery (n = 124), for whom antenatal surveillance was performed until delivery (estimated fetal weight twice weekly and Doppler evaluation of the fetal compartment once weekly), were compared to those not identified at delivery (n = 189). The latter group did not undergo antenatal surveillance for several reasons (women for whom a sonographic evaluation or gynecologic consultation was not performed in the third trimester and incorrect sonographic biometric evaluation in the third trimester). Main outcome measures were mode of delivery, perinatal complications, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. The risk of serious fetal complications was assessed by cross-tabulation analysis adjusted for gestational age and degree of SGA. RESULTS: Prenatally recognized SGA fetuses were smaller and delivered earlier than unrecognized SGA fetuses (P< .05). Fetal acidemia (pH <7.10) was significantly more common in unrecognized SGA fetuses (3.7% versus 0%). Small-for-gestational-age fetuses at or below the 3rd percentile were more commonly recognized prenatally and hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. Unrecognized SGA fetuses also had worse fetal outcomes compared to controls (P< .05). Recognized and unrecognized SGA fetuses were born significantly more frequently by cesarean delivery (P < .05). No significant differences in perinatal outcomes were found between recognized SGA deliveries with or without medical induction. CONCLUSIONS: Antenatal recognition of SGA fetuses delivered after 34 weeks' gestation might improve perinatal outcomes. Medical induction of labor did not modify neonatal outcomes among prenatally recognized SGA fetuses."]}
{"question": "Does Mammographic Density have an Impact on the Margin Re-excision Rate After Breast-Conserving Surgery?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Limited and conflicting data exist on an association between mammographic density (MD) and re-excision rates after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Additionally, the correlation of MD with resection of unnecessary margins during initial BCS is unknown. METHODS: All women with a diagnosis of breast cancer from 2003 to 2012 and enrolled in a larger study on MD were evaluated. Operative and pathology reports were reviewed to determine margin resection and involvement. Mammographic density was determined both by breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) classification and by an automated software program (Volpara Solutions). Additional margins were deemed unnecessary if the lumpectomy specimen margin was free of invasive tumor [>/=2 mm for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] or if further re-excision was needed. RESULTS: Of 655 patients, 398 (60.8%) had BCS, whereas 226 (34.5%) underwent initial mastectomy. The women with denser breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4) underwent initial mastectomy more frequently than the women with less dense breasts (40.0 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0118). Of the patients with BCS, 166 (41.7%) required separate re-excision. Additional margins were taken during BCS in 192 (48.2%) patients, with 151 (78.6%) proving to be unnecessary. In the bivariable analysis, the patients with denser breasts according to BI-RADS classification and volumetric density showed a trend toward requiring more frequent re-excision, but this association was not seen in the multivariable analysis. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density. In the multivariate analysis, the re-excision rates increased with DCIS (p < 0.0003) and decreased with resection of additional margins (p = 0.0043). CONCLUSIONS: Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS."]}

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, BioMed Central, CENTRAL, and Google scholar databases were searched up to April 1 2020 for randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing US-guided and conventional arthrocentesis. RESULTS: Four RCTs were included. Pooled analysis did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in pain or maximal mouth opening (MMO) scores after 1 week and 1 month of follow-up between US-guided and conventional arthrocentesis. Studies also reported data on intra-operative needle relocations and operating time but with conflicting results. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the use of US during arthrocentesis may not improve postoperative pain and MMO in the short term. Data on intra-operative outcomes are scarce and conflicting for any definitive conclusions. Further high-quality adequately powered RCTs are required to strengthen current evidence.", "A study was carried out on 50 patients who had undergone temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery because of chronic joint pain, limited mouth opening, and joint noise. These patients were diagnosed as having internal derangement (disc displacement) of the TMJ. The corrective surgical technique consisted of removing 2-4 mm of the top of the condyle, freeing of the displaced disc, and securely suturing it atop the condylar stump and to the lateral capsule. A three-month period of physiotherapy was done for all patients to rehabilitate the joint. Results have shown that the patients' preoperative signs and symptoms were resolved with no recurrence.", "Arthrotomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were carried out on 50 temporomandibular joints (TMJs) in 48 patients who were being considered for surgery for clinically diagnosed internal derangement. The patients presented over a 4-year period with pain and dysfunction which had failed to respond to conservative management. Open surgery was carried out on all TMJs and operative findings compared with the results of imaging. The clinical diagnosis of internal derangement was confirmed in every case by imaging and at surgery. Arthrotomography over-diagnosed non-reducibility of an anteriorly displaced meniscus and perforation. MRI over-diagnosed non-reducibility to a lesser extent and under-diagnosed perforation. MRI demonstrated neither bony changes nor adhesions. Dynamic arthrotomography produced the best images of meniscal derangement in function and the pre-arthrogram tomograms were the best indicator of osseous abnormality. Arthrotomography was the preferred imaging technique.", "An estimated 8 to 15% of women, and 3 to 10% of men currently suffer from Temporomandibular disorders, and it has been reported that sounds are a common finding and have been observed in 28% to 50% of the adult population; sounds are almost always connected to \"internal derangements\" a condition in which the articular disk displaced from its position on the mandibular condyle. Due to the multifactorial etiology of temporomandibular joint dysfunction, any accurate diagnosis based on clinical examination alone often proves to be difficult, so a clinical examination should be utilized together with other imaging methods to determine the relationship between the disk and condyle before and after treatment. In general, management of temporomandibular joint-related conditions is necessary when pain or dysfunction is present, so many surgical or nonsurgical methods of treatment have been reported. The Occlusal splint is 1 of the most widespread treatment it induces a slight vertical condylar distraction and eliminates the occlusal factor, which can be responsible for Temporomandibular joint disturbances, removing the influence of the teeth on the joint position by the slight distraction of the joint which, in turn, enables damaged connective tissue to heal.", "Temporomandibular disorders are common, especially in young to middle-aged women, and most settle with supportive treatment. Imaging is indicated for the small percentage of cases that do not respond to conservative management and when the diagnosis is no doubt. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a bilateral synovial articulation between the mandible and skull base. It has an intra-articular disc dividing the joint into superior and inferior compartments and the articular surfaces are lined with fibrocartilage. The normal imaging anatomy of the TMJ is described and illustrated. Different movements occur in each joint compartments: a hinge movement in the inferior joint space and translation or gliding in the superior joint space. Internal derangement is the commonest disorder affecting the TMJ and is most commonly due to disc displacement, followed by osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritides. The imaging findings, primarily on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), of internal derangement and less common disorders of the joint, are reviewed and illustrated. Optimal imaging protocols are discussed with detailed reporting guidelines."]}
{"question": "Is intensive chemotherapy safe for rural cancer patients?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: To provide equality of cancer care to rural patients, Townsville Cancer Centre administers intensive chemotherapy regimens to rural patients with node-positive breast and metastatic colorectal cancers at the same doses as urban patients. Side-effects were usually managed by rural general practitioners locally. AIM: The aim is to determine the safety of this practice by comparing the profile of serious adverse events and dose intensities between urban and rural patients at the Townsville Cancer Centre. METHOD: A retrospective audit was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal and node-positive breast cancers during a 24-month period. Fisher's exact test was used for analysis. Rurality was determined as per rural, remote and metropolitan classification. RESULTS: Of the 121 patients included, 70 and 51 patients had breast and colon cancers respectively. The urban versus rural patient split among all patients, breast and colorectal cancer subgroups was 68 versus 53, 43 versus 27 and 25 versus 26 respectively. A total of 421 cycles was given with dose intensity of >95% for breast cancer in both groups (P > 0.05). Rate of febrile neutropenia was 9.3% versus 7.4% (P = 0.56). For XELOX, rate of diarrhoea was 20% versus 19% (P = 0.66) and rate of vomiting was 20% versus 11% (P = 0.11). Only two patients were transferred to Townsville for admission.

SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The epidemiological data pertaining to demography and risk factors for carcinoma breast were analyzed retrospectively in patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital of North India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hospital records of 304 patients admitted for over a period of five years (January 1998 to December 2002) were used for data analysis. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Paired T-test. RESULTS: Mean age of our female breast cancer patients was found to be lower compared to the western world, with an average difference of one decade. A majority of the patients were from a rural background and had a longer duration of symptoms compared to urban patients. Lump in the breast was a dominant symptom. Familial breast cancer was uncommon. Left sided breast cancer was slightly preponderant. Screening by mammography and staging procedures such as bone scan, Computed Tomography (CT) scan, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were sparsely used. The most common histology was infiltrating duct carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Modified radical mastectomy was found to be a safe operative procedure. Breast conservative surgery, although considered the gold standard in early breast cancer, was found unsuitable for our patients, due to the social background and lack of intensive radiotherapy and chemotherapy backup. Infiltrating duct carcinoma was more commonly associated with positive lymph nodes compared to other histopathologies. Cases operated by surgical oncologists had better axillary clearance.

{"question": "Does implant coating with antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Implant-related infections represent one of the most severe complications in orthopaedics. A fast-resorbable, antibacterial-loaded hydrogel may reduce or prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation of implanted biomaterials. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: (1) Is a fast-resorbable hydrogel able to deliver antibacterial compounds in vitro? (2) Can a hydrogel (alone or antibacterial-loaded) coating on implants reduce bacterial colonization? And (3) is intraoperative coating feasible and resistant to press-fit implant insertion? METHODS: We tested the ability of Disposable Antibacterial Coating (DAC) hydrogel (Novagenit Srl, Mezzolombardo, Italy) to deliver antibacterial agents using spectrophotometry and a microbiologic assay. Antibacterial and antibiofilm activity were determined by broth microdilution and a crystal violet assay, respectively. Coating resistance to press-fit insertion was tested in rabbit tibias and human femurs. RESULTS: Complete release of all tested antibacterial compounds was observed in less than 96 hours. Bactericidal and antibiofilm effect of DAC hydrogel in combination with various antibacterials was shown in vitro. Approximately 80% of the hydrogel coating was retrieved on the implant after press-fit insertion. CONCLUSIONS: Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A fast-resorbable, antibacterial-loaded hydrogel coating may help prevent implant-related infections in orthopaedics. However, further validation in animal models and properly controlled human studies is required."]}
{"question": "Combining process indicators to evaluate quality of care for surgical patients with colorectal cancer: are scores consistent with short-term outcome?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To determine if composite measures based on process indicators are consistent with short-term outcome indicators in surgical colorectal cancer care. DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of consistency between composite measures based on process indicators and outcome indicators for 85 Dutch hospitals. SETTING: The Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit database, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 4732 elective patients with colon carcinoma and 2239 with rectum carcinoma treated in 85 hospitals were included in the analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All available process indicators were aggregated into five different composite measures. The association of the different composite measures with risk-adjusted postoperative mortality and morbidity was analysed at the patient and hospital level. RESULTS: At the patient level, only one of the composite measures was negatively associated with morbidity for rectum carcinoma. At the hospital level, a strong negative association was found between composite measures and hospital mortality and morbidity rates for rectum carcinoma (p<0.05), and hospital morbidity rates for colon carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: For individual patients, a high score on the composite measures based on process indicators is not associated with better short-term outcome. However, at the hospital level, a good score on the composite measures based on process indicators was consistent with more favourable risk-adjusted short-term outcome rates."]}
{"question": "Is the ability to perform transurethral resection of the prostate influenced by the surgeon's previous experience?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of the urologist's experience on the surgical results and complications of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate without the use of a video camera were randomly allocated into three groups according to the urologist's experience: a urologist having done 25 transurethral resections of the prostate (Group I - 24 patients); a urologist having done 50 transurethral resections of the prostate (Group II - 24 patients); a senior urologist with vast transurethral resection of the prostate experience (Group III - 19 patients). The following were recorded: the weight of resected tissue, the duration of the resection procedure, the volume of irrigation used, the amount of irrigation absorbed and the hemoglobin and sodium levels in the serum during the procedure. RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups in the amount of irrigation fluid used per operation, the amount of irrigation fluid absorbed or hematocrit and hemoglobin variation during the procedure. The weight of resected tissue per minute was approximately four times higher in group III than in groups I and II. The mean absorbed irrigation fluid was similar between the groups, with no statistical difference between them (p=0.24). Four patients (6%) presented with TUR syndrome, without a significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION: The senior urologist was capable of resecting four times more tissue per time unit than the more inexperienced surgeons. Therefore, a surgeon's experience may be important to reduce the risk of secondary TURP due to recurring adenomas or adenomas that were incompletely resected. However, the incidence of complications was the same between the three groups."]}
{"question": "Is there a differential in the dental health of new recruits to the British Armed Forces?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND AIM: Figures from the British Defence Dental Services reveal that serving personnel in the British Army have a persistently lower level of dental fitness than those in the Royal Navy or the Royal Air Force. No research had been undertaken to ascertain if this reflects the oral health of recruits joining each Service. This study aimed to pilot a process for collecting dental and sociodemographic data from new recruits to each Service and examine the null hypothesis that no differences in dental health existed. METHOD: Diagnostic criteria were developed, a sample size calculated and data collected at the initial training establishments of each Service. RESULTS: Data for 432 participants were entered into the analysis. Recruits in the Army sample had a significantly greater prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource need than either of the other two Services. Army recruits had a mean number of 2.59 (2.08, 3.09) decayed teeth per recruit, compared to 1.93 (1.49, 2.39 p <0.01) in Royal Navy recruits and 1.26 (0.98, 1.53 p <0.001) in Royal Air Force recruits. Among Army recruits 62.7% were from the two most deprived quintiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation compared to 42.5% of Royal Naval recruits and 36.6% of Royal Air Force recruits. CONCLUSION: A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn."]}
{"question": "Is laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux surgery feasible?", "retrieved_passages": ["HYPOTHESIS: Laparoscopic techniques can be used to treat patients whose antireflux surgery has failed. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Two academic medical centers. PATIENTS: Forty-six consecutive patients, of whom 21 were male and 25 were female (mean age, 55.6 years; range, 15-80 years). Previous antireflux procedures were laparoscopic (21 patients), laparotomy (21 patients), thoracotomy (3 patients), and thoracoscopy (1 patient). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The cause of failure, operative and postoperative morbidity, and the level of follow-up satisfaction were determined for all patients. RESULTS: The causes of failure were hiatal herniation (31 patients [67%]), fundoplication breakdown (20 patients [43%]), fundoplication slippage (9 patients [20%]), tight fundoplication (5 patients [11%]), misdiagnosed achalasia (2 patients [4%]), and displaced Angelchik prosthesis (2 patients [4%]). Twenty-two patients (48%) had more than 1 cause. Laparoscopic reoperative procedures were Nissen fundoplication (n = 22), Toupet fundoplication (n = 13), paraesophageal hernia repair (n = 4), Dor procedure (n = 2), Angelchik prosthesis removal (n = 2), Heller myotomy (n = 2), and the takedown of a wrap (n = 1). In addition, 18 patients required crural repair and 13 required paraesophageal hernia repair. The mean +/- SEM duration of surgery was 3.5+/-1.1 hours. Operative complications were fundus tear (n = 8), significant bleeding (n = 4), bougie perforation (n = 1), small bowel enterotomy (n = 1), and tension pneumothorax (n = 1). The conversion rate (from laparoscopic to an open procedure) was 20% overall (9 patients) but 0% in the last 10 patients. Mortality was 0%. The mean +/- SEM hospital stay was 2.3+/-0.9 days for operations completed laparoscopically. Follow-up was possible in 35 patients (76%) at 17.2+/-11.8 months. The well-being score (1 best; 10, worst) was 8.6+/-2.1 before and 2.9+/-2.4 after surgery (P<.001). Thirty-one (89%) of 35 patients were satisfied with their decision to have reoperation. CONCLUSIONS: Antireflux surgery failures are most commonly associated with hiatal herniation, followed by the breakdown of the fundoplication. The laparoscopic approach may be used successfully to treat patients with failed antireflux operations. Good results were achieved despite the technical difficulty of the procedures.", "BACKGROUND: The aim was to determine the feasibility of laparoscopic revision surgery following previous open and laparoscopic antireflux operations. METHODS: The outcome was determined for 27 patients (14 men, 13 women) who had undergone attempted laparoscopic revision between 3 months and 25 years after a previous antireflux operation. Median follow-up was 12 (range 3-48) months. RESULTS: Thirteen patients had previously had an open antireflux procedure (Nissen fundoplication, seven; transthoracic anatomical repair, five; Belsey procedure, one) and 14 a laparoscopic procedure (Nissen, 12; anterior partial fundoplication, two). The indications for revision were: recurrent reflux, 15; paraoesophageal hiatus hernia, six; troublesome dysphagia, six. Fifteen procedures comprised construction of a new Nissen fundoplication, six conversion from a Nissen to a partial wrap, three repair of a paraoesophageal hernia and three widening of the oesophageal hiatus. Revision was successfully completed laparoscopically in 12 patients following a previous laparoscopic procedure and in nine following a previous open operation. Median operating time was 105 min after previous open surgery and 80 min after laparoscopic surgery. No perioperative complications occurred in either group and a good outcome was achieved in 25 of the 27 patients. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic reoperative antireflux surgery is feasible. Reoperation is likely to be more difficult following failure of an open procedure than a laparoscopic one.", "BACKGROUND: Antireflux operations for gastroesophageal reflux disease whether performed open or laparoscopically can fail and may require reoperation to control new, recurrent symptoms or operation-related complications. We report our experience with the laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux procedures. METHODS: Between 1995 and 2000, 37 patients underwent laparoscopic reoperative antireflux procedures. The mean age and weight were 52 years and 181.5 pounds. The main presenting symptoms were heartburn (n = 18), respiratory reflux (n = 4), chest pain (n = 3), regurgitation (n = 1), and dysphagia (n = 10). The mean duration between the first operation and recurrence of symptoms was 18 months, and the duration between the two procedures was 25 months. The operation was completed laparoscopically in 32 patients (86.5%): Nissen fundoplication (n = 27) and Toupet fundoplication (n = 9). RESULTS: Intraoperative and postoperative complications occurred in 6 and 14 patients, respectively. Fundoplication disruption was the most common cause of primary surgery failure. The mean hospital stay was 4 days. At a mean follow-up of 26.5 months, results were excellent to good (65%), fair (21.5%), and poor (13.5%). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic reoperative antireflux procedures are technically feasible with acceptable preliminary results.", "INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease has been established as being safe, effective, and the best alternative to continuous life-long medical therapy. Antireflux surgery is not, however, devoid of complications and failures. Treatment of these patients represents a major challenge, especially when reoperation is indicated. PATIENTS: One-hundred consecutive patients had a reoperation in our clinic. Previous antireflux procedures were laparoscopic (52 patients), laparotomy (39 patients), and thoracotomy (9 patients). RESULTS: Peri- or postoperative complications occurred in 30 patients (30%). Operative complications were stomach perforation (14), significant bleeding (6), esophageal mucosal perforation (4), gastrocutaneous fistula (2), small bowel enterotomy followed by fistula (1), and tension pneumothorax (1). Reoperation was required in only 2 patients because of a missed stomach perforation or persistent chest leak. The conversion rate (from laparoscopic to open procedure) was 17% overall. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic reoperation after a failed antireflux procedure is a major surgical challenge, and it is not devoid of morbidity. The surgeon must have extensive experience in laparoscopic surgery and should be able to perform reoperative open surgery through the abdomen and chest. Laparoscopic redo surgery is feasible with good results. Many patients in whom previous open surgery has failed enjoy the advantages of a laparoscopic redo procedure.", "Nineteen patients underwent laparoscopic reoperations for failed or complicated antireflux operations from a total of 248 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease who had been operated on by this approach. Sixteen had been submitted to open surgery and three to laparoscopic surgery over a period ranging from 5 days to 31 years before the study. Three patients had been submitted to two open antireflux surgeries previously. Seventeen patients had recurrent reflux esophagitis after different types of surgeries, and two patients presented with gastric strangulation after fundoplication. The causes of recurrence were: slipped total fundoplications (3), disruption of total and partial fundoplications (6), too-tight total fundoplication (1), too-low (gastric) partial fundoplication (1), Allison procedure (1), partial fundoplication and paraesophageal hernia (2), and unknown (3). The laparoscopic approach was used in 18 patients and a laparoscopic-thoracoscopic approach in 1. The procedures included laparoscopic total fundoplications (11), partial fundoplications (4), transhiatal esophagectomy (1), Collis-Nissen (1), Roux-en-Y gastrectomy and thoracoscopic vagotomy (1), and intrathoracic fundoplication (1). One patient was converted to open surgery. Intraoperative complications included 1 pneumothorax, 1 gastric perforation, and 1 esophageal perforation during the introduction of a Maloney dilator. Mean operative time was 210 min, ranging from 140 to 320 min. Mean hospital stay was 3.1 days after treatment of failed operations and 22 days after treatment of complications. Postoperative complications included subcutaneous infection (1), gastric fistula (1), and liver hematoma (1). The results have been excellent and good in 84.3% of the patients after a mean follow-up of 13 months. We concluded that laparoscopic reoperations are technically feasible with good preliminary results provided that the mandatory expertise is available."]}
{"question": "Is endometrial polyp formation associated with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta1?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Endometrial polyp is a common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding, but the etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is angiogenic, related to thick walled vessels and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is related to fibrotic tissue, which are characteristics of endometrial polyps. The primary objective of this study was to find out if endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of VEGF or TGF-beta1, or both. A secondary objective is to determine if the changes are related to steroid receptor expression. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective study compared VEGF and TGF-beta1 expression of endometrial polyps and adjacent endometrial tissue in 70 premenopausal women. The comparison of results was separately made for endometrium specimens obtained in the proliferative and secretory phases. The results were correlated with the steroid receptors (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) expression. RESULTS: The score of VEGF in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P<0.001) and the secretory phase (P=0.03); the score of VEGF in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium only in proliferative phase (P=0.006). The score of TGF-beta1 in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium in proliferative phase (P=0.02); whereas the score of TGF-beta1 in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P=0.006) and the secretory phase (P=0.008). There was a significant correlation between the expression of steroid receptors and VEGF and TGF-beta1 (Spearman's correlation P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There was increased expression of TGF-beta1 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-beta1 expression."]}
{"question": "Does radiotherapy around the time of pregnancy for Hodgkin's disease modify the risk of breast cancer?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To determine whether the risk of secondary breast cancer after radiotherapy (RT) for Hodgkin's disease is greater among women who underwent RT around time of pregnancy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 382 women treated with RT for Hodgkin's disease were reviewed and divided into those who received RT around the time of pregnancy and those who were not pregnant. Comparisons of the overall incidence, actuarial rates, and latency to breast cancer between the two groups were made. Multivariate Cox regression modeling was performed to determine possible contributing factors. RESULTS: Of the 382 women, 14 developed breast cancer (3.7%). The increase in the overall incidence (16.0% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.0001) and the actuarial rate of breast cancer among the women in the pregnant group (p = 0.011) was statistically significant. The women treated around the time of pregnancy had a 10- and 15-year actuarial rate of breast cancer of 6.7% and 32.6%, respectively. The 10-year and 15-year actuarial rate for the nonpregnant women was 0.4% and 1.7%, respectively. The median latency from RT to the diagnosis of breast cancer was 13.1 and 18.9 years for women in the pregnant and nonpregnant groups, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, pregnancy around the time of RT was the only variable associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The risk was dependent on the length of time from pregnancy to RT, with women receiving RT during pregnancy and within 1 month of pregnancy having an increased risk of breast cancer compared with nonpregnant women and women irradiated later than 1 month after pregnancy (hazard ratio, 22.49; 95% confidence interval, 5.56-90.88; p <0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that the risk of breast cancer after RT is greater with irradiation around the time of pregnancy. This suggests that pregnancy is a time of increased sensitivity of breast tissue to the carcinogenic effects of radiation. Because of the small sample size and limited follow-up, additional studies are recommended to confirm these findings."]}
{"question": "Should displaced midshaft clavicular fractures be treated surgically?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: A clavicular fracture accounts for 2.6%-5% of adult fractures. Fractures in the middle-third (OTA 15-B) represent 69%-82% of all clavicular fractures. There is no consensus among orthopedic surgeons regarding treatment for these fractures: many support conservative treatment even for displaced middle-third clavicular fractures, while others choose operative treatment. OBJECTIVES: To assess the attitudes of orthopedic surgeons regarding treatment of displaced mid-shaft clavicular fractures. METHODS: We conducted a survey in which we interviewed orthopedic surgeons from various countries during the 2012 EFORT meeting in Berlin. The questionnaire included an X-ray of a displaced middle-third clavicular fracture, as well as questions regarding the surgeon's proposed treatment plan. RESULTS: A total of 177 orthopedic surgeons completed the questionnaire; 49% preferred operative treatment for a displaced middle-third clavicular fracture. Among the orthopedic trauma specialists, 58% suggested operative treatment, as did 82% of shoulder specialists. Most surgeons preferred a locking plate for fixation. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment approach for a displaced middle-third clavicular fracture seems to be evenly split between conservative and operative approaches. The tendency toward operative treatment was.even more remarkable among orthopedic trauma specialists and shoulder specialists who completed the questionnaire. Most surgeons prefer a locking plate as a fixation system for this type of fracture.", "The most frequently treated injuries, representing approximately 82% of all clavicular fractures, involve the midshaft clavicle. Historically, most acute displaced midshaft clavicular fractures were treated nonsurgically. However, the outcomes of nonsurgical treatment have recently been thought to be not as good as expected in the past, and the trend is to treat these fractures surgically. The goal of this study was to evaluate the short-term clinical outcomes of Robinson type 2B2 clavicular fractures treated conservatively vs with locked plate fixation. Among 59 patients included in the study, 30 patients (mean age, 45+/-13.7 years; range, 30-62 years) treated conservatively were designated as group A, and 29 patients (mean age, 38.8+/-11.1 years; range, 20-60 years) treated with locked plate fixation were designated as group B. All patients were evaluated using Oxford and Constant scoring systems at final follow-up. Mean follow-up was 18 months (range, 12-24 months). In group A, mean Constant score was 70.5+/-15.1 (range, 98-43) and mean Oxford score was 46.6+/-1.3 (range, 49-44) at final follow-up. In group B, mean Constant score was 89.2+/-8 (range, 100-77) and mean Oxford score was 46.5+/-1.2 (range, 48-44) at final follow-up. Callus was detected radiographically in both groups at 6-week follow-up. Patients in groups A and B started active range-of-motion exercises at weeks 6 and 3 after treatment, respectively. Locked plate fixation of Robinson type 2B2 clavicular fractures can be the first treatment option because of good clinical results, low complication rates, and good cosmesis.", "INTRODUCTION: The optimal treatment of acute, displaced midshaft clavicle fractures is controversial. Despite lack of compelling evidence towards superior results after primary surgery, it seems that more and more patients are treated surgically. The aim of this study was to investigate which treatment modality should be preferred in this population according to current literature. METHOD: Randomized trials and prospective cohort studies comparing different treatment modalities for acute, displaced midshaft clavicle fracture in adults, published in English from 1966 to August 2011 were sought via an electronic database search (MEDLINE). RESULTS: Five studies with a total of 365 patients were identified. All fractures were described as midshaft fractures with complete displacement of their bony parts. Overall, the functional outcome (measured with the Constant score) was better in the surgically treated groups than in the conservatively treated groups. Likewise, union rates were higher in the surgical groups than in the conservative groups. Overall, complication rates were close to 30% in the surgically treated groups compared with 47% in the conservatively treated groups. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of acute, displaced midshaft clavicle fractures with a plate yields a better functional outcome and lower mal- and nonunion rates than conservative treatment. However, the clinical relevance of the observed functional benefits are questionable as is the use of the shoulder outcome scores frequently employed to assess the functional outcome of clavicle fracture treatment. When operative treatment is preferred, the number needed to treat to avoid a nonunion is high.", "Multiple meta-analyses have been performed to compare surgical and conservative interventions for treating displaced midshaft clavicular fractures. But conclusions are discordant.The purposes of current study were (1) to conduct a systematic review of meta-analyses comparing surgical and conservative interventions for the treatment of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures, (2) to help decision makers interpret and choose among discordant meta-analyses, and (3) to provide treatment recommendations through the best available evidence.We searched the Cochrane library, PubMed, and EMBASE databases to identify meta-analyses comparing surgical and conservative treatments for the displaced midshaft clavicular fractures. Two investigators independently scanned titles and abstracts to exclude irrelevant articles and identify meta-analyses that met the eligibility criteria. The methodological quality of the meta-analysis was independently assessed by the two investigators using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence and the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool. The Jadad decision algorithm was applied to determine which of the included studies provided the best available evidence.Six meta-analyses met the eligibility criteria in this systematic review. AMSTAR scores ranged from 5 to 10. The Jadad decision-making tool suggests that the highest quality review should be selected based on the publication characteristics of the primary trials, the methodology of the primary trials, the language restrictions, and whether analysis of data on individual patients was included in the study. As a result, we selected a high-quality Cochrane review.This systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses comparing surgical and conservative treatments suggests that surgical treatment provides a lower rate of overall treatment failure and a better functional outcome, but is associated with more implant-related complications. Hence, treatment should be individualized, with careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of each treatment method and of patient preferences.", "OBJECTIVES: It is unclear whether all completely displaced midshaft clavicle fractures require primary surgical intervention. The aim of this study was to elucidate the radiological and clinical outcomes after conservative treatment, and to identify subgroups at risk of an inferior outcome. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Level II trauma center. PATIENTS: Between 2005 and 2008, 122 patients were conservatively treated for a completely displaced midshaft clavicle fracture of whom 92 were eligible for inclusion in this study. Of these, 59 completed the study after a median of 2.7 years after the fracture (min-max, 1.1-4.9). INTERVENTION: The patients received the standard treatment administered at our institution at the time: nonsurgically with a sling without physiotherapy. Patients with painful nonunions were subsequently offered surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: At follow-up, the patients' Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) and the Constant scores were evaluated. Radiographs were taken at follow-up and compared to those taken acutely. RESULTS: Nonunion was found in 9 of the 59 (15.3%) patients. Twenty-four (24%) patients reported a fair-to-poor DASH score (i.e. >20). Patients with fractures that were vertically displaced by more than 100% (one bone width) were significantly less satisfied than those with fractures vertically displaced at 100% (p = 0.04). Initial shortening of more than 15 mm was not associated with a worse outcome or nonunion. The odds ratio of developing a nonunion increased with age (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: By treating completely displaced midshaft clavicle fractures conservatively with a sling and offering plate fixation for eventual painful nonunions, we found a 24% risk of a fair or poor clinical result with a DASH score over 20. A vertical displacement of more than 100 % between the main fragments on the initial radiograph was associated with an inferior clinical outcome in this study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV."]}
{"question": "Is etoricoxib effective in preventing heterotopic ossification after primary total hip arthroplasty?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Heterotopic ossification is a common complication after total hip arthroplasty. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to prevent heterotopic ossifications effectively, however gastrointestinal complaints are reported frequently. In this study, we investigated whether etoricoxib, a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor that produces fewer gastrointestinal side effects, is an effective alternative for the prevention of heterotopic ossification. METHODS: We investigated the effectiveness of oral etoricoxib 90 mg for seven days in a prospective two-stage study design for phase-2 clinical trials in a small sample of patients (n = 42). A cemented primary total hip arthroplasty was implanted for osteoarthritis. Six months after surgery, heterotopic ossification was determined on anteroposterior pelvic radiographs using the Brooker classification. RESULTS: No heterotopic ossification was found in 62 % of the patients that took etoricoxib; 31 % of the patients had Brooker grade 1 and 7 % Brooker grade 2 ossification. CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib seems effective in preventing heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty. This finding further supports the use of COX-2 inhibitors for the prevention of heterotopic ossification following total hip arthroplasty.", "BACKGROUND: Heterotopic ossifications are a common complication after total hip arthroplasty. Low-dose radiation therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have proven to effectively reduce the rate of heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty. However, a low number of studies describe an equal efficiency of etoricoxib. This work shows first results on the examination of a larger group with 194 subjects to analyze efficiency and rate of side effects under treatment with etoricoxib. METHODS: Clinical examinations were performed the day before surgery and after at least 12 months. The survey of clinical and functional outcome was done with Harris Hip Score (HHS). Conventional antero-posterior radiographs and second plane in frog leg position were assessed. RESULTS: In total, 14 undesirable side effects (7.4%) and only four early terminations of therapy (2.1%) were documented. A complete 1-year follow-up examination including radiographs could be done in 143 subjects (79.4%). Only 28 subjects (19.6%) developed heterotopic ossifications from which 92.9% were classified in type 1 and 7.1% in type 2 using the method described by Brooker. The results do not show correlations with body mass index, extended treatment (more than ten days), or clinical and functional outcome (measured by \"Harris Hip Score\"). However, male subjects show a significantly higher rate of heterotopic ossifications. CONCLUSIONS: The investigations presented in this study confirm a good efficiency of etoricoxib for the prevention of heterotopic ossifications in comparison with classical methods such as radiation or drug therapy and show a low rate of undesirable side effects.", "PURPOSE: This study investigated whether etoricoxib (COX-II blocker) has a superior efficacy of preventing heterotopic ossification (HO) after total hip arthroplasty (THA) compared to diclofenac (non-selective NSAID). METHODS: One hundred patients were included (50 in each group) in this single centre, prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial. Etoricoxib (90 mg) was administered once and diclofenac (75 mg) twice per day for a perioperative period of nine days. The incidence of HO was evaluated on radiographs of the pelvis six months after surgery. RESULTS: Eighty nine of 100 (89 %) patients could be analysed. The overall HO incidence was 37.8 %. There was no significant difference between both study groups. Twelve patients (27.3 %) of the DIC group and 13 patients (28.9 %) of the ETO group showed Brooker grade I ossifications. Five patients (11.4 %) of the DIC and four patients of the ETO (8.9 %) group showed grade II HO formations. No class III or IV HO formations occured in both groups. Ad hoc analysis detected a negative correlation between HO incidence and limited abduction and internal rotation of the hip. CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib and diclofenac are equally effective for oral HO prophylaxis after primary cementless THA when given for nine peri-operative days to ensure a full recovery and high patient satisfaction."]}
{"question": "Should serum pancreatic lipase replace serum amylase as a biomarker of acute pancreatitis?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Serum pancreatic lipase may improve the diagnosis of pancreatitis compared to serum amylase. Both enzymes have been measured simultaneously at our hospital allowing for a comparison of their diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: Seventeen thousand five hundred and thirty-one measurements of either serum amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase were made on 10 931 patients treated at a metropolitan teaching hospital between January 2001 and May 2003. Of these, 8937 were initially treated in the Emergency Department. These results were collected in a database, which was linked by the patients' medical record number to the radiology and medical records. Patients with either an elevated lipase value or a discharge diagnosis of acute pancreatitis had their radiological diagnosis reviewed along with their biochemistry and histology record. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made if there was radiological evidence of peripancreatic inflammation. RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and twenty-five patients had either elevated serum amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase. The medical records coded for pancreatitis in a further 55 whose enzymes were not elevated. Three hundred and twenty of these had radiological evidence of acute pancreatitis. Receiver operator characteristic analysis of the initial sample from patients received in the Emergency Department showed improved diagnostic accuracy for serum pancreatic lipase (area under the curve (AUC) 0.948) compared with serum amylase (AUC, 0.906, P < 0.05). A clinically useful cut-off point would be at the diagnostic threshold; 208 U/L (normal <190 U/L) for serum pancreatic lipase and 114 U/L (normal 27-100 U/L) for serum amylase where the sensitivity was 90.3 cf., 76.8% and the specificity was 93 cf., 92.6%. 18.8% of the acute pancreatitis patients did not have elevated serum amylase while only 2.9% did not have elevated serum pancreatic lipase on the first emergency department measurement. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "Serum lipase is a biochemical marker used for diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Lipase has largely replaced amylase in terms of diagnostic value, although both markers are still commonly used. In this publication, we discuss the diagnostic superiority of lipase compared to amylase in acute pancreatitis. Two cases are discussed; both patients presented with elevated lipase values but due to different causes. The first patient, who had recently experienced cholecystitis, presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain and high lipase levels. The second patient, who had received a renal transplant a few years earlier, visited the gastroenterological outpatient clinic with abdominal pain and only a slightly elevated lipase level.", "Obesity is associated with increased severity of acute pancreatitis (AP). The cytokines IL-18 and IL-12 are elevated in patients with AP, and IL-18 levels are high in obesity. We aimed to develop a pathologically relevant model to study obesity-associated severe AP. Lean WT and obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice received two injections of IL-12 plus IL-18. Survival, pancreatic inflammation, and biochemical markers of AP were measured. Dosing with IL-12 plus IL-18 induced 100% lethality in ob/ob mice; no lethality was observed in WT mice. Disruption of pancreatic exocrine tissue and acinar cell death as well as serum amylase and lipase levels were significantly higher in ob/ob than in WT mice. Edematous AP developed in WT mice, whereas obese ob/ob mice developed necrotizing AP. Adipose tissue necrosis and saponification were present in cytokine-injected ob/ob but not in WT mice. Severe hypocalcemia and elevated acute-phase response developed in ob/ob mice. The cytokine combination induced high levels of regenerating protein 1 and pancreatitis-associated protein expression in the pancreas of WT but not of ob/ob mice. To differentiate the contribution of obesity to that of leptin deficiency, mice received short- and long-term leptin replacement therapy. Short-term leptin reconstitution in the absence of major weight loss did not protect ob/ob mice, whereas leptin deficiency in the absence of obesity resulted in a significant reduction in the severity of the pancreatitis. In conclusion, we developed a pathologically relevant model of AP in which obesity per se is associated with increased severity.", "1. The time course of iron overload of the pancreas in hypotransferrinaemic mice maintained on a standard rodent diet was compared with biochemical and histological markers of tissue damage. 2. Pancreatic iron levels increased linearly from weaning till 9 months of age [73.3 nmol/mg of tissue (SEM 9.9; n = 5) compared with 0.9 nmol/mg of tissue (SEM 0.1; n = 4) in age-matched controls] then decreased linearly till at least 18 months of age. 3. Investigation of tissue distribution of newly absorbed radioiron suggested that significant redistribution of iron from liver to pancreas (rather than direct dietary iron sources) must be invoked to explain the rate of pancreatic iron loading in hypotransferrinaemic mice. 4. Pancreatic epithelial cells first showed altered morphology at 9 months of age. At 12 months of age, the pancreatic epithelium had developed a micronodular appearance, with large numbers of acini replaced by atrophic, degenerated acinar cells. Increased collagen fibre deposition was evident by trichrome staining and by electron microscopy. Biochemical markers of pancreatitis (serum lipase, tissue pancreatitis-associated protein mRNA) were elevated before 9 months of age, whereas the levels of pancreatic amylase mRNA declined from 9 months of age. 5. The data suggest that iron loading of hypotransferrinaemic mouse pancreas proceeds up to a threshold level at 9 months of age followed by a progressive atrophy of secretory epithelium. The hypotransferrinaemic mouse pancreas is a useful model system for investigation of parenchymal cell damage by iron."]}
{"question": "Does bone anchor fixation improve the outcome of percutaneous bladder neck suspension in female stress urinary incontinence?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of a new modification of percutaneous needle suspension, using a bone anchor system for fixing the suture at the public bone, and to compare the results with those published previously. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 1996, 37 patients with stress urinary incontinence (> 2 years) were treated using a bone anchor system. On each side the suture was attached to the pubocervical fascia and the vaginal wall via a broad 'Z'-stitch. A urodynamic investigation performed preoperatively in all patients confirmed stress incontinence and excluded detrusor instability. The outcome was assessed by either by a clinical follow-up investigation or using a standardized questionnaire, over a mean follow-up of 11 months (range 6-18). RESULTS: In the 37 patients, the procedure was successful in 25 (68%), with 16 (43%) of the patients completely dry and nine (24%) significantly improved. Removal of the bone anchor and suture was necessary in two patients, because of unilateral bacterial infection in one and a bilateral soft tissue granuloma in the other. One bone anchor became dislocated in a third patient. In two cases where the treatment failed, new detrusor instability was documented urodynamically. Minor complications were prolonged wound pain in 10 (26%) and transient urinary retention or residual urine in 12 patients (32%). CONCLUSION: The poor success rate in the study corresponds with the long-term results of conventional or modified needle suspension procedures and does not reinforce the optimistic results of bone anchoring published recently. Because of the poorer long-term results from percutaneous needle suspension than from other techniques of open retropubic bladder neck suspension, it remains questionable whether percutaneous needle suspension should be considered a first-line procedure for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence."]}
{"question": "Are intraoperative precursor events associated with postoperative major adverse events?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: Precursor events are undesirable events that can lead to a subsequent adverse event and have been associated with postoperative mortality. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether precursor events are associated with a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, acute renal failure, stroke, infection) in a low- to medium-risk coronary artery bypass grafting, valve, and valve plus coronary artery bypass grafting population. These events might be targets for strategies aimed at quality improvement. METHODS: The present study was a retrospective cohort design performed at the Queen Elizabeth Health Science Centre. Low- to medium-risk patients who had experienced postoperative MACE were matched 1:1 with patients who had not experienced postoperative MACE. The operative notes, for both groups, were scored by 5 surgeons to determine the frequency of 4 precursor events: bleeding, difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, repair or regrafting, and incomplete revascularization or repair. A univariate comparison of >/=1 precursor events in the matched groups was performed. RESULTS: A total of 311 MACE patients (98.4%) were matched. The primary outcome occurred more frequently in the MACE group than in the non-MACE group (33% vs 24%; P = .015). The incidence of the individual events of bleeding and difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass was significantly higher in the MACE group. Those patients with a precursor event in the absence of MACE also appeared to have a greater prevalence of other important postoperative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery who are exposed to intraoperative precursor events were more likely to experience a postoperative MACE. Quality improvement techniques aimed at mitigating the consequences of precursor events might improve the surgical outcomes for cardiac surgical patients.", "OBJECTIVE: Increasing attention has been afforded to the ubiquity of medical error and associated adverse events in medicine. There remains little data on the frequency and nature of precursor events in cardiac surgery, and we sought to characterize this. METHODS: Detailed, anonymous information regarding intraoperative precursor events (which may result in adverse events) was collected prospectively from six key members of the operating team during 464 major adult cardiac surgical cases at three hospitals and were analyzed with univariable statistical methods. RESULTS: During 464 cardiac surgical procedures, 1627 reports of problematic precursor events were collected for an average of 3.5 and maximum of 26 per procedure. 73.3% of cases had at least one recorded event. One-third (33.3%) of events occurred prior to the first incision, and 31.2% of events occurred while on bypass. While 68.0% of events were regarded as minor in severity (e.g., delays and missing equipment), a substantial proportion (32.0%) was considered major and included anastomotic problems, pump failure, and drug errors. Most problems (90.4%) were reported as being compensated for, although many (30.9%) were never discussed among the team. Major events were more likely to be discussed (p<0.0001) and less likely to have been previously encountered (p=0.0005). Perceptions of the severity and compensation of events varied across the team, as did temporal patterns of reporting (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of problematic precursor events occurs during the majority of cardiac surgery procedures. Attention to causes and ways of preventing these precursor events could have an impact on the rate of significant errors and improve the safety of cardiac surgery.", "BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing vascular surgery are prone to perioperative organ injury because of both higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and the extent of surgery. Early detection of organ failure is essential to facilitate appropriate medical care. Midregional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) has been investigated in acute medical care settings to guide clinical decision-making regarding patient pathways and to identify patients prone to imminent cardiovascular or inflammatory complications. In this study, we evaluated the impact of perioperative MR-proADM levels as an early marker of perioperative cardiovascular and inflammatory stress reactions and kidney injury. METHODS: The study was conducted as a monocentric, prospective, noninterventional trial at Hannover Medical School, Germany. A total of 454 consecutive patients who underwent open vascular surgery were followed from the day prior to until 30 days after surgery. The composite primary end point was defined as the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), acute kidney injury (AKI), or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Measurements were correlated with both medical history and postoperative MACE, AKI, or SIRS using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-nine (31%) of the patients reached the primary end point within the study interval. Midregional pro-adrenomedullin change was associated with the combined primary end point and with the intensity of surgical trauma. Midregional pro-adrenomedullin change was increased in patients reaching the secondary end points, SIRS (optimal cutoff: 0.2 nmol/L) and AKI (optimal cutoff: 0.7 nmol/L), but not in patients with MACEs. CONCLUSION: Increased levels of MR-proADM within the perioperative setting (1) were linked to the invasiveness of surgery and (2) identified patients with ongoing loss of renal function. Increased MR-proADM levels may therefore identify a subgroup of patients prone to excessive cardiovascular stress but did not directly correlate with adverse cardiac events. Consistently low levels of MR-proADM may identify a subgroup of patients with acceptable low risk to guide discharge from high-density care units.", "INTRODUCTION: Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) following distal pancreatectomy (DP) remains the most frequent complication, potential precursor of more serious events, and mechanisms behind POPF development are not clear. Primary aim of the current study is to investigate correlations between patients' characteristics, including technical intraoperative data assessed by retrospective video review of laparoscopic DP (L-PD), and development of clinically relevant (CR-)POPF and major complication. METHODS: Patients undergoing L-DP whose surgery video was available for review were included in this study. Retrospective video review, performed by two surgeons blinded for postoperative outcomes, was focused on pancreatic neck transection and identification of pancreatic capsule disruption (PCD)/staple line bleeding (SLB). Correlation between clinical, demographic, and intraoperative factors and CR-POPF/major complications and assessment of factors associated with PCD and SLB were investigated. RESULTS: Of 41 L-DP performed at our institution (June 2015-June 2020) using a triple-row stapler (EndoGIA Reloads with Tri-Staple), surgery video was available for 38 patients [men/women, 13/25; median age (range) 62 (25-84) years; median BMI (range) 24 (17-42)]. PCD and SLB occurred in 15(39%) and 19(50%) patients and were concomitant in 9(24%). CR-POPF and major complications occurred in 8(21%) and 12(31%) patients, respectively. PCD, SLB, and PCD + SLB rates were significantly higher among patients with CR-POPF, compared to patients without (all p < 0.05). Among patients with PCD, pancreatic thickness at pancreatic transection site was higher (19 mm), compared to non-PCD patients (13 mm, p < 0.001). A directly proportional relation between PCD, CR-POPF, and major complication rate and pancreatic thickness was confirmed by ROC analysis (AUC = 0.949, 0.798, and 0.740, respectively). CONCLUSION: PCD and SLB close to the staple line detected by retrospective video-review are intraoperatively detectable indicators of severe pancreatic traumatism and a potential precursors of CR-POPF following L-PD. Given the strict correlation between PCD and pancreatic thickness, alternative techniques to stapled closure for pancreatic transection may be recommended for patients with a thick pancreas and modification in postoperative care may be considered in patients with PCD/SLB.", "BACKGROUND: Perioperative fluid strategies influence clinical outcomes following major surgery. Many intravenous fluid preparations are based on simple solutions, such as normal saline, that feature an electrolyte composition that differs from that of physiological plasma. Buffered fluids have a theoretical advantage of containing a substrate that acts to maintain the body's acid-base status - typically a bicarbonate or a bicarbonate precursor such as maleate, gluconate, lactate, or acetate. Buffered fluids also provide additional electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and calcium, more closely matching the electrolyte balance of plasma. The putative benefits of buffered fluids have been compared with those of non-buffered fluids in the context of clinical studies conducted during the perioperative period. This review was published in 2012, and was updated in 2017. OBJECTIVES: To review effects of perioperative intravenous administration of buffered versus non-buffered fluids for plasma volume expansion or maintenance, or both, on clinical outcomes in adults undergoing all types of surgery. SEARCH METHODS: We electronically searched the Clinicaltrials.gov major trials registry, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to June 2016), Embase (1980 to June 2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to June 2016). We handsearched conference abstracts and, when possible, contacted leaders in the field. We reran the search in May 2017. We added one potential new study of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate this trial into formal review findings when we prepare the review update. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only randomized controlled trials that compared buffered versus non-buffered intravenous fluids for surgical patients were eligible for inclusion. We excluded other forms of comparison such as crystalloids versus colloids and colloids versus different colloids. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We resolved disagreements by discussion and consensus, in collaboration with a third review author. We contacted trial authors to request additional information when appropriate. We presented pooled estimates for dichotomous outcomes as odds ratios (ORs) and for continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed data via Review Manager 5.3 using fixed-effect models, and when heterogeneity was high (I(2) > 40%), we used random-effects models. MAIN RESULTS: This review includes, in total, 19 publications of 18 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1096 participants. We incorporated five of those 19 studies (330 participants) after the June 2016 update. Outcome measures in the included studies were thematically similar, covering perioperative electrolyte status, renal function, and acid-base status; however, we found significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity among the included studies. We identified variable protocols for fluid administration and total volumes of fluid administered to patients intraoperatively. Trial authors variably reported outcome data at disparate time points and with heterogeneous patient groups. Consequently, many outcome measures are reported in small group sizes, reducing overall confidence in effect size, despite relatively low inherent bias in the included studies. Several studies reported orphan outcome measures. We did not include in the results of this review one large, ongoing study of saline versus Ringer's solution.We found insufficient evidence on effects of fluid therapies on mortality and postoperative organ dysfunction (defined as renal insufficiency leading to renal replacement therapy); confidence intervals were wide and included both clinically relevant benefit and harm: mortality (Peto OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.37 to 9.33; I(2) = 0%; 3 trials, 6 deaths, 276 participants; low-quality evidence); renal insufficiency (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.98; I(2) = 0%; 4 trials, 22 events, 276 participants; low-quality evidence).We noted several metabolic differences, including a difference in postoperative pH measured at end of surgery of 0.05 units - lower in the non-buffered fluid group (12 studies with a total of 720 participants; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.07; I(2) = 61%). However, this difference was not maintained on postoperative day one. We rated the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate. We observed a higher postoperative serum chloride level immediately after operation, with use of non-buffered fluids reported in 10 studies with a total of 530 participants (MD 6.77 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.38 to 10.17), and this difference persisted until day one postoperatively (five studies with a total of 258 participants; MD 8.48 mmol/L, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.88). We rated the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is insufficient to show effects of perioperative administration of buffered versus non-buffered crystalloid fluids on mortality and organ system function in adult patients following surgery. Benefits of buffered fluid were measurable in biochemical terms, particularly a significant reduction in postoperative hyperchloraemia and metabolic acidosis. Small effect sizes for biochemical outcomes and lack of correlated clinical follow-up data mean that robust conclusions on major morbidity and mortality associated with buffered versus non-buffered perioperative fluid choices are still lacking. Larger studies are needed to assess these relevant clinical outcomes."]}
{"question": "HIF1A as a major vascular endothelial growth factor regulator: do its polymorphisms have an association with age-related macular degeneration?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the polymorphisms of HIF1A, a major vascular epithelial growth factor regulator under hypoxic conditions. The associations of AMD and polymorphisms of genes CFH, SKIV2L and MYRIP were also studied. DESIGN: Prospective study. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven AMD patients and 80 healthy subjects admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology at Pamukkale University Hospital, Denizli, Turkey, were included: 45 (52%) had wet type AMD, and 42 (48%) had dry type AMD. METHODS: Polymorphisms rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and rs11549467 (HIF1A) were investigated in DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples of the cases and controls by dye-termination DNA sequencing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genotype distribution of rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and rs11549467 (HIF1A) in AMD cases and healthy controls; association between genotypes and AMD subtypes. RESULTS: Given the significant difference between the mean age of case and control groups (72.13 +/- 5.77 vs. 62.80 +/- 5.22, respectively) (P = .000), subsequent analyses were adjusted for age. We found that having at least one C allele for polymorphism rs1061170 increases AMD risk independent of age (OR = 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-4.81). The ancestral T allele for polymorphism rs1061170 has a protective effect for AMD (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.34-0.83). No statistically significant difference for distributions of other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) emerged between patients and healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: No associations appeared between HIF1A SNPs and AMD, which were studied here for the first time; however, polymorphism rs1061170 of the CFH gene is associated with AMD in our population.", "PURPOSE: The use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy, with drugs such as ranibizumab and bevacizumab, to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) produces an effective but widely variable response. Identifying markers that predict differentiated response could serve as a valuable assay in developing more personalized medicine. This study aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence the outcome of treatment with anti-VEGF therapy for AMD. METHODS: One hundred six patients with nAMD were treated with either ranibizumab or bevacizumab as needed over a period of 12 months. Visual acuity and the presence of macular fluid were measured with optical coherence tomography at baseline, six months, and 12 months. Patients were then classified as good or poor responders based on change in visual acuity and macular fluid on follow-up visits. DNA extracted from blood was genotyped with a TaqMan-based allelic discrimination SNP assay for 21 SNPs in six candidate genes (PLAG12A, IL23R, STAT3, VEGFA, KDR, and HIF1A). The SNPs were primarily selected based on previously reported associations with AMD and functional involvement in angiogenesis pathways. SNPs shown to be promising for association with anti-VEGF therapy were then assessed in an independent AMD case-control cohort. RESULTS: Of the 106 patients with nAMD, 77 were classified as good responders and 29 as poor responders. For rs2285714 (PLA2G12A), the frequency of minor allele T was 40.1% for good responders compared to 51.7% for poor responders (odds ratio: 1.60, 95% confidence interval of odds ratio: 0.87-2.94, p=0.13). Genetic model analysis of rs2285714 (PLA2G12A) demonstrated an association between rs2285714 (PLA2G12A) and therapy response in a dominant genotypic model. Patients carrying at least one T allele of rs2285714 were 2.79 times (95% confidence interval=1.02-7.69, p<0.05) more likely to be poor responders (79.3% of poor responders) than good responders (57.3% of good responders). However, after adjusting for multiple testing by the false discovery rate or Bonferroni correction, the initially observed association was no longer statistically significant. No association was identified between the remaining SNPs and response status. The SNP rs2285714 of PLA2G12A was not significantly associated with AMD in an independent AMD case-control cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest a possible weak association between rs2285714 (PLA2G12A) and response to anti-VEGF therapy, but the association must be confirmed in additional cohorts with larger patient samples. Identifying factors that predict the differentiated response could provide a valuable assay for developing approaches in personalized medicine."]}
{"question": "Is combined therapy more effective than growth hormone or hyperbaric oxygen alone in the healing of left ischemic and non-ischemic colonic anastomoses?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the effects of growth hormone (GH), hyperbaric oxygen and combined therapy on normal and ischemic colonic anastomoses in rats. METHODS: Eighty male Wistar rats were divided into eight groups (n = 10). In the first four groups, non-ischemic colonic anastomosis was performed, whereas in the remaining four groups, ischemic colonic anastomosis was performed. In groups 5, 6, 7, and 8, colonic ischemia was established by ligating 2 cm of the mesocolon on either side of the anastomosis. The control groups (1 and 5) received no treatment. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was initiated immediately after surgery and continued for 4 days in groups 3 and 4. Groups 2 and 6 received recombinant human growth hormone, whereas groups 4 and 8 received GH and hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Relaparotomy was performed on postoperative day 4, and a perianastomotic colon segment 2 cm in length was excised for the detection of biochemical and mechanical parameters of anastomotic healing and histopathological evaluation. RESULTS: Combined treatment with hyperbaric oxygen and GH increased the mean bursting pressure values in all of the groups, and a statistically significant increase was noted in the ischemic groups compared to the controls (p<0.05). This improvement was more evident in the ischemic and normal groups treated with combined therapy. In addition, a histopathological evaluation of anastomotic neovascularization and collagen deposition showed significant differences among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with recombinant human growth hormone and hyperbaric oxygen resulted in a favorable therapeutic effect on the healing of ischemic colonic anastomoses.", "AIMS: Although preliminary studies have demonstrated safety and effectiveness of single replacement therapy for growth hormone deficiency or testosterone deficiency in heart failure (HF), no data are available regarding the combined treatment with both GH and T in this setting. Thus, the aim of the present hypothesis generating pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of multiple hormonal replacement therapies in chronic HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five stable HF with reduced ejection fraction patients, with a concomitant diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency and testosterone deficiency, on top of guideline-based HF treatment underwent 1 year of GH replacement therapy by subcutaneous injections of somatotropin at a dose of 0.012 mg/kg every second day. After 12 months, a T replacement treatment was added at a dosage of 1000 mg every 3 months. Each patient underwent a complete M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic examination, and an incremental symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test on a bicycle ergometer at baseline (BL), after 1 year of GH treatment (V1), and after 1 year of combined GH + T treatments (V2). One-year of GH treatment resulted in a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (+5.4%, P < 0.01), New York Heart Association functional class (P < 0.05), and peak oxygen consumption (VO(2) peak) (+19.3%, P < 0.01), and in a significant reduction in NT-proBNP levels (-35.1%, P < 0.01). Notably, one additional year of combined GH and T replacement therapy induced a further increase in VO(2) peak (+27.7%, final delta change + 52.44%, P < 0.01), as well as a significant improvement in muscular strength, as assessed by handgrip dynamometry (+17.5%, final delta change + 25.8%, P < 0.01). These beneficial effects were paralleled with an improvement of the overall clinical status (as assessed by New York Heart Association class). Of note, neither adverse effects nor cardiovascular events were reported during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data suggest for the first time that combined replacement therapy with GH and T could be considered safe and therapeutic in HF patients with multiple hormone deficiencies, supporting the hypothesis that multiple hormone deficiencies syndrome can be considered as a novel and promising therapeutic target in HF. Further studies with a more robust design and larger population are needed.", "Radiotherapy (RT), particularly when combined with chemotherapy, has progressively become the nonsurgical standard of care in the primary treatment of a variety of cancers. Likewise, hormonal therapy is routinely combined with RT for the treatment of hormone-sensitive tumors. In addition, the clinical efficacy of combining an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist with RT was recently validated. In view of cancer heterogeneity and the availability of an increasing number of therapy options, identification of biomarkers that can predict tumor response to a given therapy is crucial in streamlining treatment and sparing patients from receiving often toxic and expensive therapies that are not likely to be effective. Well-established biomarkers for response to hormonal therapy and/or RT are tumor estrogen receptor and the receptor tyrosine kinase HER-2 for breast cancer and serum prostate-specific antigen for prostate carcinoma. Some markers of tumor hypoxia and the level of tumor EGFR expression have been shown to be independent predictors of tumor response to RT. The use of biomarkers for predicting tumor response to the combination of RT and chemotherapy has thus far been limited to the methylation status of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in patients with glioblastoma multiforme treated with the combination of RT plus temozolomide. No validated biomarkers for predicting the response to molecular therapeutics are currently available. In this review, we call for standardization and simplification of assay methods and stress the importance of conducting confirmatory prospective studies. Integrated plans for identifying molecular markers built into many ongoing trials will hopefully generate more insights in the near future.", "INTRODUCTION: Acromegaly requires a multimodal treatment approach that includes surgery by an expert pituitary neurosurgeon, pharmacological treatment with one or more of the available drugs and radiation therapy. These treatment alternatives are not mutually exclusive but rather complement each other when properly indicated in the individual patient. In this review, we summarize and analyze the available data concerning the choice of the surgical approach (microscopy vs. endoscopy) and the interactions between medical treatment with somatostatin analogs and pituitary surgery. AREAS COVERED: Technical aspects, complications and outcome of transsphenoidal surgery (TSS); Advantages and disadvantages of the microscopic and endoscopic approaches; Safety and efficacy of somatostatin analogs (SSA); Primary pharmacological therapy versus primary TSS; Benefits of the preoperative treatment with SSA; and the effect of surgical tumor debulking in the therapeutic response to SSA. EXPERT COMMENTARY: Continuing efforts at improving surgical techniques and at generating more efficacious pharmacological therapies for acromegaly are likely to improve the outcome of these patients. However, an integral approach of the patient aimed not only at achieving biochemical criteria of cure but also at treating the individual comorbidities is mandatory to improve the quality of life of these patients and to reduce their mortality rate.", "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss treatments used to enhance growth in pediatric patients with short stature. RECENT FINDINGS: New data confirm the known efficacy of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and idiopathic short stature. The latest data from the Safety and Appropriateness of Growth hormone Treatment in Europe cohort did not indicate a long-term risk of malignancy in those treated for isolated GHD, but possibly increased risk in those with other diagnoses. Recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 is effective in treating patients with pregnancy-associated plasma protein A2 deficiency. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or aromatase inhibitor treatment to delay puberty remains controversial. They are more likely to augment adult height if combined with rhGH treatment in children already receiving rhGH. Preliminary data indicate that recombinant C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is safe in children and increases growth velocity upon 42 months of treatment in achondroplasia. SUMMARY: Recent data confirms previous data on rhGH efficacy and safety. Therapies to delay growth plate closure have greatest efficacy to augment height if combined with GH in select diagnoses. Recombinant CNP holds promise as a medical treatment for short stature associated with achondroplasia."]}

{"question": "Do \"America's Best Hospitals\" perform better for acute myocardial infarction?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: \"America's Best Hospitals,\" an influential list published annually by U.S. News and World Report, assesses the quality of hospitals. It is not known whether patients admitted to hospitals ranked at the top in cardiology have lower short-term mortality from acute myocardial infarction than those admitted to other hospitals or whether differences in mortality are explained by differential use of recommended therapies. METHODS: Using data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project on 149,177 elderly Medicare beneficiaries with acute myocardial infarction in 1994 or 1995, we examined the care and outcomes of patients admitted to three types of hospitals: those ranked high in cardiology (top-ranked hospitals); hospitals not in the top rank that had on-site facilities for cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty, and bypass surgery (similarly equipped hospitals); and the remaining hospitals (non-similarly equipped hospitals). We compared 30-day mortality; the rates of use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and reperfusion; and the relation of differences in rates of therapy to short-term mortality. RESULTS: Admission to a top-ranked hospital was associated with lower adjusted 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.00; P=0.05 for top-ranked hospitals vs. the others). Among patients without contraindications to therapy, top-ranked hospitals had significantly higher rates of use of aspirin (96.2 percent, as compared with 88.6 percent for similarly equipped hospitals and 83.4 percent for non-similarly equipped hospitals; P<0.01) and beta-blockers (75.0 percent vs. 61.8 percent and 58.7 percent, P<0.01), but lower rates of reperfusion therapy (61.0 percent vs. 70.7 percent and 65.6 percent, P=0.03). The survival advantage associated with admission to top-ranked hospitals was less strong after we adjusted for factors including the use of aspirin and beta-blockers (odds ratio, 0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.08; P=0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Admission to a hospital ranked high on the list of \"America's Best Hospitals\" was associated with lower 30-day mortality among elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction. A substantial portion of the survival advantage may be associated with these hospitals' higher rates of use of aspirin and beta-blocker therapy.", "BACKGROUND: The ranking of \"America's Best Hospitals\" by U.S. News & World Report for \"Heart and Heart Surgery\" is a popular hospital profiling system, but it is not known if hospitals ranked by the magazine vs nonranked hospitals have lower risk-standardized, 30-day mortality rates (RSMRs) for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: Using a hierarchical regression model based on 2003 Medicare administrative data, we calculated RSMRs for ranked and nonranked hospitals in the treatment of AMI. We identified ranked and nonranked hospitals with standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) significantly less than the mean expected for all hospitals in the study. RESULTS: We compared 13 662 patients in 50 ranked hospitals with 254 907 patients in 3813 nonranked hospitals. The RSMRs were lower in ranked vs nonranked hospitals (16.0% vs 17.9%, P<.001). The RSMR range for ranked vs nonranked hospitals overlapped (11.4%-20.0% vs 13.1%-23.3%, respectively). In an RSMR quartile distribution of all hospitals, 35 ranked hospitals (70%) were in the lowest RSMR or best performing quartile, 11 (22%) were in the middle 2 quartiles, and 4 (8%) were in the highest RSMR or worst performing quartile. There were 11 ranked hospitals (22%) and 28 nonranked hospitals (0.73%) that each had an SMR significantly less than 1 (defined by a 95% confidence interval with an upper limit of <1.0). CONCLUSIONS: On average, admission to a ranked hospital for AMI was associated with a lower risk of 30-day mortality, although about one-third of the ranked hospitals fell outside the best performing quartile based on RSMR. Although ranked hospitals were much more likely to have an SMR significantly less than 1, many more nonranked hospitals had this distinction.", "IMPORTANCE: The US News & World Report (USNWR) identifies the \"Best Hospitals\" for \"Cardiology and Heart Surgery.\" These rankings may have significant influence on patients and hospitals. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether USNWR top-ranked hospitals perform better than nonranked hospitals on mortality rates and readmission measures as well as patient satisfaction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This national retrospective study evaluated outcomes at 3552 US hospitals from 2014 to 2017. EXPOSURES: US News & World Report 2018 to 2019 Cardiology and Heart Surgery rankings (top-ranked vs nonranked hospitals). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospital-level 30-day risk-standardized mortality and readmission rates for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries age 65 years or older hospitalized for 3 cardiovascular conditions: acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) as well as Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems patient satisfaction star ratings obtained from publicly available Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services data. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality rates at top-ranked hospitals (n = 50), compared with nonranked hospitals (n = 3502), were lower for AMI (11.9% vs 13.2%, P < .001), HF (9.5% vs 11.9%; P < .001), and CABG (2.3%vs 3.3%; P < .001). Thirty-day readmission rates at the top-ranked hospitals (n = 50) when compared with nonranked hospitals (n = 2841) were similar for AMI (16.7% vs 16.5%; P = .64) and CABG (14.1% vs 13.7%; P = .15) but higher for HF (21.0% vs 19.2%; P < .001), Finally, patient satisfaction was higher at top-ranked hospitals (n = 50) compared with nonranked hospitals (n = 3412) (3.9 vs 3.3; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We found that USNWR top-ranked hospitals for cardiovascular care had lower 30-day mortality rates for AMI, HF, and CABG and higher patient satisfaction ratings compared with nonranked hospitals. However, 30-day readmission rates were either similar (for AMI and CABG) or higher (for HF) at top-ranked compared with nonranked hospitals. This discrepancy between readmissions and other performance measures raises concern that readmissions may not be an adequate metric of hospital care quality.", "OBJECTIVES: This study examined the degree to which hospital performance for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and heart failure (HF) care processes are correlated. BACKGROUND: Although AMI and HF care processes may be amenable to similar quality improvement interventions, whether these are indeed correlated and whether hospitals with consistently superior performance for both care metrics have the best outcomes remains unknown. METHODS: We compared hospital performance of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services AMI and HF core measures in 283 hospitals submitting 10 or more patients to the Get With The Guidelines AMI and HF programs between January 2005 and April 2009. RESULTS: Median hospital adherence to AMI and HF composite measures were 93% (interquartile range: 87% to 97%) and 92% (interquartile range: 85% to 96%), respectively, with only a modest correlation between hospital performance on these 2 composite metrics (r = 0.50; 95% confidence interval: 0.41 to 0.58). Hospitals with superior performance to both AMI and HF processes had significantly longer duration of Get With The Guidelines participation and lower adjusted in-hospital mortality (odds ratio: 0.79; 95% confidence interval: 0.63 to 0.99) for AMI and HF patients, whereas hospitals with superior adherence to either alone had similar mortality rates as hospitals with superior adherence to neither measure. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals that had consistent, superior performance for both AMI and HF care had significantly lower risk-adjusted mortality than those with superior performance either alone or for neither measure. Whether a single scoring system to assess global, rather than condition-specific, quality of cardiovascular care would facilitate care quality improvement more consistently and would optimize patient outcomes merits further investigation.", "OBJECTIVE: To assess revascularization and mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for all Medicare patients in fee-for-service (FFS) and health maintenance organization (HMO) settings in California. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Hospital discharge abstract and death certificate data linked with Medicare enrollment files for patients aged 65 and over with Medicare coverage (69,040) discharged from a California-licensed hospital in 1994-1996. STUDY DESIGN: Risk-adjusted results were assessed for HMOs and FFS, as well as for FFS beneficiaries from areas served by each plan. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Risk models were based on all sampled patients. The HMO patients were aggregated into 17 pseudoplans: 5 individual plans, 4 large plans split geographically (10 observations), and 2 \"pseudoplans\" of small HMOs. Observed versus expected 30-day mortality rates, lengths-of-stay (LOS) during the index hospitalization and any transfers, revascularization (coronary artery bypass graft [CABG] surgery and/or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA]) during the index hospitalization or 30 days after admission, were calculated for each pseudoplan. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Risk-adjusted death rate was slightly higher in FFS than in HMO settings (p < .01 with one risk adjustment model, n.s. with another). Three pseudoplans had significantly (p < .01) better than expected mortality rates. One pseudoplan was significantly worse (p < .05) with one risk adjustment model but not the other. The LOS and revascularization rates varied widely, but were not associated with outcomes. Plans with among the best results had the lowest LOS and revascularization rates. These pseudoplans were less likely to have their patients initially admitted to a hospital with revascularization capability, but the hospitals they used had higher CABG volumes. Even if CABG facilities were available during the index admission, in these plans with better than expected mortality rates, revascularization was often postponed or carried out elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: For Medicare patients having an AMI in the mid-1990s in California, risk-adjusted outcomes were no different, or slightly better on average, for those in HMOs than in FFS. Not all plans performed equally well, so understanding what leads to differences in quality is more important than simple comparisons of HMOs versus FFS."]}
{"question": "Can early second-look tympanoplasty reduce the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy?", "retrieved_passages": ["CONCLUSIONS: Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy. OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to report the rates of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma following primary CAT surgery and to report the rate of conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of a single surgeon series between 2006 and 2012. RESULTS: In total 132 second-look operations were undertaken, with a mean interval between primary surgery and second-look procedures of 6 months. The rate of cholesteatoma at second-look surgery was 19.7%, which was split into residual disease (10.6%) and recurrent disease (9.09%). New tympanic membrane defects with cholesteatoma were considered as recurrent disease. Residual disease was defined as cholesteatoma present behind an intact tympanic membrane. The majority of recurrent and residual disease was easily removed at second look (73.1%). Only four cases were converted to a modified radical mastoidectomy (3%) and three cases required a third-look procedure."]}
{"question": "Have antiepileptic drug prescription claims changed following the FDA suicidality warning?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: In January 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) communicated concerns and, in May 2009, issued a warning about an increased risk of suicidality for all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This research evaluated the association between the FDA suicidality communications and the AED prescription claims among members with epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder. METHODS: A longitudinal interrupted time-series design was utilized to evaluate Oklahoma Medicaid claims data from January 2006 through December 2009. The study included 9289 continuously eligible members with prevalent diagnoses of epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder and at least one AED prescription claim. Trends, expressed as monthly changes in the log odds of AED prescription claims, were compared across three time periods: before (January 2006 to January 2008), during (February 2008 to May 2009), and after (June 2009 to December 2009) the FDA warning. RESULTS: Before the FDA warning period, a significant upward trend of AED prescription claims of 0.01% per month (99% CI: 0.008% to 0.013%, p<0.0001) was estimated. In comparison to the prewarning period, no significant change in trend was detected during (-20.0%, 99% CI: -70.0% to 30.0%, p=0.34) or after (80.0%, 99% CI: -20.0% to 200.0%, p=0.03) the FDA warning period. After stratification, no diagnostic group (i.e., epilepsy alone, epilepsy and comorbid psychiatric disorder, and psychiatric disorder alone) experienced a significant change in trend during the entire study period (p>0.01). CONCLUSIONS: During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population."]}
{"question": "Can distal ureteral diameter predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To test the predictive value of distal ureteral diameter (UD) on reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with primary VUR between 2009 and 2012 who were managed by endoscopic injection. Seventy preoperative and postoperative voiding cystourethrograms were reviewed. The largest UD within the false pelvis was measured. The UD was divided by the L1-L3 vertebral body distance to get the UD ratio (UDR). One radiologist interpreted the findings of voiding cystourethrography in all patients. Clinical outcome was defined as reflux resolution. RESULTS: Seventy patients were enrolled in this series (17 boys and 53 girls). Mean age was 5.9 years (1.2-13 years). Grade III presented in 37 patients (53%), and 33 patients (47%) were of grade IV. Mean distal UD was 5.5 mm (2.5-13 mm). Mean UDR was 37.8% (18%-70%). Macroplastique injection was performed in all. Subureteric injection was performed in 60 patients (86%), whereas intraureteric injection was performed in 10 patients. No postoperative complications were detected. The effect of grade, UD, and UDR on success after endoscopic injection was tested. UD and UDR were significant predictors of reflux resolution on logistic regression analysis (P <.007 and .001, respectively). CONCLUSION: UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the predictive value of distal ureteral diameter ratio (UDR) on outcome of primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and reflux resolution after endoscopic injection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred eighty-three patients treated for primary VUR between January 2010 and October 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The parameters analyzed were age at diagnosis, sex, grade and lateralite of VUR, complaints at admission (febrile urinary tract infection, antenatal hydronephrosis, family history),bladder-bowel dysfunction (urgency, incontinence, constipation), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy findings, follow-up period, clinical course (spontaneous resolution or surgical correction), time of spontaneous resolution, surgical treatment time and age, materials used for injection and success of endoscopic injection. Ureteral diameter ratio was calculated on the initial VCUG at the time of the diagnosis as the largest ureteral diameter within the false pelvis divided by the distance between L1-L3.The correlation between UDR, clinical outcome (spontaneous resolution/surgical correction) and success of endoscopic injection was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. To compare the effect of UDR and grade of reflux on spontaneous resolution, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed in three models together with sex, age, resolution time, presence of febrile UTI and DMSA scan findings. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-three patients were enrolled. There was a strong correlation between UDR and grade of reflux (p < 0,0001). Ureteral diameter ratio was higher in patients whose complaints at admission were family history and febrile UTI, but this correlation was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). When the correlation between UDR and the DMSA scan findings was evaluated, UDR was found to be significantly higher in patients with moderate and severe scarring. Bladder-bowel dysfunction was present in 111 patients (28.9%). There was no significant correlation between BBD and UDR (p > 0.05). 62 patients showed spontaneous resolution in a median duration of 1.55 years. The predictive value of UDR for spontaneous resolution was more significant than grade (p < 0.001).There was no spontaneous resolution in patients with UDR over 0.45.321 patients underwent operation (248 endoscopic injection, 17 ureteroneocystostomy, 56 endoscopic injection+ureteroneocystostomy). When the predictive value of the reflux grade and UDR in the success rate of endoscopic correction was compared, UDR was shown to be significantly more predictive than the grade of reflux (p < 0.05). Ureteral diameter ratio was significantly higher in patients whose injection treatment was unsuccessful. Each 0.05 unit increase in UDR affected the success of endoscopic injection negatively (95% CI:<0.001-0.071). CONCLUSION: Ureteral diameter ratio is an objective measurement of VUR and appears to be a new predictive tool for clinical outcome and success after endoscopic injection."]}
{"question": "Is leptin involved in phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: Hyperleptinemia and oxidative stress play a major role in the development of cardiovascular diseases in obesity. This study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between plasma levels of leptin and phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, and its potential relevance in the vascular remodeling in obese patients. METHODS: The study was performed in 164 obese and 94 normal-weight individuals (controls). NADPH oxidase activity was evaluated by luminescence in phagocytic cells. Levels of leptin were quantified by ELISA in plasma samples. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography. In addition, we performed in-vitro experiments in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophages. RESULTS: Phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity and leptin levels were enhanced (P < 0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. NADPH oxidase activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients. This association remained significant in a multivariate analysis. cIMT was higher (P < 0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. In addition, cIMT also correlated positively with leptin and NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. In-vitro studies showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Inhibition of the leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activity by wortmannin and bisindolyl maleimide suggested a direct involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C pathways, respectively. Finally, leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activation promoted macrophage proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity is increased in obesity and is related to preclinical atherosclerosis in this condition. We also suggest that hyperleptinemia may contribute to phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity."]}
{"question": "Is alexithymia a risk factor for unexplained physical symptoms in general medical outpatients?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: Alexithymia is presumed to play an important predisposing role in the pathogenesis of medically unexplained physical symptoms. However, no research on alexithymia has been done among general medical outpatients who present with medically unexplained physical symptoms as their main problem and in which anxiety and depression have been considered as possible confounding factors. This study investigated whether patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms are more alexithymic than those with explained symptoms and whether, in patients with unexplained symptoms, alexithymia is associated with subjective health experience and use of medical services. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among patients attending an internal medicine outpatient clinic. All patients were given a standardized interview and completed a number of questionnaires. RESULTS: After complete physical examinations, 169 of 321 patients had unexplained physical symptoms according to two independent raters. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms more often had a mental disorder, but overall they were not more alexithymic. In patients with unexplained physical symptoms, alexithymia was not associated with subjective health experience or use of medical services. However, patients with both unexplained symptoms and a mental disorder who also denied any possible connection between emotional problems and their physical symptoms did have more alexithymic traits. CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms, alexithymia does not play a role of clinical significance. Patients with unexplained physical symptoms are heterogeneous with respect to psychiatric syndrome pathology and probably also with respect to personality pathology.", "BACKGROUND: Alexithymia is thought to be associated with the development of medically unexplained physical symptoms (UPS). So far little research has been published on alexithymia as a risk factor for the persistence of UPS. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical outcome in UPS patients and to study the relative importance of alexithymia in predicting that outcome. METHODS: A follow-up study was conducted among general medical outpatients with UPS. Patients underwent extensive examinations at baseline and were reassessed after a mean 61-week interval. Outcome of the UPS and general health perception at follow-up were used as major outcome variables. RESULTS: Outcome of the UPS and general health perception at follow-up were not strongly associated with each other. More than half (63%) of the patients reported improvement of their initial symptoms, but only 38% of the patients considered themselves at follow-up to be in good health. UPS outcome was predominantly predicted by the duration of the UPS and the number of additional physical symptoms at baseline. General health perception at follow-up was predominantly predicted by the general health perception at baseline and the number of additional physical symptoms and pain experience at baseline. The explained variance of the general health perception was three times as high as the explained variance for the UPS outcome. Alexithymia was not associated with any of the two outcome variables. CONCLUSIONS: Outcome of the UPS and general health perception at follow-up are not strongly associated and are predicted by different variables. Alexithymia, however, is not an important predictor for the outcome in the majority of UPS patients.", "BACKGROUND: Somatic symptom disorder is described as excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to physical symptoms. The presence of somatic symptoms has been associated with depression, alexithymia, and the presence of chronic pain. Individuals with somatic symptom disorder are frequent attenders of primary health care services. AIM: We focused on investigating if the presence of psychological symptoms, alexithymia, or pain could be risk factors for somatic symptoms in a secondary health care service. METHODS: A cross-sectional and observational study. A total of 136 Mexican individuals who regularly attend a secondary health care service were recruited. The Visual Analogue Scale for Pain Assessment, the Symptom Checklist 90, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 were applied. RESULTS: Of all the participants, 45.2% showed somatic symptoms. We observed that these individuals more frequently presented with complaints of pain (chi(2) = 18.4, p < .001), as well as more severe (t = -4.6, p < .001), and prolonged (chi(2) = 4.9, p = 0.02). They also exhibited higher severity in all psychological dimensions assessed (p < .001). Finally, cardiovascular disease (t = 2.52, p = .01), pain intensity (t = 2.94, p = .005), and SCL-90 depression (t = 7.58, p < .001) were associated with somatic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed a high frequency of somatic symptoms in outpatients attending secondary health care services. They may be accompanied by comorbid cardiovascular conditions, higher pain intensity, and other mental health-related symptoms, which may aggravate the general clinical picture presented by the patient seeking health care. The presence and severity of somatization should be taken into consideration in the first and second level health care services for an early mental state evaluation and treatment of these outpatients to have a better clinical assessment and health outcome.", "OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of medically unexplained rheumatic symptoms amongst patients newly referred to a rheumatology out-patient service and to examine their relationship with pain, disability, socioeconomic factors and the presence of emotional disorders (anxiety, depression and panic). METHODS: A sample of newly referred consecutive patients to a hospital-based, regional rheumatology service was administered a questionnaire for assessment of emotional disorders, pain, health status and socioeconomic factors. Rheumatologists rated the degree to which patients' symptoms were explained by organic disease (organicity rating). RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-six patients were eligible and 203 (79%) participated. The sample included 69% females and mean age was 50 yr. Ninety-three (46%) had symptoms that were completely explained, 52 (26%) largely explained, 41 (20%) somewhat explained and 17 (8%) not at all explained by organic disease. Patients whose symptoms were of \"low organicity\" (somewhat or not at all explained) were more likely to be female [relative risk (RR) 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.1], younger (mean age 44 vs 52 yr, P<0.001) and to report more somatic symptoms (median 2 vs 1, P=0.021). On univariate analysis they were more likely to be experiencing financial hardship (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6) and work dissatisfaction (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.4) and to live in rented housing (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.8) or with dependent relatives (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.5). Logistic regression showed that female gender and living in rented housing were the significant independent predictors of low organicity. Organicity ratings were not associated with pain severity, disability, physical and mental health status or the presence of emotional disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-nine per cent of patients newly referred to rheumatology clinics had symptoms that were poorly explained by identifiable rheumatic disease. Having unexplained symptoms was associated with socioeconomic factors but not levels of pain, disability or emotional disorders."]}
{"question": "Do mossy fibers release GABA?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: Mossy fibers are the sole excitatory projection from dentate gyrus granule cells to the hippocampus, forming part of the trisynaptic hippocampal circuit. They undergo significant plasticity during epileptogenesis and have been implicated in seizure generation. Mossy fibers are a highly unusual projection in the mammalian brain; in addition to glutamate, they release adenosine, dynorphin, zinc, and possibly other peptides. Mossy fiber terminals also show intense immunoreactivity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and immunoreactivity for GAD67. The purpose of this review is to present physiologic evidence of GABA release by mossy fibers and its modulation by epileptic activity. METHODS: We used hippocampal slices from 3- to 5-week-old guinea pigs and made whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells. We placed stimulating electrodes in stratum granulosum and adjusted their position in order to recruit mossy fiber to CA3 projections. RESULTS: We have shown that electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons. These inhibitory signals satisfy the criteria that distinguish mossy fiber-CA3 synapses: high sensitivity to metabotropic glutamate-receptor agonists, facilitation during repetitive stimulation, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-independent long-term potentiation. CONCLUSIONS: We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "Hippocampal mossy fibers of young rodents have been reported to corelease inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in addition to excitatory transmitter glutamate. In this study, we aimed at re-evaluating this corelease hypothesis of both inhibitory and excitatory transmitters in the hippocampus. Electrophysiological examination revealed that, in juvenile mice and rats of the two to 3 weeks old, stimulation at the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus elicited monosynaptic GABAergic IPSCs in CA3 neurons in the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) blockers, only when rather strong stimuli were given. The group II mGluR agonist (2S,1'R,2'R,3'R)-2-(2,3-dicarboxycyclo-propyl)glycine (DCG-IV), which selectively suppresses transmission at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse, abolished almost all postsynaptic responses elicited by the weak stimuli, whereas those by strong stimuli were inhibited only slightly. In addition, the minimal stimulation elicited GABAergic IPSCs in neonatal mice of the first postnatal week, whereas these responses are not sensitive to DCG-IV. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that mossy fiber terminals expressed GABA and the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD67, although the expression levels were much weaker than those in the inhibitory interneurons. Notably, the expression levels of the vesicular GABA transporter were much lower than those of GABA and GAD67, and almost below detection threshold. These results suggest that mossy fiber synapses are purely glutamatergic and apparent monosynaptic IPSCs so far reported are evoked by costimulation of inhibitory interneurons, at least in young mice and rats. Hippocampal mossy fiber terminals synthesize and store GABA, but have limited ability in vesicular release for GABA in the developing rodents.", "It has been hypothesized that, in the developing rodent hippocampus, mossy fiber terminals release GABA together with glutamate. Here, we used transgenic glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 (GAD67)-GFP expressing mice and multi-label immunohistochemistry to address whether glutamatergic and GABAergic markers are colocalized. We demonstrate that in the dentate gyrus, interneurons positive for GABA/GAD are sparsely distributed along the edge of the hilus, in a different pattern from that of the densely packed granule cells. Co-staining for synaptophysin and vesicular glutamate transporter1 (VGLUT1) in postnatal day 14 brain sections from both mice and rats showed mossy fiber terminals as a group of large (2-5 mum in diameter) VGLUT1-positive excitatory presynaptic terminals in the stratum lucidum of area CA3a/b. Furthermore, co-staining for synaptophysin and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) revealed a group of small-sized ( approximately 0.5 mum in diameter) inhibitory presynaptic terminals in the same area where identified mossy fiber terminals were present. The two types of terminals appeared to be mutually exclusive, and showed no colocalization. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis that GABA is released as a neurotransmitter from mossy fiber terminals during development.", "The hippocampal mossy fibers (MFs), the axons of the granule cells (GCs) of the dentate gyrus, innervate mossy cells and interneurons in the hilus on their way to CA3 where they innervate interneurons and pyramidal cells. Synapses on each target cell have distinct anatomical and functional characteristics. In recent years, the paradigmatic view of the MF synapses being only glutamatergic and, thus, excitatory has been questioned. Several laboratories have provided data supporting the hypothesis that the MFs can transiently release GABA during development and, in the adult, after periods of enhanced excitability. This transient glutamate-GABA co-transmission coincides with the transient up-regulation of the machinery for the synthesis and release of GABA in the glutamatergic GCs. Although some investigators have deemed this evidence controversial, new data has appeared with direct evidence of co-release of glutamate and GABA from single, identified MF boutons. However, this must still be confirmed by other groups and with other methodologies. A second, intriguing observation is that MF activation produced fast spikelets followed by excitatory postsynaptic potentials in a number of pyramidal cells, which, unlike the spikelets, underwent frequency potentiation and were strongly depressed by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. The spikelets persisted during blockade of chemical transmission and were suppressed by the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone. These data are consistent with the hypothesis of mixed electrical-chemical synapses between MFs and some pyramidal cells. Dye coupling between these types of principal cells and ultrastructural studies showing the co-existence of AMPA receptors and connexin 36 in this synapse corroborate their presence. A deeper consideration of mixed neurotransmission taking place in this synapse may expand our search and understanding of communication channels between different regions of the mammalian CNS.", "The granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG), origin of the mossy fibers (MFs), have been considered to be glutamatergic. However, data obtained with different experimental approaches in recent years may be calling for a redefinition of their phenotype. Although they indeed release glutamate for fast neurotransmission, immunohistological and molecular biology evidence has revealed that these glutamatergic cells also express GABAergic markers. The granule cell expression of a GABAergic phenotype is developmentally regulated. Electrophysiological studies reveal that during the first 3 weeks of age, mossy fiber stimulation provokes monosynaptic fast inhibitory transmission mediated by GABA, besides the monosynaptic excitatory glutamatergic transmission, onto their targets in CA3. After this age, mossy fiber GABAergic transmission abruptly disappears and the GABAergic markers are undetected. In the adult, the GABAergic markers are upregulated and GABA-mediated transmission emerges after induction of hyperexcitability. The simultaneous glutamate- and GABA-mediated signals share the same plastic and pharmacological characteristics that correspond to neurotransmission of mossy fiber origin. This intriguing evidence gives rise to two fundamental points of discussion. The first is the plausible fact that glutamate and GABA, two neurotransmitters of opposing actions, are coreleased from the mossy fibers. The second relates to its functional implications that can be immediately inferred, as the dentate gyrus can exert direct GABA-mediated excitatory actions early in life and inhibitory actions in young and adult hippocampus. This evidence poses the need to reevaluate and reinterpret some aspects of the physiology of the mossy fiber pathway under normal and pathological conditions. This work reviews the recent evidence that supports the assumption that glutamate and GABA can be coreleased from a single pathway, the mossy fibers, and makes some considerations about its functional implications."]}
{"question": "The clinical significance of bile duct sludge: is it different from bile duct stones?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Some patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones are found to have sludge and no stones. Although sludge in the gallbladder is a precursor of gallbladder stones, the significance of bile duct sludge (BDS) is poorly defined. This study aimed to compare BDS with bile duct stones in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy. METHODS: The study enrolled 228 patients who underwent therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected choledocholithiasis. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with BDS but no stones on ERCP and patients with CBD stones. The presence of risk factors for bile duct stones (age, periampullary diverticulum, ductal dilation or angulation, previous open cholecystectomy) were assessed at ERCP. Follow-up data (36 +/- 19 months) were obtained from medical records and by patient questioning. RESULTS: Bile duct sludge occurred in 14% (31/228) of patients and was more common in females. After endoscopic clearance, CBD stones recurred in 17% (33/197) of the patients with CBD stones, and in 16% (5/31) of the patients with BDS (p = 0.99). Common bile duct dilation was less common in the sludge group. The other known risk factors for recurrent CBD stones (age, previous open cholecystectomy, bile duct angulation, and the presence of a peripampullary diverticulum) were not statistically different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "A national survey of pathologic features of hepatolithiasis was conducted in Japan. The significance of hepatobiliary lesions in the pathogenesis of hepatolithiasis was evaluated in 31 autopsy livers and 242 surgically resected livers. Eighty-two percent shared several morphologic and clinical features, eg, the presence of multiple calcium bilirubinate or brown pigment stones within the intrahepatic duct and a characteristic hepatobiliary morphology. These cases were distributed throughout Japan without distinct geographic differences. The stones were found in the left and/or right hepatic duct and/or their tributaries. The ducts that contained stones had uneven dilatation of their lumena with focal stenosis. The walls of the involved ducts were thickened mainly by fibrosis. The hepatic parenchyma associated with stones within intrahepatic bile ducts showed mild to severe atrophy and fibrosis. Histologically, the ducts that contained stones showed fibrosis, proliferation of mucous and serous glands, and inflammatory cell infiltration in their walls and the periductal tissue. A large amount of mucus secreted from the affected ducts was seen within the biliary sludge and calcium bilirubinate stones were found in the involved ductal lumena. These findings suggest that the large amount of mucus and the formation of unevenly dilated ductal lumena may be important in the formation of intrahepatic calculi because these factors may favor nucleation and promote local bile stasis, thereby accentuating the ductal changes and stone formation (a vicious cycle).", "OBJECTIVE: In up to 20% of patients, the aetiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) remains elusive and is thus called idiopathic. On more detailed review these cases can often be explained through biliary disease and are amenable to treatment. Findings range from biliary sludge to microlithiasis but their definitions remain fluid and controversial. DESIGN: A systematic literature review (1682 reports, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines) analysed definitions of biliary sludge and microlithiasis, followed by an online international expert survey (30 endoscopic ultrasound/hepatobiliary and pancreatic experts; 36 items) which led to definitions of both. These were consented by Delphi voting and clinically evaluated in a retrospective cohort of patients with presumed biliary pancreatitis. RESULTS: In 13% of original articles and 19.2% of reviews, microlithiasis and biliary sludge were used synonymously. In the survey, 41.7% of experts described the term 'sludge' and 'microlithiasis' as identical findings. As a consequence, three definitions were proposed, agreed on and confirmed by voting to distinctly discriminate between biliary sludge (hyperechoic material without acoustic shadowing) and microlithiasis (echorich calculi of </=5 mm with acoustic shadowing) as opposed to larger biliary stones, both for location in gallbladder and bile ducts. In an initial attempt to investigate the clinical relevance in a retrospective analysis in 177 confirmed cases in our hospital, there was no difference in severity of AP if caused by sludge, microlithiasis or stones. CONCLUSION: We propose a consensus definition for the localisation, ultrasound morphology and diameter of biliary sludge and microlithiasis as distinct entities. Interestingly, severity of biliary AP was not dependent on the size of concrements warranting prospective randomised studies which treatment options are adequate to prevent recurrence.", "A prospective study of laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) for evaluation of the common bile duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy was started in October 1993. LUS during cholecystectomy was performed routinely to preoperatively identify unsuspected stones. Three-hundred thirty patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis were included in the study. The preoperative work-up included endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in 49 patients. Common bile duct (CBD) stones were found in 22 cases; in 19 cases the stones were removed successfully by endoscopic sphincterotomy. LUS successfully visualized the CBD in all but 10 patients (3%). CBD stones were found in 17 patients and confirmed by preoperative cholangiography and/or CBD exploration. There were two false-negative and one false-positive result for LUS. In 47 patients (14.2%) LUS detected CBD sludge as low-amplitude echoes without acoustic shadowing. The presence of CBD sludge was correlated with some biochemical and clinical variables. A significant correlation was identified between the absence or presence of CBD sludge and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, acute pancreatitis, gallbladder sludge, age, and the levels of serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. A significant difference was recorded between CBD diameter and the presence or absence of stones or sludge (p = 0.00001). In our experience, LUS allowed good diagnosis of CBD stones during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The clinical significance of CBD sludge remains to be elucidated.", "BACKGROUND: To aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of the state-of-the-art magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) comprising several 2D and 3D hydrographic sequences in patients after liver transplantation with biliary-enteric and duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis included MRC examinations of 42 patients (21 men, 21 women) performed from 18 days to 86 months (average, 18.9 months) after liver transplantation. Studies were carried out on 1.5 T units, using 4 hydrographic (turbo spin echo, TSE) sequences. The analysis included accuracy of MRC in detecting biliary complications, as well as frequency of specific complications in patients with biliary-enteric anastomosis (n=15) and duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis (n=27). In 34 patients the results were correlated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ERCP (n=9), ERCP and CT (n=5), ERCP and percutaneous cholangiography (n=2), ERCP and T-tube cholangiography (n=1), ERCP, PTC, and histopathology (n=1), PTC (n=1), PTC and CT (n=1), PTC and histopathology (n=1), T-tube cholangiography (n=4), T-tube cholangiography and CT (n=1), fistulography (n=1), CT (n=4), and histopathology (n=3). In the remaining 8 patients other imaging studies (US, CT, follow-up MRC), laboratory liver function tests, and clinical status were the standard of reference. Results MRC yielded 94.6% sensitivity in detecting biliary complications in patients after liver transplantation. In patients with biliary-enteric anastomosis, disseminated biliary strictures were more frequent than in patients with duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis (20% vs. 7%). Less frequently, the biliary-enteric anastomosis was accompanied by anastomotic strictures (40% vs. 56%) and the presence of stones/sludge (20% vs. 37%), but the differences did not show statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: MRC allowed accurate diagnosis of biliary complications in patients after liver transplantation and therefore can be used as a safe alternative to invasive diagnostic procedures such as ERCP and PTC, especially in patients with biliary-enteric anastomosis, in which invasive diagnostic procedures are technically challenging. The main limitation of MR hydrography is its low accuracy in distinguishing bilomas from other fluid collections."]}
{"question": "Does a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program improve bariatric surgery outcomes?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Although bariatric surgery has been identified as an effective treatment for weight loss in the morbidly obese, some patients regain weight postoperatively. A pre-treatment program focused on changing lifestyle behaviors could facilitate improved post-surgical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine patient satisfaction and perceived usefulness of a preoperative program. METHOD: Participants completed a bariatric surgery program that incorporated a 6-week behavior modification component before the surgery date. A selfreport questionnaire was sent to individuals who had completed the program. The questionnaire assessed demographics, satisfaction with the pre-surgery program, and patients' perceived usefulness of the program. RESULTS: Of 124 questionnaires sent, 70 were returned (56%). Participants had a mean age of 46.3 years. The majority of participants were Caucasian (97.1%), female (78.6%), and employed (68.6%). Mean preoperative BMI was 55.3; mean postoperative BMI was 36.3. Participants were 1 year post-surgery (mean 48.8 weeks). Patients were very satisfied with the overall program (mean Likert score 4.51), as well as with the behavior modification groups (mean 4.44). They found the groups to be very useful in making postoperative changes (mean 4.45).

Patients were divided in two groups: those with BMI of 35-45 were not required to achieve a weight loss goal prior to surgery (no-WLG group) while those with BMI > 45 were given a weight loss goal proportionate to their weight (WLG group). Body mass index (BMI), history of diabetes mellitus type-II (DM-II), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were recorded at baseline and 4 years postoperatively. Length of hospital stay (LOS) and reinterventions were considered proxies for postoperative morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 776 patients, 81.4% LRYGB, were included in the study (age 45.1 +/- 11.9). There was no difference in %DeltaBMI, DM-II, HDL, HTN, LOS, or reinterventions among the two groups at 4 years postoperatively in both LRNY and LSG patients. This lack of difference persisted even when patients with similar BMI (43-45 vs 45.01-47) were compared. CONCLUSION: WLG group did not have decreased perioperative morbidity, nor improved weight loss and comorbidity resolution 4 years after surgery. While these findings should also be confirmed by multicenter trials, they question the value of mandated WLG prior to bariatric surgery as they seem ineffective and may limit patient access to surgery.", "INTRODUCTION: In 2013 the Department of Health specified eligibility for bariatric surgery funded by the National Health Service. This included a mandatory specification that patients first complete a Tier 3 medical weight management programme. The clinical effectiveness of this recommendation has not been evaluated previously. Our bariatric centre has provided a Tier 3 programme six months prior to bariatric surgery since 2009. The aim of our retrospective study was to compare weight loss in two cohorts: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass only (RYGB only cohort) versus Tier 3 weight management followed by RYGB (Tier 3 cohort). METHODS: A total of 110 patients were selected for the study: 66 in the RYGB only cohort and 44 in the Tier 3 cohort. Patients in both cohorts were matched for age, sex, preoperative body mass index and pre-existing co-morbidities. The principal variable was therefore whether they undertook the weight management programme prior to RYGB. Patients from both cohorts were followed up at 6 and 12 months to assess weight loss. RESULTS: The mean weight loss at 6 months for the Tier 3 cohort was 31% (range: 18-69%, standard deviation [SD]: 0.10 percentage points) compared with 23% (range: 4-93%, SD: 0.12 percentage points) for the RYGB only cohort (p=0.0002). The mean weight loss at 12 months for the Tier 3 cohort was 34% (range: 17-51%, SD: 0.09 percentage points) compared with 27% (range: 14-48%, SD: 0.87 percentage points) in the RYGB only cohort (p=0.0037). CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that in our matched cohorts, patients receiving Tier 3 specialist medical weight management input prior to RYGB lost significantly more weight at 6 and 12 months than RYGB only patients. This confirms the clinical efficacy of such a weight management programme prior to gastric bypass surgery and supports its inclusion in eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery.", "BACKGROUND: Many insurance companies require patient participation in a medically supervised weight management program (WMP) before offering approval for bariatric surgery. Clinical data surrounding benefits of participation are limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between preoperative insurance-mandated WMP participation and postoperative outcomes in bariatric surgery patients. SETTING: Regional referral center and teaching hospital. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who underwent vertical sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between January 2014 and January 2016 was performed. Patients (N = 354) were divided into 2 cohorts and analyzed according to presence (n = 266) or absence (n = 88) of an insurance-mandated WMP requirement. Primary endpoints included rate of follow-up and percent of excess weight loss (%EWL) at postoperative months 1, 3, 6, and 12. All patients, regardless of the insurance-mandated WMP requirement, followed a program-directed preoperative diet. RESULTS: The majority of patients with an insurance-mandated WMP requirement had private insurance (63.9%). Both patient groups experienced a similar proportion of readmissions and reoperations, rate of follow-up, and %EWL at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (P = NS). Median operative duration and hospital length of stay were also similar between groups. Linear regression analysis revealed no significant improvement in %EWL at 12 months in the yes-WMP group. CONCLUSION: These data show that patients who participate in an insurance-mandated WMP in addition to completing a program-directed preoperative diet experience no significant benefit to rate of readmission, reoperation, follow-up, or %EWL up to 12 months postoperation. Our findings suggest that undergoing bariatric surgery without completing an insurance-mandated WMP is safe and effective.", "BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of an inpatient low-calorie program for a substantial decrease of preoperative weight (>10 points in BMI) in superobese patients. METHODS: Five patients were hospitalized for an average of 11 weeks and were placed on a low-calorie liquid diet (<900 kcal/day) and an exercise program. Following a drop of ten points in BMI, they underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Hemoglobin A1c and lipid profiles were obtained at the beginning of the diet, prior to surgery and at the last follow-up appointment. Our results were compared to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, which included 1,046 bariatric operations performed at VA centers between October 1999 and August 2007. RESULTS: All five patients were massively obese men (body mass index (BMI) = 64.3 +/- 2.1 kg/m(2); 54.7 +/- 2.6 years old; four of five were white) with multiple comorbid conditions, which placed them in a substantially higher risk for bariatric surgery. Of the four diabetic patients, two were insulin dependent. There was an average decrease in BMI by 12.7 points (85.8 +/- 6.0 lb) during the preoperative diet period (11 weeks). All patients underwent RYGB without complications. This cohort of patients further decreased their BMI by 10.6 points (88.4 +/- 29.4 lb) following surgical intervention. The total combined preoperative and postoperative excess body weight loss was 89% (10.6-month average follow-up). Sleep apnea resolved following gastric bypass but did not improve during the preoperative weight loss period. Hypertension, osteoarthritis, and dyslipidemia all improved following surgical intervention. Hemoglobin A1c decreased by 1.9% during diet-induced weight loss with no further improvement being noted after surgery. The two insulin-dependent diabetic patients discontinued insulin therapy following surgery. The NSQIP database contained 77 patients with similar characteristics to our cohort of patients. The 30-day mortality for this cohort of patients was 3.9% with a complication rate of 33.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Massive preoperative weight loss is possible to achieve with a liquid protein diet in superobese patients greatly facilitating gastric bypass surgery in an otherwise high-risk patient population."]}
{"question": "Is solitary kidney really more resistant to ischemia?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To our knowledge there are no evidence-based medicine data to date to critically judge the vulnerability of a solitary kidney to warm ischemia compared to paired kidneys. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten dogs were exposed to open right nephrectomy to create a solitary kidney model (group 1). Ten dogs with both kidneys were considered group 2. All dogs underwent warm ischemia by open occlusion of the left renal artery for 90 minutes. Dogs were sacrificed at different intervals (3 days to 4 weeks). All dogs were reevaluated by renogram before sacrifice and histopathology of the investigated kidney. The proinflammatory markers CD95 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In group 1 clearance decreased by 20% at 1 week but basal function was regained starting at week 2. In group 2 clearance decreased more than 90% up to week 2. Recovery started at week 3 and by 4 weeks there was a 23% clearance reduction. Histopathological examination in group 1 revealed significant tubular necrosis (60%) at 3 days with regeneration starting at 1 week. In group 2 there was more pronounced tubular necrosis (90%) with regeneration starting at 2 weeks. The expression of proinflammatory markers was up-regulated in each group with higher, more sustained expression in group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.", "In this study the consequences of unilateral nephrectomy on the survival rate of rats were examined under severe pathological conditions including injection of a lethal dose of endotoxin (exogenic LPS), cecal puncture (endogenic LPS), injection of LPS concomitantly with renal ischemia as well as a simultaneous injection of LPS and glycerol to the leg muscle in order to induce acute renal failure. Sham operated rats did not exhibit higher survival rates than the nephrectomized rats. In most cases there was even a decrease in the percent age rate of deaths in the nephrectomized rats. Improvement in the resistance of the nephrectomized rats to pathophysiological stress occurred when stress was induced immediately following nephrectomy as well as when stress was induced 30 days following nephrectomy. No significant differences were found in blood pressure, heart rate, hematocrit, rate of respiration and body temperature in the nephrectomized rats as compared to rats that did not undergo nephrectomy. A possible explanation for our results is that the solitary kidney excretes more LPS into the urine.", "In this study the consequences of unilateral nephrectomy on the survival rate of rats were examined under severe pathological conditions including injection of a lethal dose of endotoxin (exogenic LPS), cecal puncture (endogenic LPS), injection of LPS concomitantly with renal ischemia as well as a simultaneous injection of LPS and glycerol to the leg muscle in order to induce acute renal failure.

{"question": "SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) in patients with essential tremor. Is there any correlation with Parkinson's disease?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: The differential diagnosis between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may be, in some cases, very difficult on clinical grounds alone. In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals. RESULTS: Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, it appears that ET patients have a small degree of striatal dopaminergic degeneration. If this is due to alterations in the nigrostriatl pathway or of other origin it is not clear. Follow-up studies of essential tremor patients are warranted to assess progression of disease and to understand better the possible cause for striatal dopaminergic degeneration."]}
{"question": "Is minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords reproducible and applicable in routine surgery?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: Traditional resectional techniques and chordal transfer are difficult to apply in video-assisted mitral valve repair. Using artificial chords appears easier in this setting. The purpose of this study was to review the effectiveness and reproducibility of neochordal repair as a routine approach to minimally invasive mitral repair, and to assess the stability of neochord implantation using the figure-of-eight suture without pledgets in this setting. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent minimally invasive video-assisted mitral valve repair from 2008 to 2013. The primary endpoints were recurrent mitral regurgitation and reoperation. RESULTS: A total of 426 consecutive patients were included during the study period, with a mean age of 55 +/- 18 years. Neochords were used in all patients, and in association with leaflet resection in 47 patients. One patient was not repairable and underwent valve replacement (repair rate, 99.8%). Fifteen patients had Grade I (3.5%) regurgitation, whereas the remainder had none. Patients were fast-tracked, with 25% extubated in the operation theatre and the remainder within 6 h. There were 5 deaths within 30 days (1.2%). Follow-up ranged 3-60 months, during which all of the patients remained with no or trace mitral regurgitation. No de-insertion or rupture of any neochords was found, and no patients required a reoperation. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery."]}
{"question": "Outcomes of severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health service: does trauma center level make a difference?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Trauma centers are designated to provide systematized multidisciplinary care to injured patients. Effective trauma systems reduce patient mortality by facilitating the treatment of injured patients at appropriately resourced hospitals. Several U.S. studies report reduced mortality among patients admitted directly to a level I trauma center compared with those admitted to hospitals with less resources. It has yet to be shown whether there is an outcome benefit associated with the \"level of hospital\" initially treating severely injured trauma patients in Australia. This study was designed to determine whether the level of trauma center providing treatment impacts mortality and/or hospital length of stay. METHODS: Outcomes were evaluated for severely injured trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15 using NSW Institute of Trauma and Injury Management data from 2002-2007 for our regional health service. To assess the association between trauma centers and binary outcomes, a logistic regression model was used. To assess the association between trauma centers and continuous outcomes, a multivariable linear regression model was used. Sex, age, and ISS were included as covariates in all models. RESULTS: There were 1,986 trauma presentations during the 6-year period. Patients presenting to a level III trauma center had a significantly higher risk of death than those presenting to the level I center, regardless of age, sex, ISS, or prehospital time. Peer review of deaths at the level III center identified problems in care delivery in 15 cases associated with technical errors, delay in decision making, or errors of judgement. CONCLUSION: Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "AIM: Whether treatment at paediatric trauma centres (PTCs) provides a survival advantage for injured children over treatment at adult trauma centres (ATCs) remains inconclusive. This study examines the association between trauma centre type and in-hospital mortality for severely injured paediatric trauma patients in New South Wales, Australia. METHODS: A retrospective examination of paediatric patient characteristics (aged </=15 years), treatment and injury outcome was conducted using data from the New South Wales Trauma Registry for 2009-2014. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of in-hospital mortality and type of trauma centre. RESULTS: There were 1230 children who were severely injured (i.e. Injury Severity Score; ISS > 12) and 81.0% received definitive care at a PTC. Two-thirds were male, 37.8% were aged 11-15 years and falls represented 32.0% of the injuries. Almost half (48.9%) the injured children had an ISS between 16 and 24, 31.9% between 25 and 39 and 3.8% an ISS between 40 and 75. The mean and median hospital length of stay was 17.5 and 5 days, respectively. Fifty percent of children that received definitive care at a PTC were admitted to an ICU compared to 23.9% at a Level 1 ATC. There were 119 (9.7%) in-hospital deaths. Children aged </=15 years who were treated at a Level 1 ATC had 6.1 times higher odds of not surviving their injuries than if treated at a PTC. CONCLUSION: Children who received definitive care at a PTC had a survival advantage compared to those treated at a Level 1 ATC. Prospectively examining the processes of care for severely injured children may assist in identification of quality and system changes required to ensure optimal trauma care within the health-care system.", "BACKGROUND: Accurate economic data are fundamental for improving current funding models and ultimately in promoting the efficient delivery of services. The financial burden of a high trauma casemix to designated trauma centres in Australia has not been previously determined, and there is some evidence that the episode funding model used in Australia results in the underfunding of trauma. AIM: To describe the costs of acute trauma admissions in trauma centres, identify predictors of higher treatment costs and cost variance in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data linkage of admitted trauma patient and financial data provided by 12 Level 1 NSW trauma centres for the 08/09 financial year was performed. Demographic, injury details and injury scores were obtained from trauma registries. Individual patient general ledger costs (actual trauma patient costs), Australian Refined Diagnostic Related Groups (AR-DRG) and state-wide average costs (which form the basis of funding) were obtained. The actual costs incurred by the hospital were then compared with the state-wide AR-DRG average costs. Multivariable multiple linear regression was used for identifying predictors of costs. RESULTS: There were 17,522 patients, the average per patient cost was $10,603 and the median was $4628 (interquartile range: $2179-10,148). The actual costs incurred by trauma centres were on average $134 per bed day above AR-DRG costs-determined costs. Falls, road trauma and violence were the highest causes of total cost. Motor cyclists and pedestrians had higher median costs than motor vehicle occupants. As a result of greater numbers, patients with minor injury had comparable total costs with those generated by patients with severe injury. However the median cost of severely injured patients was nearly four times greater. The count of body regions injured, sex, length of stay, serious traumatic brain injury and admission to the Intensive Care Unit were significantly associated with increased costs (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This multicentre trauma costing study demonstrated the feasibility of trauma registry and financial data linkage. Discrepancies between the observed costs of care in these 12 trauma centres and the NSW average AR-DRG costs suggest that trauma care is currently underfunded in NSW.", "BACKGROUND: Head injury is the leading cause of death and long term disability from bicycle injuries and may be prevented by helmet wearing. We compared the pattern of injury in major trauma victims resulting from bicyclist injury admitted to hospitals in the State of Victoria, Australia and South-West Netherlands, with respective high and low prevalence of helmet use among bicyclists. METHODS: A cohort of bicycle injured patients with serious injury (defined as Injury Severity Score>15) in South-West Netherlands, was compared to a cohort of serious injured bicyclists in the State of Victoria, Australia. Additionally, the cohorts of patients with serious injury admitted to a Dutch level 1 trauma centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands and an Australian level 1 trauma centre in Melbourne, Australia were compared. Both cohorts included patients admitted between July 2001 and June 2009. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and secondary outcome was prevalence of severe injury per body region. Outcome was compared using univariate analysis and mortality outcomes were also calculated using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 219 cases in South-West Netherlands and 500 cases in Victoria were analyzed. Further analyses comparing the major trauma centres in each region, showed the percentage of bicycle-related death was higher in the Dutch population than in the Australian (n=45 (24%) vs n=13(7%); P<0.001). After adjusting for age, mechanism of injury, GCS and head injury severity in both hospitals, there was no significant difference in mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.4; 95% confidence interval=0.6, 3.5). Patients in Netherlands trauma centre suffered from more serious head injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale>/=3) than patients in the Australian trauma centre (n=165 (88.2%) vs n=121 (62.4%); P<0.001). The other body regions demonstrated significant differences in the AIS scores with significantly more serious injuries (AIS>/=3) of the chest, abdominal and extremities regions in the Australian group. CONCLUSION: Bicycle related major trauma admissions in the Netherlands trauma centre, and in South-West Netherlands had a higher mortality rate associated with a higher percentage of serious head injuries compared with that in the Australian trauma centre and the State of Victoria.", "BACKGROUND: The Denver and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores have been used widely to describe the epidemiology of postinjury multiple-organ failure; however, differences in these scores make it difficult to compare incidence, duration, and mortality of multiple-organ failure. The study aim was to compare the performance of the Denver and SOFA scores with respect to the outcomes of mortality, intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS), and ventilator days. METHODS: A 60-month prospective epidemiologic study was undertaken at an Australian Level I trauma center. Data were collected on trauma patients that met inclusion criteria (ICU admission, Injury Severity Score [ISS] > 15, age > 18 years, head Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] score < 3, survival for >48 hours). Demographics, ISS, physiologic parameters, SOFA and Denver scores, and outcome data were prospectively collected. Sensitivity/specificity and receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated for both scores. Analysis was also completed for a Day 3 postinjury SOFA and Denver score. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients met the inclusion criteria (mean [SD] age, 47 [21] years; ISS, 30; male, 69%; mortality rate, 6%; mean [SD] ICU LOS, 9 [7] days; mean [SD] ventilation period, 6 [7] days). There was no difference in the score performance predicting mortality. Day 3 SOFA score of 4 or greater outperformed the Denver score of greater than 3 when predicting ICU LOS and ventilator days (area under the curve, 0.83 vs. 0.69, 0.86 vs. 0.73, respectively). The SOFA score was more sensitive and the Denver score was more specific when predicting mortality, ICU LOS, and ventilator days. CONCLUSION: Both scores had similar performance predicting mortality; however, the Day 3 SOFA score outperforms the Denver score when predicting ICU LOS and ventilator days. Either score could be superior based on whether one is seeking to optimize specificity or sensitivity. It is important to note that these findings are in a non-head-injured population and that there are practical difficulties using the SOFA in head-injured patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic study, level II."]}
{"question": "Are home sampling kits for sexually transmitted infections acceptable among men who have sex with men?", "retrieved_passages": ["The increasing prevalence of sexually transmitted infection (STI) and delays in access to sexual health care among men who have sex with men are a major public health concern in the UK. This qualitative study, involving semi-structured interviews with 24 men recruited from a genitourinary medicine clinic in Brighton, UK, explored their views towards the introduction of home sampling kits for STI into clinical practice. Participants had previously self-sampled for rectal and oropharyngeal specimens and completed a survey on the acceptability of self-sampling. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using a framework approach. Participants preferred to access home sampling kits from medical venues rather than gay social venues due to privacy concerns and fear of being ridiculed by peers. Perceived societal homophobia led to skepticism towards accessing home sampling kits in commercial venues. Assurance about specimen delivery and receiving test results from clinics was important. Views about using home sampling kits for HIV testing were mixed. Home sampling kits were viewed as an adjunct to clinics, but clinic attendance was preferred if symptomatic. Home sampling kits could be a viable alternative to meet the increasing demand for sexual health services, but to improve the home sampling kit uptake the method of service provision must be culturally sensitive and acceptable.", "OBJECTIVE: There is an urgent need to increase opportunistic screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in community settings, particularly for those who are at increased risk including men who have sex with men (MSM). The aim of this qualitative study was to explore whether home sampling kits (HSK) for multiple bacterial STIs are potentially acceptable among MSM and to identify any concerns regarding their use. This study was developed as part of a formative evaluation of HSKs. METHODS: Focus groups and one-to-one semi-structured interviews with MSM were conducted. Focus group participants (n = 20) were shown a variety of self-sampling materials and asked to discuss them. Individual interviewees (n = 24) had experience of the self-sampling techniques as part of a pilot clinical study. All data were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS: The concept of a HSK was generally viewed as positive, with many benefits identified relating to increased access to testing, enhanced personal comfort and empowerment. Concerns about the accuracy of the test, delays in receiving the results, the possible lack of support and potential negative impact on 'others' were raised. CONCLUSION: The widespread acceptability of using HSKs for the diagnosis of STIs could have important public health impacts in terms of earlier diagnosis of asymptomatic infections and thus a decrease in the rate of onward transmission. In addition, HSKs could potentially optimize the use of genitourinary medicine services and facilitate patient choice.", "BACKGROUND: Not all men who have sex with men (MSM) at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection currently receive sexual healthcare. To increase the coverage of high-quality HIV/STI care for MSM, we developed a home-care programme, as extended STI clinic care. This programme included home sampling for testing, combined with treatment and sexual health counselling. Here, we pilot implemented the programme in a hospital setting (HIV-positive MSM) to determine the factors for the successful implementation of STI home sampling strategies. METHODS: Healthcare providers from the HIV hospital treatment centre (Maastricht) were invited to offer free STI sampling kits (syphilis, hepatitis B, [extra]genital chlamydia and gonorrhoea laboratory testing) to their HIV-positive MSM patients (March to May 2018). To evaluate implementation of the program, quantitative and qualitative data were collected to assess adoption (HIV care providers offered sampling kits to MSM), participation (MSM accepted the sampling kits) and sampling-kit return, STI diagnoses, and implementation experiences. RESULTS: Adoption was 85.3% (110/129), participation was 58.2% (64/110), and sampling-kit return was 43.8% (28/64). Of the tested MSM, 64.3% (18/28) did not recently (< 3 months) undergo a STI test; during the programme, 17.9% (5/28) were diagnosed with an STI. Of tested MSM, 64.3% (18/28) was vaccinated against hepatitis B. MSM reported that the sampling kits were easily and conveniently used. Care providers (hospital and STI clinic) considered the programme acceptable and feasible, with some logistical challenges. All (100%) self-taken chlamydia and gonorrhoea samples were adequate for testing, and 82.1% (23/28) of MSM provided sufficient self-taken blood samples for syphilis screening. However, full syphilis diagnostic work-up required for MSM with a history of syphilis (18/28) was not possible in 44.4% (8/18) of MSM because of insufficient blood sampled. CONCLUSION: The home sampling programme increased STI test uptake and was acceptable and feasible for MSM and their care providers. Return of sampling kits should be further improved. The home-care programme is a promising extension of regular STI care to deliver comprehensive STI care to the home setting for MSM. Yet, in an HIV-positive population, syphilis diagnosis may be challenging when using self-taken blood samples.", "BACKGROUND: Internet-based screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been acceptable to women, and can reach high-risk populations. No prior published data describe internet-based screening for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis in men. We studied whether internet-based screening was acceptable and reached a high-risk population, and what risk factors were associated with STI positivity. METHODS: The website, www.iwantthekit.org, encouraged men >/=14 years of age to request a home self-sampling kit and a questionnaire on risk factors and acceptability of internet-based screening. Penile swabs and urine samples were tested for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. vaginalis using a nucleic acid amplification test. Risk factors and acceptability were examined using chi squared tests and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 501 samples received for testing, 106 (21%) were positive for at least one STI, 64 (13%) for chlamydia, 4 (1%) for gonorrhea, and 49 (10%) for trichomonas. In multivariable analyses, age, race, household income, and frequency of condom use were independently associated with infection with at least one STI. Of the total respondents, 34% had a prior STI; 29% reported having a partner with an STI, but only 13% reported always using a condom. Among the men who participated in this study, 77% preferred a self-administered specimen versus attending a clinic, 89% reported that swab use was easy, and 89% reported that they would use internet-based screening again. CONCLUSIONS: Men who accessed internet-based screening had known risk factors for STIs and had a high prevalence of infection. Internet-based screening was acceptable and could reach these high-risk men who might not otherwise be reached through traditional means.", "CONTEXT: STDs are common among older adolescents and young adults; hence, STD screening is a public health priority. Home-based STD testing could be a strategy to improve screening rates, particularly among at-risk populations, including sexual minority (i.e., nonheterosexual) young adults. METHODS: Data were collected from a national sample of 971 sexual minority young adults aged 18-26 through an online survey in the fall of 2013. Logistic regression analyses identified associations between respondents' characteristics and their willingness to use a home-based test for chlamydia and gonorrhea. RESULTS: A greater proportion of men than of women were willing to use a home-based STD test (81% vs. 68%). Willingness was more likely among gay than among bisexual men, among men insured through their parents than among the uninsured and among those who had had two or more sexual partners in the past year than among those who had had fewer (adjusted odds ratios, 2.0-2.2). Among men, students were less likely than the employed to report willingness for home-based testing (0.4). Among women, willingness was more likely among those who reported at least two partners in the past year than among those who reported fewer (1.6). Overall, respondents' most common concerns about home-based STD testing regarded test accuracy, their ability to do the test correctly and their preference to see a doctor for testing. CONCLUSIONS: Home-based STD testing may be a promising strategy for screening sexual minority young adults; understanding correlates of willingness and young adults' concerns may help inform self-testing programs."]}
{"question": "Surgical management of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta: is endoaortic balloon occlusion safe?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Occlusion of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta by an endoaortic inflatable balloon has been proposed as an alternative to conventional cross-clamping to prevent injury to the vessel and distal embolization of debris. The safety and the effectiveness of endoaortic occlusion have not been documented in this setting. METHODS: Endoaortic occlusion was employed in 52 of 2,172 consecutive patients. Surgeon's choice was based on preoperative identification of aortic calcifications or intraoperative epiaortic ultrasonographic scanning. Deaths and strokes were analyzed casewise and in aggregate. RESULTS: In 10 patients (19.2%), the endoaortic balloon had to be replaced by the ordinary cross-clamp because of incomplete occlusion (n = 5), hindered exposure (n = 2), or balloon rupture (n = 3). In-hospital death occurred in 13 patients (25%), and stroke on awakening from anesthesia in 2 (3.8%). The death rate of patients treated by endoaortic occlusion was significantly higher compared with all other patients (4.2%, p < 0.0001) and with the expected estimate by European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (10.5%, p = 0.05). By multivariable analysis, use of endoaortic occlusion was independently associated with in-hospital death (odds ratio = 5.609, 95% confidence interval: 2.684 to 11.719). Although the stroke rate was higher in the endoaortic occlusion group compared with all other patients, the difference was only possibly significant (3.8% versus 0.8%, p = 0.067). CONCLUSIONS: In this series, the endoaortic occlusion was frequently ineffective, and was associated with a significantly higher risk of in-hospital death and a numerically higher risk of stroke."]}
{"question": "Estradiol and Antagonist Pretreatment Prior to Microdose Leuprolide in in Vitro Fertilization. Does It Improve IVF Outcomes in Poor Responders as Compared to Oral Contraceptive Pill?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To compare in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in low responders stimulated with microdose leuprolide protocol (ML) following pretreatment with either oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or luteal estradiol (E2) + GnRH antagonist (E2 + antag) for follicular synchronization prior to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of 130 women, who were poor responders, undergoing IVF with either OCP/ML or E2+ antag/ML protocols. The main outcome measures were ongoing pregnancy rates, number of oocytes retrieved, and cancellation rate. RESULTS: Both groups were similar in baseline characteristics. There were no significant differences in gonadotropin requirement, cancellation rate, and number of embryos transferred. Ongoing pregnancy rates (40% vs. 15%) were significantly higher in the OCP/ML group. Trends toward greater number of oocytes retrieved (7.7 +/- 3.4 vs. 5.9 +/- 4.2) and improved implantation rates (20% vs. 12%) were also noted, but these did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: E2+antag pretreatment does not appear to improve IVF outcomes in ML protocol when compared to the standard OCP in poor responders. Randomized trials with adequate power to study the optimal method of steroid pretreatments appear justified."]}
{"question": "Are opioid dependence and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) documented in the medical record?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Opioid-dependent patients often have co-occurring chronic illnesses requiring medications that interact with methadone. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is typically provided separately from medical care. Hence, coordination of medical care and substance use treatment is important to preserve patient safety. OBJECTIVE: To identify potential safety risks among MMT patients engaged in medical care by evaluating the frequency that opioid dependence and MMT documentation are missing in medical records and characterizing potential medication-methadone interactions. METHODS: Among patients from a methadone clinic who received primary care from an affiliated, but separate, medical center, we reviewed electronic medical records for documentation of methadone, opioid dependence, and potential drug-methadone interactions. The proportions of medical records without opioid dependence and methadone documentation were estimated and potential medication-methadone interactions were identified. RESULTS: Among the study subjects (n = 84), opioid dependence documentation was missing from the medical record in 30% (95% CI, 20%-41%) and MMT documentation was missing from either the last primary care note or the last hospital discharge summary in 11% (95% CI, 5%-19%). Sixty-nine percent of the study subjects had at least 1 medication that potentially interacted with methadone; 19% had 3 or more potentially interacting medications. CONCLUSION: Among patients receiving MMT and medical care at different sites, documentation of opioid dependence and MMT in the medical record occurs for the majority, but is missing in a substantial number of patients. Most of these patients are prescribed medications that potentially interact with methadone. This study highlights opportunities for improved coordination between medical care and MMT.", "BACKGROUND: Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) reduces the harms of opioid use disorder and is being rapidly scaled-up in China. This study evaluated the real-world implementation of MMT system in Wuhan, China. METHODS: Data extracted from electronic medical records collected in 2010 on 8811 patients were used to compute for each patient indices of the prescribed and consumed daily methadone doses, an adherence index, dose adjustments following missed doses, the rates of opiate positive urine tests, self-reported drug use, injection drug use (IDU), and the duration of MMT exposure. FINDINGS: The modal daily doses prescribed were 60 mg and above for 68.5% of patients. Adherence was variable: 51% of patients attended less than 60% and 26% attended 80-100% of their treatment days; and patients with long MMT exposure had significantly higher adherence rates than patients with short MMT exposure. The differences between doses dispensed immediately before and after the interruption in dosing days ranged from 0 to 7 mg, independently of the length of the interruption or the prescribed dosing level. The overall rate of opiate positive tests was 20%; 45% of patients had at least one opiate positive test; 29% reported past month drug use and 53% of them reported past month IDU. Adherence and MMT exposure duration correlated significantly with the proportion of opiate negative urine tests (r=0.355, p<0.001; r=0.351, p<0.001, respectively). Treatment for males and females was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of safe methadone dosing after absences and improving daily attendance are identified as priority improvement areas.", "AIM: To examine the frequency and severity of low bone mineral density (BMD) among patients enrolled in a methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program and to ascertain risk factors for low BMD in this population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. MEASUREMENTS: Data derived from standardized survey, medical record review, and dual energy X-ray densitometry (DXA). RESULTS: DXA results were below normal in 83% (76/92) of the study sample with T-scores < -2.5 (osteoporosis range) in 35% [32/92] and between -1.0 and -2.5 (osteopenia range) in 48% [44/92]. Risk factors for low BMD were common: tobacco use, 91%; heavy alcohol use, 52%; and HIV infection, 28%. Only 17% (16/92) were on medications that lower the risk of osteoporosis: estrogen (n = 5), testosterone (n = 4), calcium (n = 4), and Vitamin D (n = 2). None of the participants reported a known diagnosis of osteoporosis. In bivariate analyses, significant predictors of low BMD were: male gender (p < 0.001), lower weight (p = 0.009), and heavy alcohol use (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: More than three quarters of this sample of patients in a MMT program had low BMD. Treatable conditions associated with low BMD were commonplace. Efforts to increase awareness of low BMD in MMT patients should be considered so that effective treatment may be employed to lower future fracture risk.", "BACKGROUND: Multiple substance use is a common problem among heroin users. This study aims to describe patterns of multiple substance use one year before and during attendance at methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) programs and associated variables of continued heroin use in MMT clinics in Yunnan, China. METHODS: The study was conducted among 168 heroin addicts who had received treatment for at least one year at two MMT clinics in Kunming city. A structured questionnaire, a medical record, and computer database were used to obtain history of substances use, significant clinical information, and treatment details, respectively. RESULTS: Heroin, tobacco, and alcohol were the most commonly used substances both before and during MMT. After one year in MMT, use of heroin, alcohol, tramadol, and triazolam significantly decreased whereas use of ephedrine increased. Simultaneous substance use was halved but the decrease was not statistically significant. The proportion of injecting users was reduced from 61% to 43%. History of heroin use in the preceding 6 months during MMT increased the odds of continued heroin use (OR=5.8, 95% CI=[2.9-11.3]). An average 10mg higher methadone dose increment was associated with a reduced odds of heroin use by 10%. CONCLUSION: MMT did not reduce the number of substances used, but the number of injecting heroin users after the first year of treatment decreased. Heroin use in the preceding 6 months during MMT treatment and lower methadone dose were associated with continued heroin use in MMT.", "OBJECTIVES: Among patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) for opioid dependence, receipt of unobserved dosing privileges (take homes) and adequate doses (ie, >/= 80 mg) are each associated with improved addiction treatment outcomes, but the association with acute care hospitalization is unknown. We studied whether take-home dosing and adequate doses (ie, >/=80 mg) were associated with decreased hospital admission among patients in an MMT. METHODS: We reviewed daily electronic medical records of patients enrolled in one MMT program to determine receipt of take-home doses, methadone dose 80 mg or more, and hospital admission date. Nonlinear mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether take-home doses or dose 80 mg or more on a given day were associated with hospital admission on the subsequent day. Covariates in adjusted models included age, sex, race/ethnicity, human immunodeficiency virus status, medical illness, mental illness, and polysubstance use at program admission. RESULTS: Subjects (n = 138) had the following characteristics: mean age 43 years; 52% female; 17% human immunodeficiency virus-infected; 32% medical illness; 40% mental illness; and 52% polysubstance use. During a mean follow-up of 20 months, 42 patients (30%) accounted for 80 hospitalizations. Receipt of take homes was associated with significantly lower odds of a hospital admission (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.62), whereas methadone dose 80 mg or more was not (AOR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.56-1.83). CONCLUSIONS: Among MMT patients, receipt of take homes, but not dose of methadone, was associated with decreased hospital admission. Take-home status may reflect not only patients' improved addiction outcomes but also reduced health care utilization."]}
{"question": "Can teaching medical students to investigate medication errors change their attitudes towards patient safety?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a patient-safety curriculum administered during a paediatric clerkship on medical students' attitudes towards patient safety. METHODS: Medical students viewed an online video introducing them to systems-based analyses of medical errors. Faculty presented an example of a medication administration error and demonstrated use of the Learning From Defects tool to investigate the defect. Student groups identified and then analysed medication errors during their clinical rotation using the Learning From Defects framework to organise and present their findings. Outcomes included patient safety attitudinal changes, as measured by questions derived from the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. RESULTS: 108 students completed the curriculum between July 2008 and July 2009. All student groups (25 total) identified, analysed and presented patient safety concerns. Curriculum effectiveness was demonstrated by significant changes on questionnaire items related to patient safety attitudes. The majority of students felt that the curriculum was relevant to their clinical rotation and should remain part of the clerkship. CONCLUSIONS: An active learning curriculum integrated into a clinical clerkship can change learners' attitudes towards patient safety. Students found the curriculum relevant and recommended its continuation."]}
{"question": "Subclavian steal syndrome: can the blood pressure difference between arms predict the severity of steal?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A side-to-side difference in systolic brachial arterial blood pressure is a common finding in subclavian artery stenosis and is frequently used as a screening tool for subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). It was the goal of this retrospective study to investigate the relationship between different vertebral artery waveform types and the side-to-side difference in systolic blood pressure in patients with sonographically proven SSS. METHODS: The records of 1860 patients from the Neuroultrasound Laboratory between January 2000 and December 2000 were screened for the diagnosis of SSS in the final ultrasound report. In all patients, bilateral brachial arterial blood pressure was measured in a sitting position prior to the ultrasound examination. Vertebral artery waveforms were classified as (1) systolic deceleration, (2) alternating flow, and (3) complete reversal at rest. Blood pressure difference as calculated by normal-side blood pressure minus lesion-side blood pressure was compared with the 3 Doppler waveform types. RESULTS: SSS was found in 51 of 1860 (2.7%) ultrasonography studies of 49 patients (17 men, 32 women; mean age 65.3 +/- 10.5 years). Two patients (4%) had bilateral SSS. In 3 patients (6%), SSS was related to an innominate artery stenosis. Waveform analysis showed a completely reversed flow in 16 (31%), an alternating flow in 24 (47%), and a systolic deceleration in 11 (22%) cases. Systolic blood pressure difference was significantly higher in the complete reversal and alternating groups than in the systolic deceleration group (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena."]}
{"question": "Does a geriatric oncology consultation modify the cancer treatment plan for elderly patients?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: This study was performed to describe the treatment plan modifications after a geriatric oncology clinic. Assessment of health and functional status and cancer assessment was performed in older cancer patients referred to a cancer center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 2004 and May 2005, 105 patients 70 years old or older referred to a geriatric oncology consultation at the Institut Curie cancer center were included. Functional status, nutritional status, mood, mobility, comorbidity, medication, social support, and place of residence were assessed. Oncology data and treatment decisions were recorded before and after this consultation. Data were analyzed for a possible correlation between one domain of the assessment and modification of the treatment plan. RESULTS: Patient characteristics included a median age of 79 years and a predominance of women with breast cancer. About one half of patients had an independent functional status. Nearly 15% presented severe undernourishment. Depression was suspected in 53.1% of cases. One third of these patients had >2 chronic diseases, and 74% of patients took > or =3 medications. Of the 93 patients with an initial treatment decision, the treatment plan was modified for 38.7% of cases after this assessment. Only body mass index and the absence of depressive symptoms were associated with a modification of the treatment plan. CONCLUSION: The geriatric oncology consultation led to a modification of the cancer treatment plan in more than one third of cases. Further studies are needed to determine whether these modifications improve the outcome of these older patients.", "AIM: The aim of this systematic review is to summarise all available data on the effect of a geriatric evaluation on the multidisciplinary treatment of older cancer patients, focussing on oncologic treatment decisions and the implementation of non-oncologic interventions. METHODS: A systematic search in MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies on the effect of a geriatric evaluation on oncologic and non-oncologic treatment for older cancer patients. RESULTS: Literature search identified 1654 reports (624 from Medline and 1030 from Embase), of which 10 studies were included in the review. Three studies used a geriatric consultation while seven used a geriatric assessment performed by a cancer specialist, healthcare worker or (research) nurse. Six studies addressed a change in oncologic treatment, the initial treatment plan was modified in a median of 39% of patients after geriatric evaluation, of which two thirds resulted in less intensive treatment. Seven studies focused on the implementation of non-oncologic interventions based on the results of the geriatric evaluation; all but one reported that interventions were suggested for over 70% of patients, even in studies that did not focus specifically on frail older patients. In the other study, implementation of non-oncologic interventions was left to the cancer specialist's discretion. CONCLUSION: A geriatric evaluation has significant impact on oncologic and non-oncologic treatment decisions in older cancer patients and deserves consideration in the oncologic work-up for these patients.", "BACKGROUND: The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is the gold standard in geriatric oncology to identify patients at high risk of adverse outcomes and optimize cancer and overall management. Many studies have demonstrated that CGA could modify oncologic treatment decision. However, there is little knowledge on which domains of the CGA are associated with this change. Moreover, the impact of frailty and physical performance on change in cancer treatment plan has been rarely assessed. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of older patients with solid or hematologic cancer referred by oncologists for a geriatric evaluation before cancer treatment. A comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed by a multidisciplinary team to provide guidance for treatment decision. We performed a multivariate analysis to identify CGA domains associated with change in cancer treatment plan. RESULTS: Four hundred eighteen patients, mean age 82.8 +/- 5.5, were included between October 2011 and January 2016, and 384 of them were referred with an initial cancer treatment plan. This initial cancer treatment plan was changed in 64 patients (16.7%). In multivariate analysis, CGA domains associated with change in cancer treatment plan were cognitive impairment according to the MMSE score (p = 0.020), malnutrition according to the MNA score (p = 0.023), and low physical performance according to the Short Physical Performance Battery (p = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Cognition, malnutrition and low physical performance are significantly associated with change in cancer treatment plan in older adults with cancer. More studies are needed to evaluate their association with survival, treatment toxicity and quality of life. The role of physical performance should be specifically explored.", "OBJECTIVE: Big Data is widely seen as a major opportunity for progress in the practice of personalized medicine, attracting the attention from medical societies and presidential teams alike as it offers a unique opportunity to enlarge the base of evidence, especially for older patients underrepresented in clinical trials. This study prospectively assessed the real-time availability of clinical cases in the Health & Research Informatics Total Cancer Care (TCC) database matching community patients with cancer, and the impact of such a consultation on treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged 70 and older seen at the Lynn Cancer Institute (LCI) with a documented malignancy were eligible. Geriatric screening information and the oncologist's pre-consultation treatment plan were sent to Moffitt. A search for similar patients was done in TCC and additional information retrieved from Electronic Medical Records. A report summarizing the data was sent and the utility of such a consultation was assessed per email after the treatment decision. RESULTS: Thirty one patients were included. The geriatric screening was positive in 87.1% (27) of them. The oncogeriatric consultation took on average 2.2 working days. It influenced treatment in 38.7% (12), and modified it in 19.4% (6). The consultation was perceived as \"somewhat\" to \"very useful\" in 83.9% (26). CONCLUSION: This study establishes a proof of concept of the feasibility of real time use of Big Data for clinical practice. The geriatric screening and the consultation report influenced treatment in 38.7% of cases and modified it in 19.4%, which compares very well with oncogeriatric literature. Additional steps are needed to render it financially and clinically viable."]}
{"question": "Does left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion device alter the echocardiography and electrocardiogram parameters in patients with atrial fibrillation?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: The alterations of echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients received left atrial appendage LAA occlusion therapy are still unclear. The present study was to evaluate the influence of LAA occlusion device on echocardiography and ECG changes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: Seventy-three patients who had undergone Watchman, LAmbre and Lefort were enrolled in this study. Echocardiography and ECG results at pre- and post-operation were collected. Besides, echocardiography was also performed during follow-up visits at 1, 6 and 12months after discharge. RESULTS: After LAA occlusion, a slight and measureable movement of QRS electric axis was observed in most patients. The significant differences were also observed in heart rate (HR) and the mean-mean QT interval between pre- and post-operation for all patients. There existed no significant difference in echocardiographic parameters between before and after device implantation. However, a larger left atrial (LA) diameter was detected by echocardiography during follow-up visit at 6months when compared with pre-operation parameters. Similarly, aortic root diameter (ARD) was also larger during follow-up at 12months than the baseline dimension in pre-operation. CONCLUSIONS: LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation."]}
{"question": "Is the breast best for children with a family history of atopy?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported that breast-feeding protects children against a variety of diseases, but these studies were generally conducted on \"high-risk\" or hospitalized children. This paper describes the results of our study on the effects of breast-feeding on rate of illness in normal children with a family history of atopy. METHODS: A historic cohort approach of 794 children with a family history of atopy was used to assess the effects of breast-feeding on illness rates. Family history of atopy was based on allergic diseases in family members as registered by the family physician. Illness data from birth onwards were available from the Continuous Morbidity Registration of the Department of Family Medicine. Information on breast-feeding was collected by postal questionnaire. We then compared rates of illness between children with a family history of atopy who were and who were not breast-fed. RESULTS: Breast-feeding was related to lower levels of childhood illness both in the first and the first three years of life. In the first year of life they had fewer episodes of gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infections, and digestive tract disorders. Over the next three years of life they had fewer respiratory tract infections and skin infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy."]}
{"question": "Does escalation of the apical dose change treatment outcome in beta-radiation of posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques?", "retrieved_passages": ["PURPOSE: To show the results of treating posterior uveal melanomas with 106Ru plaque beta-ray radiotherapy and to review and discuss the literature concerning the optimal apical dose prescription (100 vs. 160 Gy). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-eight patients with uveal melanomas (median height 3.85 mm + 1 mm sclera) were treated with ruthenium plaques. The median apical dose was 120 Gy, the median scleral dose 546 Gy. RESULTS: After 5.8 years of follow-up, the overall 5-year survival rate was 90%, the disease specific 5-year survival rate was 92% (3 patients alive with metastasis). Six percent received a second ruthenium application, 10% of the eyes had to be enucleated. Local control was achieved in 90% of the patients with conservative therapy alone. Central or paracentral tumors showed 50% of the pretherapeutic vision after 4 years, and 80% of the vision was preserved in those with peripheral tumors. The main side effects were mostly an uncomplicated retinopathy (30%); macular degeneration or scarring led to poor central vision in 30% of cases. CONCLUSION: Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed."]}
{"question": "Does septoplasty change the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To measure the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate in patients with nasal septal deviation, before and after septoplasty. METHODS: The mucosal and bony structures of the middle turbinate and the angle of the septum were measured using radiological analysis before septoplasty and at least one year after septoplasty. All pre- and post-operative measurements of the middle turbinate were compared using the paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. RESULTS: The dimensions of bony and mucosal components of the middle turbinate on concave and convex sides of the septum were not significantly changed by septoplasty. There was a significant negative correlation after septoplasty between the angle of the septum and the middle turbinate total area on the deviated side (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: The present study findings suggest that compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate is not affected by septoplasty, even after one year.", "OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine the dimensions of the compensatory hypertrophic inferior turbinate and investigate the radiological changes in the morphology of the conchal bone in patients with septal deviation. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review. METHODS: The mucosal and bone compartments of the hypertrophic turbinate were measured using computed tomography (CT) in patients with septal deviation, and the conchal bones were classified radiologically as lamellar, compact, and combined types. The results were compared with those of controls. RESULTS: The dimensions of the bony and mucosal components of the inferior turbinate were significantly greater than those of controls in the anterior and middle segments, while the morphological changes in the conchal bone were not different. CONCLUSION: The significant bony and mucosal enlargement in the anterior and middle segments of the inferior turbinate supports turbinate reduction at the time of septoplasty and the CT findings should be considered when making a decision about the reduction type.", "OBJECTIVE: To measure the dimensions, composition, and possible structural and/or histopathological changes of the compensatory hypertrophic inferior turbinate in patients with deviated nasal septum. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized, and morphometric study. METHODS: Nineteen patients with deviated nasal septum and compensatory hypertrophy of the inferior turbinate in the contralateral nasal cavity underwent surgery for correction of nasal obstruction. Patients' specimens were compared with those of a control group consisting of 10 inferior turbinates removed at autopsy. Quantitative measurements of the inferior turbinate histological sections were carried out and included the width of the layers and morphometric calculations of the relative proportions of the soft tissue constituents. Also, qualitative study was performed to detect pathological changes. RESULTS: Of all layers, the inferior turbinate bone underwent a twofold increase in thickness and manifested the most significant expansion (P < or =.001), whereas the contribution of the mucosal layers to the inferior turbinate hypertrophy was modest. The morphometric analysis revealed a larger proportion of venous sinusoids in hypertrophic turbinates, but the difference was small and statistically insignificant. Qualitative assessment disclosed normal mucosal architecture in all inferior turbinates with compensatory hypertrophy. Eleven remained intact, while eight disclosed mild to moderate pathological changes. CONCLUSIONS: The data gathered in the present study are of importance to the decision-making process regarding turbinate surgery. The significant bone expansion and the relative minor role played by the mucosal hypertrophy would support the decision to excise the inferior turbinate bone at the time of septoplasty.", "In patients with septal deviation, compensatory inferior turbinate hypertrophy in the side of the nose opposite the major septal deviation is often found. Although turbinectomy in connection with septoplasty is a relatively common clinical procedure, the effectiveness of the procedure is unknown, and the indications and technique applied vary considerably. Fifty patients with nasal obstruction and anterior septal deviations responded to a questionnaire 5 years after operation. Thirty-seven of these patients were available for objective examinations and acoustic rhinometry. In connection with their operations patients had been randomized into two groups. Septoplasty was performed in one group, while the other had a septoplasty supplemented with an anterior inferior turbinoplasty performed on the side opposite the major septal deviation. The subjective overall evaluation was not influenced by turbinoplasty, and no changes in the frequency of crusting were found. In all, 24% of the patients were dissatisfied with the results of surgery, and only 43% were completely satisfied with final results. No influence of turbinate reduction was detectable. Acoustic rhinometry also showed, that there was still a marked difference between the dimensions of the two sides of the nose, and that postoperative spatial conditions were still decreased on both sides when compared with normal controls."]}
{"question": "Does prior benign prostate biopsy predict outcome for patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of prior benign prostate biopsies on the surgical and clinical outcomes of patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy for prostate cancer. METHODS: A total of 1369 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon between 1991 and 2001. A subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had undergone at least one prior benign prostate biopsy for a rising prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, constituted our study population. A total of 1115 patients with no prior biopsy represented our control group. After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater. RESULTS: Patients with a prior benign biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% versus 64%; P <0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had eventual evidence of biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that patients with prior benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or greater; P <0.01). Overall, patients in the study group had lower probability (odds ratio 0.57, P <0.001) of biochemical failure compared with those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings."]}
{"question": "Does patient position during liver surgery influence the risk of venous air embolism?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: It is generally believed that positioning of the patient in a head-down tilt (Trendelenberg position) decreases the likelihood of a venous air embolism during liver resection. METHODS: The physiological effect of variation in horizontal attitude on central and hepatic venous pressure was measured in 10 patients during liver surgery. Hemodynamic indices were recorded with the operating table in the horizontal, 20 degrees head-up and 20 degrees head-down positions. RESULTS: There was no demonstrable pressure gradient between the hepatic and central venous levels in any of the positions. The absolute pressures did, however, vary in a predictable way, being highest in the head-down and lowest during head-up tilt. However, on no occasion was a negative intraluminal pressure recorded. CONCLUSION: The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism."]}
{"question": "Do Indigenous Australians age prematurely?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: To assess whether Indigenous Australians age prematurely compared with other Australians, as implied by Australian Government aged care policy, which uses age 50 years and over for population-based planning for Indigenous people compared with 70 years for non-indigenous people. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of aged care assessment, hospital and health survey data comparing Indigenous and non-indigenous age-specific prevalence of health conditions. Analysis of life tables for Indigenous and non-indigenous populations comparing life expectancy at different ages. RESULTS: At age 63 for women and age 65 for men, Indigenous people had the same life expectancy as non-indigenous people at age 70. There is no consistent pattern of a 20-year lead in age-specific prevalence of age-associated conditions for Indigenous compared with other Australians. There is high prevalence from middle-age onwards of some conditions, particularly diabetes (type unspecified), but there is little or no lead for others. CONCLUSION: The idea that Indigenous people age prematurely is not well supported by this study of a series of discrete conditions. The current focus and type of services provided by the aged care sector may not be the best way to respond to the excessive burden of chronic disease and disability of middle-aged Indigenous people.", "BACKGROUND: The high frequency of premature death from cardiovascular disease in indigenous Australians is often attributed to the high prevalence of risk factors, especially type II diabetes mellitus (DM). We evaluated the relationship of ethnicity to atherosclerotic burden, as evidenced by carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), independent of risk factor status. METHODS: We studied 227 subjects (147 men; 50 +/- 13 y): 119 indigenous subjects with (IDM, n = 54), and without DM (InDM, n = 65), 108 Caucasian subjects with (CDM, n = 52), and without DM (CnDM, n = 56). IMT was measured according to standard methods and compared with clinical data and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: In subjects both with and without DM, IMT was significantly greater in indigenous subjects. There were no significant differences in gender, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between any of the groups, and subjects with DM showed no difference in plasma HbA1c. Cardiovascular risk factors were significantly more prevalent in indigenous subjects. Nonetheless, ethnicity (beta = -0.34; p < 0.0001), age (beta = 0.48; p < 0.0001), and smoking (beta = 0.13; p < 0.007) were independent predictors of IMT in multiple linear regression models. CONCLUSION: Ethnicity appears to be an independent correlate of preclinical cardiovascular disease, even after correction for the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in indigenous Australians. Standard approaches to control currently known risk factors are vital to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease, but in themselves may be insufficient to fully address the high prevalence in this population.", "OBJECTIVE: Indigenous Australians have rates of cardiovascular (CVD) mortality some seven to 10-fold higher than non-Indigenous Australians aged 25-64 years. We aimed to evaluate the impact of type 2 diabetes and components of the metabolic syndrome on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) as a marker of cardiovascular risk in Indigenous Australians living in remote and urban environments and in Australians of European ancestry. DESIGN, PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: CIMT was measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound imaging of the common carotid artery in 119 remote Indigenous, 144 urban Indigenous and 122 urban European Australians with and without diabetes. RESULTS: In nondiabetic participants, CIMT was lowest in Europeans (mean (SD) 0.64 mm (0.10)), higher in urban Indigenous Australians (0.67 mm (0.12)) and highest in remote Indigenous Australians (0.73 mm (0.15), P < 0.001). CIMT was higher with diabetes with the same pattern observed between populations: 0.73 mm, 0.79 mm and 0.82 mm, respectively (P < 0.001). Traditional risk factors (age, male gender, blood pressure and HbA1c) explained 35-45% of the variance of CIMT within each population group. However, differences in CIMT between population groups were maintained after adjustment for these cardiovascular risks plus cholesterol and smoking (P < 0.001). Factor analysis revealed that variables of the metabolic syndrome, together with smoking and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), are likely to explain the higher CIMT in Indigenous Australians (and the urban-remote gradient). Unmeasured variables (genetic, psychosocial and socioeconomic) may also contribute to higher CIMT in these populations. CONCLUSION: Glycaemic control and metabolic syndrome components contribute significantly to premature atherogenesis in Indigenous Australians and we recommend that therapy should be targeted accordingly.", "OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe mortality in a cohort of remote-living Aboriginal Australians using electronic record linkage. METHODS: Between 2004 and 2006, 363 Aboriginal people living in remote Western Australia (WA) completed a questionnaire assessing medical history and behavioural risk factors. We obtained mortality records for the cohort from the WA Data Linkage System and compared them to data for the general population. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to identify predictors of mortality over a 9-year follow-up period. RESULTS: The leading causes of mortality were diabetes, renal failure, and ischaemic heart disease. Diabetes and renal failure accounted for 28% of all deaths. This differed from both the Australian population as a whole, and the general Indigenous Australian population. The presence of chronic disease did not predict mortality, nor did behaviours such as smoking. Only age, male sex, poor mobility, and cognitive impairment were risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce premature mortality, public health practitioners should prioritise the prevention and treatment of diabetes and renal disease in Aboriginal people in remote WA. This will require a sustained and holistic approach.", "BACKGROUND: The health status of Indigenous populations of Australia and New Zealand (NZ) Maori manifests as life expectancies substantially lower than the total population. Accurate assessment of time trends in mortality and life expectancy allows evaluation of progress in reduction of health inequalities compared to the national or non-Indigenous population. METHODS: Age-specific mortality and life expectancy (at birth) (LE) for Indigenous populations (Australia from 1990 and NZ from 1950); and all Australia and non-Maori NZ (from 1890), males (M) and females (F), were obtained from published sources and national statistical agency reports. Period trends were assessed for credible estimates of Indigenous LE, and the LE gap compared to the total population for Australia, and non-Maori for NZ. Period trends in premature adult mortality, as cumulative probability of dying over 15-59 years, were assessed similarly. The relative contribution of differences in age-specific mortality to the LE gap between Indigenous and the all-Australia population, and the non-Maori NZ, was estimated for each country by sex for the most recent period: 2010-2012 for Australia, 2012-2014 for NZ. RESULTS: LE increased for all populations, although LE gaps between Indigenous and all Australia showed little change over time. LE gaps between NZ Maori and non-Maori increased significantly from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s, and since then have fallen again. Recent LE gaps in Australia (M 12.5; F 12.0 years in 2010-2012) were larger than in NZ (M 7.3; F 6.8 years in 2012-2014). Premature adult mortality (15-59 years) improved for all populations, but mortality ratios show little change since 2000, with Indigenous at 3(1/2)-4 times that of all Australians, and Maori 2-3 times that of non-Maori. Using decomposition analysis, the age interval contributing most strongly to differences in LE between Indigenous and all Australia was 35-59 years, but between Maori and non-Maori it was 60-74 years. CONCLUSION: In Australia and NZ, Indigenous LE and adult mortality are improving in absolute terms, but not relative to the entire or non-Indigenous populations, causing gaps in life expectancy to persist."]}
{"question": "Ultrasound in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis; a useful addition to clinical staging?", "retrieved_passages": ["OBJECTIVE: As part of the staging procedure in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, we assessed the role of ultrasound examination, in particular its role in assessing the extent and the invasion into the corpora. METHODS: From 1988 until 1992, all patients referred for primary treatment underwent ultrasound assessment with a 7.5 MHz linear array small parts transducer as part of the clinical workup. All ultrasound images were reviewed by one radiologist, without knowledge of the clinical outcome and were compared with the results obtained at histopathologic examination. RESULTS: In 16 patients the primary tumor and in 1 patient a recurrent cancer after primary therapy were examined. All tumors were identified as hypoechoic lesions. Ultrasound examination in the region of the glans was not able to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue and invasion into the corpus spongiosum, but absence or presence of invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum was clearly demonstrated. Accurate measurement by ultrasound of maximum tumor thickness was seen in seven of sixteen examinations. CONCLUSIONS: While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra."]}
{"question": "Do oblique views add value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique lumbar spine radiographs are often a standard part of the evaluation of children who are clinically suspected of having spondylolysis. Recent concerns regarding radiation exposure and costs have brought the value of oblique radiographs into question. The purpose of the present study was to determine the diagnostic value of oblique views in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. METHODS: Radiographs of fifty adolescents with L5 spondylolysis without spondylolisthesis and fifty controls were retrospectively reviewed. All controls were confirmed not to have spondylolysis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or bone scanning. Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique radiographs of the lumbar spine were arranged into two sets of slides: one showing four views (anteroposterior, lateral, right oblique, and left oblique) and one showing two views (anteroposterior and lateral only). The slides were randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered. Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement were assessed on the basis of the percentage of overall agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). PCXMC software was used to generate effective radiation doses. Study charges were determined from radiology billing data. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view radiographs in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. The sensitivity was 0.59 for two-view studies and 0.53 for four-view studies (p = 0.33). The specificity was 0.96 for two-view studies and 0.94 for four-view studies (p = 0.60). Inter-rater agreement, intra-rater agreement, and agreement with gold-standard ICC values were in the moderate range and also demonstrated no significant differences. Percent overall agreement was 78% for four-view studies and 82% for two-view studies. The radiation effective dose was 1.26 mSv for four-view studies and 0.72 mSv for two-view studies (difference, 0.54 mSv). The charge for four-view studies was $145 more than that for two-view studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view studies. Although oblique views have long been considered standard practice by some, our data could not identify a diagnostic benefit that might outweigh the additional cost and radiation exposure.", "PURPOSE: Mechanical low back pain is common in the pediatric population; recent studies have shown that undiagnosed mechanical low back pain (UMLBP) is the most common cause of low back pain presenting in adolescents, accounting for up to 78% of cases. Spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis is the most common cause with diagnosed pathology observed in this age group. The goals of this study are to: determine the natural history of low back pain, evaluate the value of radiographic studies in establishing a diagnosis of spondylolysis, and determine the cost and radiation effective doses (EDs) associated with those studies with the associated risks radiation exposure. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients records aged 10 to 19 years who presented to our institution with mechanical low back of undiagnosed etiology from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2008 were identified. Patients with previous back surgery, high-energy trauma, congenital syndromes, or medical comorbidities were excluded. UMLBP was defined as back pain with etiology undetected by examination and imaging. We reviewed the following data: age at presentation, sex, the number of follow-up visits, the total length of follow-up, the type of imaging studies performed, and the results from imaging studies. Age-specific radiation EDs were calculated for 10 to 14.9 years, 15 to 18 years, and adults for plain films, fine cut 2-level L-spine computed tomography (CT) scans, and bone scans (BSs). RESULTS: A total of 2846 patients (63% female) with average age of 14.3 years were identified. A total of 2159 (76%) patients had UMLBP, 61% of that had </=2 follow-up visits. One hundred and ninety-four patients (7.8%) were diagnosed with spondylolysis; 119 (86%) by plain film, 56 (12.5%) by BSs, and 17 (1.5%) by CTs. Most patients (74%) with spondylolysis had a positive plain film study. There was no significant difference between 2-view (anterior-posterior, lateral) and 4-view (anterior-posterior, lateral, right oblique, left oblique) studies in sensitivity (78% vs. 72%, P=0.39). Advanced imaging was pursued in 90/354 (25%) patients with negative plain film studies. The sensitivity of BS for spondylolysis was 84% (73 of 88 BSs were positive). The sensitivity of CT for spondylolysis was 90% (44 of 49 CTs were positive. BSs exposed patients to much more radiation than CTs and plain film studies. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical low back pain is common in adolescents and in most cases is undiagnosed; most require no imaging and </=2 office visits. For spondylolysis, 2-view plain films are often diagnostic and oblique views did not add significant value. Advanced imaging increases diagnostic accuracy, but adds to the cost and considerable radiation exposure. Because diagnosis of spondylolysis rarely changes clinical management, physicians should use ionizing radiation studies sparingly in children."]}
{"question": "Are many colorectal cancers due to missed adenomas?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: An unknown number of colorectal cancers could be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopy. Data in the literature are sparse. A large cross-sectional study was done in a prospective database of all patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. METHODS: All consecutive endoscopies over a period of 15 years, in which colorectal cancer was diagnosed were included. All patients who underwent more than one endoscopy and in whom ultimately cancer was diagnosed were studied separately. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 835 patients. Twenty-five patients underwent a previous endoscopy without a cancer diagnosis. These 25 patients were divided into three groups according to the time between the endoscopy in which the cancer was detected and the previous endoscopy. Five out of these 25 patients underwent regular surveillance. Only 11 patients had no argument for regular follow-up. Assuming that these cancers developed from an adenoma than only 11 out of 835 (1.3%) cancers were missed in the adenoma phase. There was no difference in the size of the tumour between the three groups of patients. CONCLUSION: In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.", "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and this has led to an increased use of screening colonoscopy. This screening has resulted in long-term risk reduction in asymptomatic individuals. However, endoscopists may fail to detect advanced adenomas or colon cancer during screening. The reasons that adenomas or cancers are missed are thought to be associated with the location of the lesions or the skills of the endoscopist. To address the limitations of white light endoscopy (WLE) for adenoma detection, advanced endoscopic images have recently been used. Image-enhanced endoscopies (IEEs), including the use of topical dyes, optical filtering, and ultramagnification, allow for gastrointestinal lesion analysis. Many studies have compared the adenoma detection rate (ADR) obtained by using WLE and IEE, but with different results. IEE can be used to help the endoscopist to improve their ADR in screening colonoscopy. This review examines the possible roles of image-enhanced colonoscopy in CRC screening.", "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is an important cause of death in western countries. Screening methods are based on flexible sigmoidoscopy, a cheap, effective, and less painful procedure, but some important lesions on the right colon can be missed. AIM: Evaluate how many important lesions would be missed if colonoscopy indicated only for patients with distal lesions identified during flexible sigmoidoscopy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All consecutive colonoscopy performed in the Endoscopy Unit of the Gastroenterology Division of Federal University of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil, with polyps and cancer suspicious lesions were reviewed. Patients with a second procedure, inflammatory bowel disease or colonic surgery were excluded. RESULTS: We reviewed 101 patients with 38 possible cancer lesions and 70 polyps. The mean age was 62 years (SD 13.7 years) and 45 were male. Forty five lesions were in the right colon, namely 23 adenomas, 10 adenocarcinomas, 1 lymphoma and 11 benign lesion. Among such lesions, 28 were isolated in the right colon (16 adenomas and 7 adenocarcinomas). CONCLUSION: In our study 23 patients (22.77%) had adenomas or adenocarcinomas isolated in the right colon, that would be missed if flexible sigmoidoscopy was used alone.", "Colonoscopic screening and surveillance have been very effective tools in the fight against colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonoscopy is more than a cancer screening test; it also can prevent CRC by detecting and removing precancerous lesions. Despite this potential, there has been increasing concern about CRCs that occur after a previous colonoscopy and before the next screening/surveillance examination (interval CRCs). The etiology of interval CRC is thought to be caused mostly by missed or incompletely resected lesions on index colonoscopy with some contribution of rapidly progressive new lesions. If this is true, many interval cancers should be preventable by improving colonoscopy technique. There are a variety of strategies to decrease interval CRC rates including use of a split-dosed bowel preparation, optimizing withdrawal technique, ensuring complete polypectomy, and careful pathologic examination of the tissue removed. Furthermore, there should be an increased emphasis on how endoscopists are trained to cultivate high-quality technique throughout their careers. It is important to inform patients that even high-quality colonoscopy is not perfectly sensitive for the detection of advanced neoplasia. Improving colonoscopy quality can decrease interval CRC rates and further decrease CRC incidence and mortality.", "Screening for colorectal neoplasia still is the best method of reducing the mortality due to colorectal cancer, and it is to be hoped that fecal occult blood test programs will expand in the near future and be combined with appropriate endoscopy. There are substantial problems with compliance in large programs with occult blood tests as well as endoscopy. Colonography and DNA testing in feces are not yet suitable for population screening. Diagnostic strategies in symptomatic patients are becoming more selective, in the hope of avoiding many superfluous examinations without increasing the risk of missing cancers. New results have confirmed the preventive effect of long-term aspirin use on adenoma recurrence, but the most cost-effective dosage is not clear; the mechanism of action is also uncertain, but seems to involve cyclooxygenase-2. The risk of adenomas does not appear to be associated with low consumption of folate, but with low intake of fiber. A number of biomarkers have been evaluated in polyp patients, but so far surveillance is still based on endoscopic experience, which is less than optimal. Attempts have been made to restrict the number of surveillance endoscopies and reduce the pathologist's workload. The place of argon plasma coagulation has been clearly defined in connection with piecemeal removal of large sessile adenomas. Advances have been achieved in surgery and radiotherapy for rectal cancer, and acute surgery for colonic cancer with severe obstruction will be less common after the introduction of the metal stent."]}
{"question": "Does desflurane alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: Although desflurane is commonly used to control surgically induced hypertension, its effects on left ventricular (LV) function have not been investigated in this clinical situation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the LV function response to desflurane, when used to control intraoperative hypertension. METHODS: In 50 patients, scheduled for vascular surgery, anesthesia was induced with sufentanil 0.5 microg/kg, midazolam 0.3 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with increments of drugs with controlled ventilation (N2O/O2=60/40%) until the start of surgery. A 5 Mhz transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted after intubation. Pulmonary artery catheter and TEE measurements were obtained after induction (to)(control value), at surgical incision (t1) if it was associated with an increase in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) greater than 140 mmHg (hypertension) and after control of hemodynamic parameters by administration of desflurane (return of systolic arterial pressure to within 20% of the control value) (t2) in a fresh gas flow of 31/ min. RESULTS: Sixteen patients developed hypertension at surgical incision. SAP was controlled by desflurane in all 16 patients. Afterload assessed by systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), end-systolic wall-stress (ESWS) and left-ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) increased with incision until the hypertension returned to post-induction values with mean end-tidal concentration of 5.1+/-0.7% desflurane. No change in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change and left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening was noted when desflurane was added to restore blood pressure. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect."]}
{"question": "Does gestational age misclassification explain the difference in birthweights for Australian aborigines and whites?", "retrieved_passages": ["BACKGROUND: After 34 weeks gestation, summary measures of location for birthweight (e.g means and centiles) increase more slowly for Australian Aborigines than for whites. A similar pattern has been observed for blacks in the US. This study tests whether the reported pattern is due to differential misclassification of gestational age. METHODS: Simulation was used to measure the potential effect of differential misclassification of gestational age. Reported gestational age data were obtained from Queensland Perinatal Data Collection (QPDC). Estimates of the true distributions of gestational age were obtained by assuming various (plausible) types of misclassification and applying these to the reported distributions. Previous studies and data from the QPDC were used to help specify the birthweight distributions used in the simulations. RESULTS: At full term, the parameters of the birthweight distributions were robust to gestational age misclassification. At preterm, the 10th centiles were robust to misclassification. In contrast, the 90th centiles were sensitive to even minor misclassification. Extreme types of misclassification were required to remove the divergence in median birthweights for Aborigines and whites. CONCLUSIONS: Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons."]}
