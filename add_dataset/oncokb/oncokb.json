    "ABL1 (also ABL) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with ubiquitous cellular expression. ABL is located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus and can be activated by growth factor receptors, cellular kinases or DNA damage (PMID: 24421390, 1591775). In response to extrinsic ligand stimulation, ABL signaling regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration (PMID: 7651539, 7512450). ABL has additional cellular roles including regulation of actin polymerization, vascular development, transcription, and T cell maturation (PMID: 24421390). In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), translocations between the ABL and BCR genes result in the driver fusion protein BCR-ABL (PMID: 3460176, 2825022). The BCR-ABL fusion protein is a constitutively activated oncogenic tyrosine kinase that causes ligand-independent activation of signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells (PMID: 3460176, 2825022). The BCR-ABL fusion protein results in loss of auto-inhibition of ABL leading to activation of the kinase (PMID: 8246975). Alternative ABL1 translocations are also observed in myeloid disease (PMID: 9695962). Small molecule inhibitors of BCR-ABL, imatinib and dasatinib, have been developed and are FDA-approved for CML and Ph+ALL (PMID: 11870241, 21931113). Mutations in the ABL kinase domain lead to resistance to these treatments and determine sensitivity to other second-generation inhibitors (PMID: 15256671).",
    "Translocations involving ABL2 are found in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) and gangliogliomas (PMID: 29507076, 29880043, 25098428, 10706884, 27894077, 25207766)",

    "ABL2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is a member of the ABL protein family (PMID: 26645050). ABL2 localizes to actin protrusions and mediates the formation and stabilization of actin filaments in coordination with cortactin (PMID: 30256707). β1 integrins signal via ABL2 pathways to control several cellular processes including neuronal stability, cell adhesion, cell migration, and invasion (PMID: 30256707, 25694433, 23365224). Phosphorylation of ABL2 by receptor tyrosine kinases and SRC family kinases results in ABL2 activation, autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of downstream signaling molecules, such as the transcription factor STAT3 (PMID: 21892207). ABL2 is localized in the cytoplasm and is overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors, resulting in enhanced cellular proliferation, invasion, and metabolic changes (PMID: 26645050). Recurrent ABL2 fusion proteins are found in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemias and gangliogliomas (PMID: 29507076, 29880043, 25098428, 10706884). ABL2 fusions result in increased ABL2-mediated signaling, suggesting that ABL2 functions as an oncogene (PMID: 25207766). ABL-targeted small molecule kinase inhibitors may be efficacious in cancers with ABL2 positive rearrangements (PMID: 29464092, 19451690, 25207766).",
    "ABRAXAS1 truncating mutations can form several forms of C-terminally truncated ABRAXAS1 protein. Mouse modeling of ABRAXAS1 deletion suggested that ABRAXAS1 is necessary for DNA damage repair as ABRAXAS1-deleted mice were more sensitive to ionizing radiation than wildtype mice. ABRAXAS1-deleted mice also exhibited increased tumor incidence and decreased survival suggesting that loss of ABRAXAS1 is oncogenic (PMID: 25066119)",
    "The ABRAXAS1 is a DNA repair protein that mediates recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) for DNA damage checkpoint regulation and DNA damage repair through direct binding to BRCA1. The ABRAXAS1-BRCA1 complex plays an important role in tumor suppression. ABRAXAS1 copy loss and somatic mutations have been observed in multiple human cancers, including endometrial, colon, lung, liver, kidney cancers, and in leukemia, with the highest mutation rate found in endometrial cancer (2.5%) (PMID: 25066119). A novel germ line mutation in Abraxas which abrogates BRCA1-dependent DNA repair function has been identified and shown to increases familial breast cancer susceptibility (PMID: 22357538).",
    "Amplification of ACKR3 typically results in the overexpression of the protein. These mutations have been identified in breast cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 17898181, 24074251)",
    ". In vitro studies with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells overexpressing ACKR3 demonstrate that amplification is activating as measured by increased cell migration and invasion and upregulation of TGF-β1/Smad signaling and Akt phosphorylation compared to wildtype (PMID: 31792315)",
    "ACKR3, also known as CXCR7, encodes for the atypical chemokine scavenger receptor specific for stromal-derived factors CXCL12 and CXCL11 (PMID: 16107333, 16940167). The ACKR3-CXCL12 signaling axis promotes cancer cell survival, migration, adhesion, angiogenesis and metastasis from ERK activation through MAPK signaling (PMID: 16940167, 20018651). As a scavenger receptor, ACKR3 is responsible for creating a CXCL12 gradient and influences cell migration and weakens CXCR4 activity through ACKR-CXCL12 internalization (PMID: 18267076). The oncogenic and tumor suppressive role of ACKR3 is likely tissue-type specific. Overexpression and silencing of ACKR3 in breast cancer and lung cancer cell lines and mouse models demonstrate tumorigenesis and cell survival (PMID: 17898181). In contrast, ACKR3 activation in neuroblastoma and colon cancer cell lines demonstrates suppression of tumor growth, cell growth and migration (PMID: 22916293, 24255072). Amplification of ACKR3 has been identified in various cancers, including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 27572688, 26912435). Downregulation of ACKR3 has been identified in undifferentiated neuroblastoma (PMID: 22916293). Loss of ACKR3 in non-small cell lung cancer cell models has demonstrated attenuation of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance through inhibition of the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway (PMID: 31273063).",
    "ACTG1 truncation mutations can form several forms of C-terminally truncated ACTG1 protein. Knockdown of ACTG1 in the SH-EP neuroblastoma cell line was shown to be oncogenic and inactivating as centrosome amplification was enhanced and prometaphase/metaphase was delayed, resulting in the mitotic inhibitor paclitaxel to induce mitotic arrest of the cancer cells (PMID: 21908715, 26697841)",
    "ACTG1 is a cytoskeletal protein that is a member of the actin family (PMID: 24098136, 19497859, 6420066). Actin proteins comprise cellular filaments and can be classified into three groups: alpha, beta and gamma actin, with ACTG1 functioning as cytoplasmic gamma-actin (PMID: 24098136). ACTG1 is highly expressed in the cytoskeleton of diverse cell types, as well as in the Z-discs and costamere structures of adult striated muscles (PMID: 6420066). ACTG1 monomers are important for a variety of cellular functions including cell motility, muscle contraction, cell signaling, cell junction establishment and maintenance of cell shape (PMID: 24098136). ACTG1, along with ACTB, is highly expressed in dividing cells and is critical for adequate muscle function (PMID: 6420066). Germline mutations in ACTG1 have been identified in patients with hearing loss and in Baraiser-Winter Syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by short stature, ptosis and hearing loss (PMID: 13680526, 14684684, 22366783). Somatic ACTG1 mutations are relatively rare in human cancers; however, a SNP in ACTG1 is associated with extreme toxicity to vincristine, a therapy commonly used to treat childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 25084203). Overexpression of ACTG1 has also been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma with mechanisms related to altered glucose metabolism and cellular proliferation (PMID: 30881024, 30675230).",
    "The ACVR1 R206H mutation is located in the glycine-serine-rich domain of the ACVR1 protein. This mutation has been found as a germline mutation in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) and in diffuse pontine gliomas (DIPG) (PMID: 24705252, 24705254)",
    ". In vitro studies have demonstrated that this mutation is activating as measured by increased downstream signaling and transcription compared to wildtype (PMID: 20463014, 24769718, 24705254, 22977237, 20463014)",

    "ACVR1 (activin receptor type 1), also known as ALK2, is a transmembrane protein with cytosolic serine/threonine kinase activity that participates in signaling of transforming growth factor β (TGF-B) superfamily members. It signals by binding to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and activins and forms a heteromeric complex with other receptors. This complex is composed of two type 1 receptors, which are essential for intracellular signaling, and two type 2 receptors, which are essential for ligand binding. Binding of the ligand to the type 2 receptor stabilizes the complex and results in phosphorylation of type 1 receptors, thus resulting in downstream signaling mediated by the SMAD family of proteins (PMID: 15621726). In normal tissues, signaling through ACVR1 regulates cell survival, differentiation and proliferation. Somatic gain-of-function mutations in ACVR1 are the basis of the autosomal dominant condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive (FOP), which results in heterotopic ossification in humans (PMID: 25337067), and similar mutations are present in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) (PMID: 24769718).",
    "ACVR1B encodes for a serine/threonine kinase activin A type IB receptor that functions as a transducer for activin-like ligands that are growth and differentiation factors (PMID: 30335480). ACVR1B mediates TGF-β pathway activation through phosphorylation of the SMAD proteins (PMID: 15689496, 30335480). Knockdown of ACVR1B in pancreatic cancer cell lines and models induces cellular growth, tumorigenesis and dysregulated TGF-β signaling, suggesting that ACVR1B functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 11248065, 24886203). Inactivating mutations of ACVR1B have been identified in pancreatic cancer and ER-negative breast cancer (PMID: 24886203, 26408346, 8519692).",
    "ADHFE1 amplification results from the gain of extra copies of the ADHFE1 gene on chromosome 8q12.3 and leads to overexpression of protein. These mutations have been identified in breast cancer (PMID: 29202474, 30250890)",
    ". In vitro studies with MCF7, MCF10A and MCF12A cells overexpressing ADHFE1 demonstrate that amplification is activating as measured by increased MYC expression and accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate and mitochondrial ROS leading to cellular dedifferentiation compared to wildtype (PMID: 29202474)",
    "ADHFE1 encodes the hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase enzyme which functions in the oxidation of gamma-hydroxybutyrate to succinic semialdehyde in mammalian tissue (PMID: 16616524). This oxidation reaction is coupled to the reduction of 2-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (PMID: 30250890). The promotion of reductive carboxylation by ADHFE1 supports increased acetyl-CoA synthesis and lipogenesis (PMID: 22106302). As ADHFE1 regulates multiple cellular functions, such as DNA replication and cell cycle control, depending on the tissue, its role in cancer has varied depending on cancer type (PMID: 34179501). MYC-induced overexpression of ADHFE1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes tumorigenesis through the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate and mitochondrial ROS, suggesting that ADHFE1 functions primarily as an oncogene in breast cancer (PMID: 29202474, 30250890). However, silencing of ADHFE1 in colorectal cancer patient-derived xenograft mice models and colorectal cancer cell lines increases tumor growth and cell proliferation (PMID: 31632063). Hypermethylation of ADHFE1 has been identified in various different types of cancer, including breast cancer, colon cancer and gastric cancer (PMID: 34179501).",
    "The AFF4 Y256C mutation is located in the highly conserved ALF homology domain of the protein. While this mutation has not been functionally characterized, gain-of-function mutations in this domain, including P253R, T254S/A, A255T, R258W, and M260T, provide the genetic basis for the germline syndrome CHOPS, which causes significant skeletal, heart and lung defects (PMID: 25730767)",
    "AFF4 (AF4/FMR2 family member 4 ) is a scaffolding protein that helps assemble and is a core component of the transcription super elongation complex (SEC) (PMID: 31147444). The SEC functions to remove RNA polymerase II from proximal-promoter pausing, thus regulating the rapid induction of gene transcription. AFF4 has also been shown to play a role in the transcriptional activation of HIV-1 viral genes (PMID: 28134250). AFF4 has many direct transcriptional targets such as MYC and JUN, and has been linked to transcriptional upregulation of TMEM100, ZNF711, and FAM13C, among others (PMID: 25730767). Germline gain-of-function mutations in the highly conserved fourteen amino acid ALF (AF4/LAF4/FMR2) homology domain of AFF4 underlie the germline syndrome CHOPS (C-cognitive impairment and coarse facies; H-heart defects; O-obesity; P-pulmonary involvement; S-short stature and skeletal dysplasia)(PMID: 25730767). AF4-domain-mutation of the AFF4 gene specifically in Purkinje cells in the brain was identified as the cause of neurodegeneration in a \"robotic mouse\" model that developed early-onset de novo ataxia and cataracts (PMID: 12629167). In cancer, alterations of the SEC can allow unregulated transcriptional elongation and lead to tumorigenesis. AFF4-KMT2A (MLL) fusions have been identified in pediatric acute leukemia, whereby the AF4 domain of AFF4 interacts with selectivity factor 1 (SL1) on chromatin to load TATA-binding protein (TBP) onto the promoter to initiate RNA polymerase II-dependent and constitutive transcription (PMID: 28701730). Overexpression of AFF4 has been observed in human head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) (PMID: 29741610) and melanoma (PMID: 33417923). In preclinical models, AFF4 overexpression enhanced proliferation, migration and invasion of HNSCC and melanoma cells through SOX-2 and c-Jun, which could be reversed with AFF4 depletion via siRNA. In bladder cancer cell line models, METTL3, an important RNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase, was found to be overexpressed resulting in m6A modification of AFF4, leading to enhanced promoter binding and transcription of MYC (PMID: 30659266).",
    "AGO1 (also Argonaute-1) is an RNA silencing protein that is a member of the Argonaute family (PMID: 15105377, 23746446). AGO1 regulates RNA-mediated gene silencing, or RNA interference (RNAi) (PMID: 15105377, 23746446). Argonaute proteins are an essential component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is guided to mRNA targets by mircoRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (PMID: 19239886, 23654304, 17928262). Upon single-stranded RNA-mediated complementarity-based recognition of mRNAs, AGO1 inhibits translation of the mRNA target (PMID: 22231398). In addition, AGO1 has diverse roles in the regulation of small RNA processing including translation repression, regulation of miRNA maturation and heterochromatin formation (PMID: 22961379, 22231398). AGO1 is altered by overexpression in various cancers, such as in colorectal and hepatocellular cancer (PMID: 29487329, 20146808). Somatic mutations in AGO1 have been identified, however, have not been functionally characterized. Loss of AGO1 in hepatocellular cancer cell lines resulted in decreased proliferation and invasion, suggesting that AGO1 functions as an oncogene (PMID: 29487329, 24086155).",

    "AGO2 is an essential protein that regulates RNA-mediated gene silencing, or RNA interference (RNAi). AGO2 is the catalytic component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and has endonuclease activity (PMID: 15105377, 23746446). Upon single-stranded RNA-mediated, complementarity-based recognition of mRNAs, AGO2 either cleaves or inhibits translation of its targets (PMID: 19239886, 23654304). In addition, AGO2 has diverse roles in the regulation of small RNA processing including translation repression, regulation of miRNA maturation and heterochromatin formation (PMID: 26284139). Oncogenic proteins, such as mutant KRAS, can also complex with AGO2 to mediate gene silencing (PMID: 26854235). AGO2 is altered by amplification and overexpression in various cancers, such as ovarian, breast and prostate (PMID: 20146808, 24427355). In contrast, AGO2 protein levels are depleted in some melanoma tumor samples (PMID: 24169347). Differential AGO2 expression levels have been linked to dysregulated RNA processing (PMID: 23201202).",

    "AJUBA is a scaffolding protein that is a member of the Zynzin/Ajuba LIM-domain containing protein family (PMID: 31740385, 15520811). AJUBA is a promiscuous protein that can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm to mediate protein-protein interactions (PMID: 15520811, 17909014). Binding of AJUBA modulates the activity of many protein complexes involved in regulating diverse cellular processes including cellular adhesion, tension sensing, cellular motility, mitosis and microRNA processing, among others (PMID: 31740385, 12417594, 13678582, 20616046, 17621269). In addition, AJUBA is an important mediator of many signaling pathways including WNT, MAPK and Hippo pathways (PMID: 31740385, 24336325). For example, AJUBA interacts with LATS2, an important kinase in the Hippo pathway, to mediate downstream signaling (PMID: 24336325). In addition, AJUBA functions as a transcriptional co-repressor that interacts with SLUG domain proteins (involved in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition), nuclear hormone receptors and SP1 (PMID: 17909014, 20133701). Reduced activity of AJUBA in cancer-derived cell lines results in enhanced proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and increased growth in murine xenografts (PMID: 30006462, 24336325), suggesting that AJUBA predominantly functions as a tumor suppressor. However, AJUBA expression has also been found to be an indicator of poor prognosis and cancer progression in several tumor types (PMID: 27172796, 29299158, 30597111, 28422308). Somatic mutations in AJUBA are found in various cancer types including head and neck, orpharyngeal, esophageal squamous cancer, among others (PMID: 25631445, 30046007, 29127303, 25839328, 25303977).

    "AKT1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a critical downstream effector in the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signaling pathway. Following activation of PI3K, cytosolic inactive AKT1 is recruited to the membrane and engages PIP3 (PtdIns3,4,5-P3), leading to phosphorylation and activation of AKT1 (PMID: 28431241). AKT1 can activate a number of downstream substrates, including GSK3, FOXO and mTORC1, which are critical for cellular survival, proliferation, and metabolism (PMID: 9843996, 7611497). Negative regulation of AKT1 occurs when PI3K signaling is terminated by PTEN phosphatase activity (PMID: 28431241). AKT1 is frequently activated in cancers, typically through activation of the PI3K pathway or by inactivation of PTEN (PMID: 28431241). Activating mutations in AKT1 (PMID: 17611497, 23134728, 20440266) and infrequent AKT1 gene amplification (PMID: 18767981) have been identified in human cancers, which allow for phosphoinositide-independent AKT1 activation. The ATP-competitive AKT1 inhibitor AZD5363 has demonstrated activity in patients with AKT1-mutant cancers (PMID: 28489509). Negative feedback mechanisms can mediate AKT-inhibitor resistance in human cancers with dysregulated AKT signaling (PMID: 29535262, 29339542).",

AKT2 activation occurs when its pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) dislodges from the kinase domain (KD), localizes to the cell membrane, and several of its key residues become phosphorylated (PMID: 9374542). AKT2 is an oncogene that is activated in numerous cancers, mostly through amplification of the 19q13.1-q13.2 chromosomal region (PMID: 1409633, 9496907) or overexpression (PMID: 11756242), which promote invasion and metastasis (PMID: 12517798).

    "ALB (also serum albumin) is the most abundant protein in blood plasma and composes half of human serum (PMID: 30097614, 25161624). ALB is produced in the liver as the precursor prealbumin before transport to relevant sites for processing (PMID: 2503514). The main function of ALB is to serve as a carrier for proteins that aren’t soluble, including hormones, fatty acids, metals, toxins and bilirubin, among others (PMID: 26055641). In addition, ALB associates with drugs, which can either positively or negatively impact their activity (PMID: 26055641, 25161624, 31704999). Paciltaxel, a breast cancer therapy, is an example of a drug that can be pre-loaded onto albumin prior to injection in an effort to improve drug efficacy (PMID: 25161624). Receptor-mediated endocytosis of ALB is a mechanism of nutrient scavenging in rapidly proliferating cancer cells (PMID: 30097614, 26055641). ALB is then bound by the internal scavenging receptors gp30 and gp18, which break ALB into amino acids and fatty acids (PMID: 8463286). The Fc receptor is an important regulator of endocytic recycling of ALB; downregulation of this receptor is found in cancer (PMID: 27384673). Patients with various malignancies, including cancer, may experience hypoalbuminemia (low albumin) and hyperalbuminemia (high albumin) (PMID: 27612919).

    "ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is a member of the insulin receptor family (PMID: 24060861). Ligand binding to ALK results in activation of downstream signaling including the JAK-STAT, RAS-MAPK, PI3K-mTOR and JUN pathways (PMID: 24060861, 24715763). ALK signaling plays an important role in nervous system development (PMID: 9053841) as well as regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and transformation (PMID: 19737948). ALK translocations are common in cancer and predominantly result in the constitutive activation of ALK kinase activity. The nucleophosmin (NPM1)-ALK fusion protein is found in 60% of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs) (PMID: 9736036) while the EML4-ALK fusion protein is found in 3-5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (PMID: 25079552). Additional ALK translocations have been found in a variety of tumor types including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma (PMID: 24060861). ALK is found overexpressed or somatically mutated in multiple cancers, and secondary mutations in ALK are common after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (PMID: 24060861). The ALK kinase inhibitors crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib have been FDA-approved for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 27413075, 25754348, 25170012).",
    "Amplification of ALOX12B typically results in the overexpression of the protein. These mutations have been identified in gastric cancer and leiomyosarcoma (PMID: 34790376, 26541895)",
    ". In vitro studies with C33A cells overexpressing ALOX12B demonstrate that amplification is activating as measured by increased cellular proliferation via upregulation of the PI3K/ERK1 signaling pathway (PMID: 32724378)",
    "ALOX12B (also 12R-LOX) is a lipoxygenase that is a member of the LOX protein family (PMID: 24021977). 12R-LOX, the enzyme encoded by the gene ALOX12B, mediates fatty acid metabolism by catalyzing the addition of an oxygen molecule to arachidonic acid, generating the molecule 12R-HPETE (PMID: 24021977). 12R-LOX is active primarily in the skin and other epithelial tissues (PMID: 9618483, 10100631, 10446122) and plays an important role in the establishment of the epidermal barrier function (PMID: 17403930, 21558561). Another LOX family member, eLOX3, is required for the downstream synthesis of hepoxilins after 12R-HPETE generation; these play key roles in epithelial permeability and signaling (PMID: 15629692, 24021977, 19558494). ALOX12B also mediates immunosuppressive activity by decreasing antigen presentation on T cells (PMID: 22503541). Inactivating mutations in ALOX12B have been observed in autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by dried, scaling skin (PMID: 11773004, 16116617, 15629692, 19131948, 17139268). Somatic missense, nonsense mutations and deletions of ALOX12B are found in a wide range of cancers, including melanoma and other skin cancers; however, these alterations have yet to be functionally validated (cBioPortal, MSKCC, April 2020). Amplification of ALOX12B in breast and ovarian cancer has been associated with reduced cytolytic activity by the immune system (PMID: 25594174). In addition, ALOX12B is activated in cancer cells treated with therapies that induce arachidonic acid via a p53-dependent mechanism (PMID: 30258081).",
    "Truncating mutations of AMER1 are common in colorectal cancer and are associated with a mesenchymal phenotype (PMID: 26071483)",
    ". Loss of AMER1 protein in cells results in decreased APC protein levels and decreased localization of APC to the plasma membrane (PMID: 26071483)",
    "AMER1 (APC membrane recruitment 1) is an APC-binding protein that regulates the cellular localization of the APC tumor suppressor, thereby regulating APC-dependent cellular morphogenesis, cell migration and cell-cell adhesion (PMID: 17925383, 20843316, 27462415). AMER1 also functions as a negative regulator of WNT/β-catenin signaling (PMID: 21248786, 17510365, 20843316). In this capacity, AMER1 acts as a scaffold protein by assembling β-catenin and members of the destruction complex at the plasma membrane, which is necessary for β-catenin degradation (PMID: 17510365, 21498506). The AMER1 gene is mutated in approximately 5-10% of Wilms tumors, a pediatric kidney cancer (PMID: 17204608, 21248786, 19137020, 18311776, 26274016). Missense and truncating AMER1 mutations are found in approximately 7-10% of colorectal cancers and correlate with reduced WNT signaling (PMID: 26071483). This data is consistent with AMER1 functioning as a tumor suppressor, as loss of AMER1 results in activation of WNT/ β-catenin signaling (PMID: 17510365, 17510365).",

    ". Restoring ANKRD11 expression in breast cancer cell lines reduced proliferation through increased CDKN1A expression. Knockdown of AKNRD11 reduced the ability of p53 to activate CDKN1A (PMID: 18840648)",
    ". AKNRD11 has also been shown to alleviate mitotic defects of mutant p53 by restoring a native confirmation to p53 (PMID: 21986947)",
    "ANKRD11 is an ankyrin repeat domain protein that binds and suppresses the function of the p160 coactivator family (PMID: 15184363), thereby inhibiting ligand-dependent transcriptional activation. ANKRD11 is also a coactivator of the p53 tumor suppressor (PMID: 18840648), thereby influencing many pathways relevant to cancer, including transcriptional initiation, cell cycle regulation, ion transport and Notch signaling. Studies in murine and human neural precursors demonstrate that ANKRD11 can function as a chromatin regulator that binds histone deacetylases and alters gene expression (PMID: 25556659). Heterozygous mutations in ANKRD11 have been reported to cause KBG syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and macrodontia (PMID: 21782149). ANKRD11 is hypermethylated in breast cancer leading to decreased transcriptional activity, suggesting that ANKRD11 functions as a putative tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 22538187).",
    "APC deletions have been detected in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (PMID: 15643602, 25317407)",
    ". These alterations predominantly encompass the entire APC locus leading to haploinsuffuciciency (PMID: 11867715)",
    ". Based on the function of APC as a tumor suppressor, loss of APC through deletion mutations is likely to result in aberrant WNT-pathway activation and is associated with hyperplasia and eventual tumor progression (PMID: 8259511)",
    "APC is a negative regulator of the pro-oncogenic WNT/ β-catenin signaling pathway (PMID: 8259518, 8259519). The main tumor suppressive role of APC is to modulate intracellular levels of β-catenin (PMID: 11978510). APC is an essential member of the destruction complex, which targets cytosolic β-catenin for ubiquitination and degradation (PMID: 10984057). When the activity of APC is lost, there is an aberrant increase in WNT-pathway activation, often leading to hyperplasia and eventually tumor progression (PMID: 8259511). A threshold of APC expression is required to suppress tumor formation, and this level is finely balanced (PMID: 11743581). Germline mutations in the APC gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (PMID: 1651174, 1651562), a disease in which 95% of people progress to develop colorectal cancer (PMID: 1528264). In addition, heritable mutations in APC are responsible for the development of a number of related diseases, including Turcot Syndrome, Gardner Syndrome and Flat Adenoma Syndrome (FAS) (PMID: 8593545). APC mutations, much like those seen in FAS, have been observed in 50-80% of sporadic colorectal cancers (PMID: 17143297). Somatic mutations in APC function as tumor-initiating events and are also observed in a number of other human cancers including breast, stomach, and prostate (PMID: 27302369, 29316426). The majority of APC mutations are loss-of-function and occur in a region important for β-catenin binding (PMID: 10784639, 1338904). Inhibitors of the WNT pathway are currently in clinical development (PMID: 24981364).",

Overexpression of AR in prostate cancer cell lines and xenograft models demonstrates that it is activating as measured by increased proliferation in androgen-deprived media and increased proliferation in the presence of the anti-androgen, bicalutamide, compared to cells with normal AR expression (PMID: 7511045, 10496349, 11306464, 14702632)",

    "AR (androgen receptor) is a nuclear receptor that is activated following binding of androgenic hormones (PMID: 1865110, 8809738). The AR protein acts as a steroid-hormone activated transcription factor that regulates gene transcription. In the absence of androgen, AR is predominantly maintained in an inactive conformation in the cytoplasm (PMID: 9175625, 12269826). Upon androgen binding, AR undergoes an activating conformational change that allows for its translocation into the nucleus, homodimerization and binding to DNA at sites with androgen response elements (ARE) motifs (PMID: 9175625, 12000757, 11376111, 8360187). In concert with accessory coactivators and corepressors, AR serves to activate or repress the transcription of AR-mediated target genes (PMID: 11931767, 17679089). Germline loss-of-function mutations in AR cause genetic XY males and rodents to develop as external phenotypic females, also lacking internal sexual secondary organs (PMID: 4402348, 2341409, 2041777, 3186717, 2594783). AR signaling is important in prostate cancers, particularly in tumors that become resistant to androgen deprivation therapies, termed castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). AR is frequently altered in CRPCs resulting in continued activation despite a castrate level of androgen (PMID: 26566796). Mutations in AR can lead to clinical resistance to antiandrogen therapy in CRPC (PMID: 23580326).",

    "ARAF is a serine/threonine protein kinase and signaling component in the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinase signaling pathway. ARAF is a member of the RAF kinase family, which also includes BRAF and CRAF (PMID: 17555829). ARAF is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest physiological levels found in the urogenital organs (PMID: 10768864). Upon activation by RAS proteins, ARAF forms dimers with BRAF and CRAF, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of the downstream signaling effectors MEK and subsequently ERK. Activation of the RAS signaling cascade ultimately leads to increased cell growth and proliferation (PMID: 21779496). ARAF activating mutations are found at low frequencies in cholangiocarcinomas, lung, uterine and histiocytic carcinomas (PMID: 25608663, 26566875). The most common oncogenic ARAF mutation impairs a phosphorylation site that negatively regulates RAS binding and ARAF activation, leading to hyperactivity of the MAP-kinase signaling pathway (PMID: 24569458). ARAF-mutant cancers may be sensitive to RAF and MAPK family inhibitors, such as sorafenib (PMID: 24569458).",

    "ARHGAP35 (also GRLF1) is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates the activity of Rho-family small GTPases (guanosine triphosphatases) (PMID: 31013840). Rho GTPases modulate actin-mediated cellular functions including cellular adhesion, migration and cell division (PMID: 31013840, 12606561). ARHGAP35 encodes the protein p190A which, along with the paralog p190B, function as the main GAP proteins that regulate Rho cellular activity (PMID: 8537347). GAP proteins, such as p190A, enhance nucleotide hydrolysis and inhibit GTPase signaling activity (PMID: 27628050). p190A interacts with a variety of effector molecules, including RHOA, RHOC and RAC1, among others, to regulate cell adhesion and migration (PMID: 28287334, 27646271). In addition, p190A associates with TFII-I and eIF3A to mediate gene expression and translation, respectively (PMID: 28007963, 15629714). p190A is also implicated in several other cellular processes including entosis, dendritic spine formation and endothelial permeability (PMID: 18045538, 18267090, 17562701). Somatic mutations in ARHGAP35 have been identified in a variety of tumor types in pan-cancer studies, most predominantly in uterine carcinomas (PMID: 24132290, 24390350). ARHGAP35 mutations have also been associated with Hürthle cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer and renal angiomyolipoma (PMID: 30107175, 28176259, 27494029). These alterations commonly occur as nonsense or frameshift mutations throughout the ARHGAP35 gene (PMID: 31013840, 27646271). However, disruption of p190A in functional assays has both growth inhibitory and proliferative effects, suggesting that p190A may function as a tumor suppressor or oncogene depending on the context (PMID: 31013840, 27646271).",

ARHGEF28 binds and functions as either a GEF or a scaffolding protein to initiate FAK activation and cell contractility (PMID: 24467206, 24006257). Functional studies have demonstrated that the RhoA-FAK pathway is important for cancer cell proliferation and migration in breast and lung cancer models (PMID: 19147981, 23358651, 21224360). Both familial and sporadic mutations in ARHGEF28 have been identified in the neurological disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (PMID: 23286752); however, somatic mutations in ARHGEF28 are infrequent in human cancers.",

    "ARID1A, also known as BAF250A, is a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, and plays a role in altering chromatin structure for various cellular functions, including transcription, DNA synthesis and DNA repair (PMID: 25387058, 23208470). ARID1A binds to AT-rich regions of DNA and helps recruit other members of the SWI/SWF complex, such as SMARCA and BAF complexes. Together, these complexes are involved in ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling via nucleosome displacement and thus allow for gene expression activation (PMID: 12672490, 10078207, 11073988). In a mouse model of colon cancer, ARID1A loss specifically altered enhancer-mediated gene regulation (PMID: 27941798). Germline mutations in ARID1A result in Coffin-Siris syndrome, which is characterized by developmental delay and coarse facial features (PMID: 11170086). Additionally, ARID1A has been identified as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancer types, including gynecologic cancers, ovarian clear cell carcinomas and endometrial cancers (PMID: 21900401, 21590771, 20826764).",

    ". Functional studies have demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of ARID2 reduces protein levels of other subunits of the PBAF complex, suggesting that ARID2 is necessary for PBAF complex stability. In addition, loss of ARID2 expression abolishes transcription of the interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1), which is needed for IFN-induced anti-proliferative activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (PMID: 15985610, 16847454)",
    ". Though further evidence is needed, these observations suggest that ARID2 functions as a tumor suppressor.",
    "ARID2, also known as BAF200, is a subunit in the PBAF complex, a subtype of the SWI/SNF complex, which facilitates nuclear receptor-mediated, ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by modulating chromatin structure to make DNA more accessible (PMID: 19234488, 11780067). ARID2 contains a conserved AT-rich DNA interaction domain and is thought to confer specificity to the PBAF complex (PMID: 15985610). Most ARID2 mutations found in tumors are inactivating, suggesting ARID2 is a tumor suppressor gene. ARID2 mutations are most commonly found in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where they often lead to an inactive, truncated protein (PMID: 21822264). ARID2 mutations are also found in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (PMID: 23047306, 22817889), and are associated with loss of heterozygosity (LOH).",
    "ARID3A truncation mutations can produce several forms of C-terminally truncated proteins. Loss of ARID3A in embryonic kidney cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in a transgenic mouse model resulted in the bypass of cellular senescence, increased cellular plasticity, and development of in vivo teratomas compared to wildtype (PMID: 24511468, 20680960)",
    "ARID3A (also Bright) is a member of the ARID family of DNA binding proteins. ARID3A functions as a transcription factor that regulates the transcription of genes relevant in B-cell biology, including the immunoglobulin heavy chain in lymphocytes (PMID: 24678314). Expression of ARID3A is tightly controlled during B cell differentiation with the highest expression occurring in hematopoietic stem cells, pre-B cells, transitional B cells, activated B cells, memory B cells and plasma cells (PMID: 15203319, 26685208, 21199920). ARID3A associates with BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) and E2F1 to mediate DNA binding and regulation of transcription (PMID: 9780002, 15203319). Overexpression of ARID3A in murine studies results in autoimmunity highlighting the importance of ARID3A in B cell regulation (PMID: 15203319, 21963220). In addition to the role of ARID3A in B cells, ARID3A can also cooperate with TP53 to activate the expression of p21, a protein involved in cell cycle arrest, in a range of cell types (PMID: 22172947). Additional roles for ARID3A gene regulation have been identified, including in colorectal cancer studies (PMID: 26121572, 24366420). However, somatic mutations in ARID3A are relatively rare in human cancers.",
    "ARID3B (also BDP) is a member of the ARID family of DNA binding proteins. ARID3B functions as a transcription factor that is most highly expressed in squamous epithelium (PMID: 24704276). ARID3B can homodimerize or heterodimerize with other ARID3 family members and interact with additional transcription factors including the Rb-associated proteins RBP1 and RBP2 to regulate gene expression in a variety of cellular contexts (PMID: 10446990). Expression of ARID3B is required for B cell differentiation (PMID: 27537840) and has been implicated in the regulation of oncogenic genes in the context of ovarian cancer (PMID: 26121572), oral squamous cancer (PMID: 25858147), and neuroblastomas (PMID: 16951138). ARID3B activity is also important in regulating cancer stemness (PMID: 25858157), the maintenance of mesenchymal stem cells (PMID: 16530748) and the organization of the chromatin state (PMID: 26776511). Somatic mutations in ARID3B are relatively rare in human cancers; however, ARID3B is overexpressed in ovarian cancer and neuroblastoma (PMID: 24704276). Consistent with these data overexpression of ARID3B in ovarian cancers has been shown to be transforming in preclinical studies (PMID: 25327563).",
    "ARID3C (also Brightlike) is a member of the ARID family of DNA binding proteins (PMID: 24704276). ARID3C functions as a transcription factor and shares substantial sequence homology with homologs ARID3A and ARID3B. The highest expression of ARID3C has been identified in B lineage lymphocytes and activated follicular B cells (PMID: 21955986). While the function of ARID3C has not been extensively characterized, ARID3C can bind ARID3A at known ARID3A chromatin binding sites (PMID: 21955986). Importantly, ARID3A and ARID3C co-regulate immunoglobulin heavy chain transcription in B lymphocytes (PMID: 21955986). Somatic mutations in ARID3C are rare in human cancers and further functional studies are required to delineate the role of ARID3C in cancer (PMID: 24704276).",

ARID4A, and the homologous gene ARID4B, function as transcription factors that regulate gene expression and chromatin state (PMID: 17043311). Both ARID4A and ARID4B bind retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and function as repressors of E2F-mediated transcription by acting as adaptors to recruit the mSin3A histone deacetylase (HDAC) histone-modifying complex to E2F target genes (PMID: 1857421, 11283269). The ARID4A-RB complex is involved in many cellular functions including cellular differentiation, cellular proliferation, apoptosis and DNA damage. ARID4A also interacts with breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1), a protein that mediates anti-metastasis gene expression programs (PMID: 18211900, 14581478).

    "ARID5A (also MRF1) is an RNA binding protein that is a member of the ARID transcription factor family (PMID: 29787158). ARID5A binds the 3’UTR of IL-6 mRNA (PMID: 23676272) and regulates IL-6 mRNA stability in response to cytokine stimulation (PMID: 23676272). ARID5A expression is increased in macrophages and T-cells in response to LPS, IL-1β, and IL-6 treatment (PMID: 23676272). IL-6 induces the expression of ARID5A in T-cells leading to differentiation into inflammatory T-cells (such as Th17 cells) via a STAT3 dependent mechanism (PMID: 24782182, 27022145). Loss of ARID5A in murine hematopoietic and lung tissues results in a reduction of STAT3 and IL-6 expression and a blunting of the immune response, suggesting that ARID5A plays a critical role in inflammation, T-cell differentiation and autoimmunity (PMID: 27022145, 28379390). IL-6 stability is also important for the regulation of key cell signaling pathways including the NF-κB and MAPK pathways (PMID: 28168301). In addition, ARID5A has been implicated in RNA binding to other T-cell-related mRNAs, including T-bet, and DNA binding in collaboration with Sox9 in chondrocytes (PMID: 21346191). Somatic ARID5A mutations are rare in human cancers; however, several mutations have been identified in a diverse range of cancers.",

    "ASXL1 is a member of the Polycomb group of proteins, and is a chromatin binder that is involved in transcription regulation. ASXL1 is a member of the ASXL gene family that includes ASXL1, ASXL2 and ASXL3, which all have a C-terminal plant homology domain (PHD domain) that is predicted to recognize histone H3 tails via methylated lysines (PMID: 23147254). ASXL1 interacts directly with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and has a role in the recruitment of PRC2 to chromatin and subsequent H3K27me3 histone modifications (PMID: 22897849). Mutations in ASXL1 result in the inability of Polycomb target genes to be effectively repressed leading to dysregulated gene expression, such as at the HOXA gene cluster (PMID: 22897849). ASXL1 also independently interacts with the chromatin protein BAP1 (PMID: 22878500). The BAP1-ASXL1 complex can regulate the H2AK119 ubiquitin mark placed by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) (PMID: 20436459). Germline heterozygous mutations in ASXL1 have been found in patients with Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a developmental disorder that results in distinctive craniofacial abnormalities (PMID: 21706002).

    "ATM is a member of the protein superfamily of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related serine/threonine kinases (PIKKs). ATM functions as a tumor suppressor that initiates DNA damage checkpoint signaling after accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) or after accumulation of other forms of cellular stress (PMID: 23219553). Activated ATM can phosphorylate hundreds of substrates in order to initiate and amplify the DNA damage response (PMID: 17525332) resulting in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Germline loss-of-function mutations in ATM have been identified in the autosomal recessive disorder Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), a disorder that presents with a variety of neurologic conditions, lung and skin disorders and immunodeficiency (PMID: 21792198). Patients with A-T are also predisposed to a wide variety of cancers, particularly childhood lymphomas and leukemia as well as breast cancer (PMID: 21792198). Somatic mutations in ATM have been identified in lymphoid malignancies and a selection of solid tumors (PMID: 12400598, 27413114). ATM-mutant cancers are increasingly sensitive to DNA damaging agents due to deficits in DNA repair pathways, and ATM loss may result in better response to checkpoint inhibition in some cancers (PMID: 27413114, 29489427).",

ATR responds to DNA damage and single-strand DNA by activating cell-cycle checkpoint and DNA repair pathways (PMID: 12791985, 20818375, 17157788). It is also involved in regulating telomere maintenance, initiation of DNA replication and meiosis (PMID: 17687332, 15220931, 23824539). Germline mutations of ATR are associated with cancer predisposition and Seckel syndrome, a condition associated with central nervous system disorders (PMID: 22341969, 12640452).

    ". Based on loss of function studies, ATRX deletions are expected to result in chromosomal instability and alternate lengthening of telomeres (ALT) (PMID: 21719641, 24148618)",
    "ATRX (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) is a chromatin regulator that functions as a member of the SWI/SNF helicase family (PMID: 20110566, 17609377). ATRX is involved in the incorporation of histone H3.3 during telomere replication (PMID: 20110566). Loss of ATRX activity results in aberrant DNA methylation, histone composition and transcription, suggesting that ATRX functions predominantly as an epigenetic regulator (PMID: 29535300). Germline mutations in ATRX result in a severe form of X-linked mental retardation often associated with alpha-thalassemia (ATRX) syndrome (PMID: 8968741). Loss-of-function mutations or reduced ATRX expression is strongly correlated with an alternate lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype in tumors (PMID: 21719641).

    "ATXN2 is an RNA binding protein that regulates protein translation. Through interactions with poly(A) binding protein (PABP), ATXN2 regulates mRNA translation and localizes to stress granules and P-bodies, cellular components important for regulation of mRNA degradation and translation (PMID: 22508507, 15342467).

    "ATXN7 (also SCA7) is a chromatin-modifying protein that functions as a transcriptional co-activator (PMID: 16494529). ATXN7 is a component of the multi-subunit SAGA transcriptional complex that has multiple enzymatic functions including histone acetylation (PMID: 21746879) and deubiquitination (PMID: 21746879). The SAGA complex facilitates transcriptional regulation by remodeling chromatin via GCN5-mediated histone acetylation to promote general transcription factor binding to DNA (PMID: 21746879). In addition, the SAGA complex mediates targeting of the transcriptional pre-initiation complex to promoters and deubiquitination via the cofactors ATXN7L3, USP22, and ENY2 to mediate protein translation (PMID: 18206972). SAGA-dependent histone H2B deubiquitination is also critical for the DNA damage response, an activity that is especially important during class switch recombination (PMID: 21746879, 18206972). Trinucleotide repeat expansions in the coding region of the ATXN7 gene are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a neurological disorder that results in macular dystrophy and progressive retinal degeneration (PMID: 9288099, 9781533, 10330346, 10640674, 3062533). In SCA7-mutant murine models and in patients with SCA7, CAG trinucleotide expansions in ATXN7 result in an abnormal polyglutamine tract (polyQ) and in nuclear accumulation of protein (PMID: 14985428). Somatic mutations in ATXN7 are found in patients with thyroid cancer and cluster predominantly in the polyglutamine domain of the protein where the germline expansions occur in SCA7 (PMID: 28584132).

The BRCA1-A complex recognizes ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2AX at DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites, facilitating damage-dependent BRCA1 localization and DNA repair (PMID: 19261748). BABAM1 has been implicated in the earliest stages of DNA interstrand cross-links repair (PMID: 26338419). The BRISC complex cleaves lysine 63 ubiquitinated substrates, playing a role in interferon responses and proper mitotic spindle assembly (PMID: 24075985, 26195665). Germline variants of BABAM1 have been reported to confer susceptibility to ovarian cancer (PMID: 20852633); however, somatic BABAM1 mutations appear to be rare in human cancers.",
    "BACH2 truncating mutations can form C-terminally truncated BACH2 protein. BACH2 is located on chromosome 6, band q15, a region frequently associated with deletions in ALL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It was noted that BACH2 expression was significantly diminished in mouse models of C-REL-/- Eμ-Myc lymphomas. Even among Eμ-Myc mice with wildtype C-REL, those expressing lower levels of BACH2 had an earlier onset of lymphomas. BACH2 was also shown to be important for tumor suppression of pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia by mediating the negative selection of pre-B cells that failed to undergo proper maturation. However, one study showed that BACH2 was also shown to be important for tumor immunosuppression because xenograft models using B16 melanoma cells in BACH2 knockout mice had slower progression rates than those in wildtype mice (PMID: 23852341, 26522720, 11746976, 26731475)",

    "BACH2 is a transcription factor that functions predominantly as a transcriptional repressor and mediates innate and adaptive immunity (PMID: 29625895). BACH2 is an important regulator of terminal differentiation in both B and T cells (PMID: 29669243, 29625895). In B cells, BACH2 activity is required for the formation of germinal centers, somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes, plasma cell lineage commitment, negative selection of pre-B cells and class switch recombination (PMID: 29540581, 29129929, 23852341). In T cells, BACH2 expression is required for memory cell activity and BACH2 downregulation is required for effector cells to appropriately differentiate (PMID: 29669243, 29625895, 28855027). In addition, BACH2 regulates the expression of KLRG1 on the surface of CD8+ T cells in order to initiate their entry into the effector or memory pool (PMID: 29669243, 29625895). Expression of BACH2 is also required to maintain the function of alveolar macrophages in the airway and to regulate the inflammatory response (PMID: 28993481). BACH2 represses the expression of several gene programs associated with immune cell differentiation programs, cell cycle, and cytokine production (PMID: 23728300, 29540581, 29529253). The activity of BACH2 is mediated by several upstream signaling pathways, including the ERK/MAPK and mTOR pathways (PMID: 29529253, 29129929, 28993481). BACH2 also competes with BCL6 DNA binding to activate TP53-mediated checkpoint control and tumor suppression (PMID: 23852341). Germline loss-of-function mutations and polymorphisms in BACH2 are associated with autoimmune and allergic disorders such as Crohn’s disease and asthma (PMID: 28530713, 23728300). Heterozygous loss of BACH2 leads to lymphocytic defects due to transcriptional and epigenetic dysfunction (PMID: 28530713), consistent with BACH2 functioning as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Somatic mutations in BACH2 are rare; however, reduced expression or promoter somatic hypermutation of BACH2 has been identified in mantle cell lymphomas and are implicated in drug resistance (PMID: 28592433).",

    "BAP1 (BRCA-associated Protein-1) is a nuclear ubiquitin hydrolase that has been implicated in several cellular processes including cell proliferation, DNA repair, chromatin regulation of gene expression, and stem cell pluripotency (PMID: 19815555, 20805357, 18757409). By deubiquitinating host cell factor-1 (HCF-1), a chromatin-associated protein that helps regulate transcription, BAP1 regulates cell proliferation (PMID: 19815555). BAP1 has been shown to regulate gene expression by forming a ternary complex with HCF-1 and the YY1 transcription factor (PMID: 20805357) and to enhance cell death by increasing progression through the G1-S checkpoint (PMID: 18757409). BAP1 loss alters class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression, which may result in altered therapeutic response to HDAC inhibitors in BAP1-depleted cancer cells (PMID: 25970771). Germline mutations of BAP1 predispose to several tumors including renal cell carcinoma, uveal melanoma and mesothelioma, which suggests that BAP1 is a tumor suppressor (PMID: 23277170, 21874000, 23849051). Somatic BAP1 mutations are also common in these tumor types, among others (PMID: 23867514, 21642991, 23277170).",

    "BARD1 is an adaptor protein that functions as an E3 ligase when in complex with BRCA1 (PMID: 8944023, 32094664, 11573085). BRCA1 is a well-characterized tumor suppressor that functions to maintain genome integrity by repairing DNA double-stranded breaks through homologous recombination and cell-cycle checkpoint activation (PMID: 20029420, 11278247). The BARD1-BRCA1 complex is involved in diverse cellular processes including various stages of DNA repair, gene expression, replication fork maintenance and chromatin regulation (PMID: 32094664, 28976962, 17873885, 29367421, 27239795). BARD1 interacts with BRCA1, binds DNA lesions on newly replicated DNA, and adds ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues on histone H2A (PMID: 32094664, 30804502). The BARD1-BRCA1 complex then mediates the resection of DNA lesions, evicts the antagonistic repair protein 53BP1, and recruits several DNA response proteins to damaged sites, including RAD51 (PMID: 32094664, 28976962, 12832489, 27239795). Poly ADP-ribose (PAR) mediates early recruitment of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex to damaged DNA sites (PMID: 25634209). Loss of BARD1 expression in murine models of breast cancer results in similar phenotypes as BRCA1 deletion, underscoring the likelihood that they function similarly (PMID: 18443292). Germline mutations in BARD1 predispose to familial breast and ovarian cancer, among other hereditary cancers (PMID: 11807980, 20077502, 16741161, 25058500). Some BARD1 variants function as dominant-negative mutations, suggesting that BARD1 predominantly functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 22350409). Somatic mutations in BARD1 are also found in human cancers and emerging data suggest that BARD1 can function as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in different cellular contexts (PMID: 18089818, 29292755, 26738429).",
    "Deletion of BBC3 results in the loss of the PUMA protein. Deletion of BBC3 in murine embryo fibroblasts and in BIM-deficient mice resulted in diminished cellular apoptosis upon induction with a strong oncogene, exacerbated hyperplasia of lymphatic organs and spontaneous malignancies compared to wildtype, suggesting that BBC3 is tumor suppressive (PMID: 14585359, 17178918)",
    ". In addition, knockdown of BBC3 in primary murine fibroblasts accelerated Myc-induced lymphomagenesis but had no effect on RAS-induced oncogenesis compared to control knockdown (PMID: 15192153)",
    ". However, BBC3-deleted mice alone do not have an increased risk for spontaneous malignancies compared to wildtype (PMID: 14585359, 14500851)",
    "BBC3 (BCL2 binding component 3, also known as PUMA) is a pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein. BBC3 contains a BH3 (BCL-2 homology 3) domain, which allows for binding to anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members, including BCL-xL and BCL-2 (PMID: 23175245). This binding releases the pro-apoptotic factors BAK and BAX, which in turn initiate apoptosis via permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane (PMID: 11463392, 17322918). BBC3 is a transcriptional target of TP53, but is also activated independently of TP53 in response to cellular stress; thus, BBC3 is considered both a p53-dependent and -independent pro-apoptotic factor (PMID: 14585359, 19641508). Although methylation-dependent silencing of BBC3 has been described in Burkitt lymphomas, somatic mutation of BBC3 is not commonly found in human cancers (PMID: 17267315, 18573879). However, BBC3 function can be altered as a consequence of perturbations of other factors in the apoptosis pathways, such as mutations in TP53, which abrogate the ability of TP53 to induce BBC3 expression (PMID: 21478674). BBC3 is a highly efficient effector of apoptosis, and BH3 mimetic peptides and small molecule therapeutics targeting anti-apoptotic proteins are being investigated as therapeutic options in cancers with dysregulated BBC3 activity (PMID: 17921043, 11463391, 19641508).",

    "BCL11B (also RIT1) is a transcription factor that is a member of the BCL family. BCL11B is predominantly expressed in T cells and the nervous system (PMID: 23211040). The activity of BCL11B is required for T cell development including lineage commitment, proliferation, differentiation and survival of T cells (PMID: 23211040) as well as in the development of cells in the central nervous system (PMID: 28424591, 29416501). In murine models, loss of BCL11B results in unsuccessful V(D)J recombination and lack of pre-T cell receptor (TCR) presentation on the cell surface (PMID: 12717433), highlighting the importance of BCL11B in T cell biology. BCL11B functions in a transcriptional complex with GATA3 to regulate gene expression in type 2 T helper cells (Th2 cells) (PMID: 29514917). BCL11B has many additional functions including regulation of chromatin state (PMID: 29466755), binding the nuclear hormone receptor NR2F1 (PMID: 23211040), and regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase during the cell cycle (PMID: 16950772).

    "BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) is a key regulator of cell apoptosis, and is part of the BCL2 family of proteins that orchestrate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (PMID: 24355989). BCL2 is considered a pro-survival factor that inhibits BAX-mediated mitochondrial permeability, thus preventing cytochrome c release and downstream caspase 9 activation through APAF1 (PMID: 9390557, 9219694, 9390557). BCL2 is commonly linked to the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain locus in follicular B-cell lymphomas via the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation (PMID: 2875799). This results in robust expression of BCL2 and downstream pro-survival signals, a key step in lymphomagenesis (PMID: 7632929). Progression of follicular lymphoma to a more aggressive disease state is often associated with MYC translocation, suggesting a synergy between BCL2 and MYC in cancer progression (PMID: 1638027, 12015982). BCL2 is found to be translocated and overexpressed particularly in haematological malignancies, but is infrequently mutated (PMID: 3262202, 16193090).

    "BCL2L1 (Bcl-2-like protein 1) belongs to the BCL-2 family of proteins and has a dual pro- and anti-apoptotic role ascribed to its different transcript isoforms produced by alternative splicing (PMID: 8358789). The two isoforms, BCL-XL and BCL-XS, inhibit and activate apoptosis, respectively. BCL-XL sequesters activators of apoptosis such as BID, thus blocking downstream activation of the apoptosis effector proteins BAX and BAK, which normally control mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome C (PMID: 17115033, 20584903, 9393856). Inhibition of apoptosis by BCL-XL is overcome by caspase-mediated cleavage (PMID: 9771973, 21256112). Although the pro-apoptotic effect of BCL-XS is poorly understood, it has been shown to interact with BCL2 and BCL-XL (PMID: 10777212, 11526448). BCL2L1 is often amplified in colorectal cancers (CRC) and its expression affects anchorage-independent growth and cell proliferation, though it is not considered a driver of tumorigenesis (PMID: 22009326).

Cytochrome c release initiates a series of signaling events that result in apoptosome formation and activation of caspase-mediated programmed cell death (PMID: 19934277, 26405162, 16243507). The anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 sequesters BCL2L11; therefore, the relative levels of BCL2L11 and BCL2 regulate many cellular processes including cell survival and tissue homeostasis (PMID: 9430630, 10576740, 25176652). There are several alternatively-spliced BIM isoforms with various levels of pro-apoptotic activity (PMID: 22728771). Expression of BIM is epigenetically downregulated in several cancer types, including chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 19403302, 20647567). Furthermore, BCL2L11 activity, in addition to a BCL2L11 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), has been shown to be a predictor of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in several contexts (PMID: 22145099, 24223824). Thus, Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) mimetics may have utility in cancers that are resistant to TKIs through a BIM-dependent mechanism (PMID: 18949058). Chemoresistance mechanisms may also arise due to downregulation of BCL2L11 expression (PMID: 18174237).",

In addition, BCL9 is a critical mediator of cell-type specific WNT-dependent transcriptional activity (PMID: 18347063, 19699733, 28174279, 30366904). BCL9-mediated WNT signaling regulates several cellular functions including migration, gene expression, mesoderm patterning, proliferation, and adhesion, among others (PMID: 15371335, 19305417, 19738061). Downregulation of BCL9 in biochemical experiments results in translocation of β-catenin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, leading to altered gene expression (PMID: 15371335). Overexpression of BCL9 and recurrent BCL9 fusions have been identified in patients with B-cell malignancies and acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 9490669, 10602418), suggesting that BCL9 functions as an oncogene. Inhibitors that target the β-catenin-BCL9 interaction may be efficacious in patients with increased BCL9 activity (PMID: 22914623).",

    "BCOR (BCL6 co-repressor) is a transcriptional repressor that is required for normal germinal center formation in B cells (PMID: 27505670). BCOR is a chromatin regulatory protein that functions in a variety of non-canonical epigenetic repressive complexes and binds the transcriptional repressor BCL6 (PMID: 27505670, 29337181). Depletion of BCOR results in loss of Polycomb protein binding at target genes, which is critical for maintaining repressed chromatin (PMID: 9337181). Additionally, the presence of RING1 and RNF2 in the BCOR complex suggests BCOR involvement in the ubiquitination of histones (PMID: 19738629). BCOR functions as a tumor suppressor that is a key regulator of early embryonic development, mesenchymal stem cell function, hematopoiesis and vertebrate laterality (PMID: 17517692, 18795143, 19578371, 10898795). Germline mutations in BCOR are responsible for the inherited oculofaciocardiodental and Lenz microphthalmia syndromes (PMID: 15004558). BCOR fusions are recurrent in soft tissue and endometrial stromal sarcomas (PMID: 22387997, 25176412, 24805859, 25360585), as well as in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (PMID: 20807888). These fusions lead to oncogenesis by activating various anti-apoptotic pathways. BCOR has been identified as both the N-terminal and the C-terminal fusion partner depending on the type of cancer in which it is expressed, suggesting differing mechanisms for oncogenesis in these tumors (PMID: 25360585). Somatic BCOR truncating mutations have also been identified in retinoblastoma and hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (PMID: 22237022, 22012066, 24047651, 25550361).",
    "The BCORL1-ELF4 fusion protein includes exons 1-11 of BCORL1 and exon 8 of ELF4 (PMID: 21499249)",
    ". This fusion protein has been identified in patients with hepataceullar carcinoma. Expression of BCORL1-ELF4 in a luciferase transcriptional reporter assay demonstrated that BCORL1-ELF4 had reduced transcriptional activity compared to controls (PMID: 21499249)",
    "BCORL1 is a transcription factor that functions to repress gene expression (PMID: 17379597). BCORL1, a homolog of the BCOR repressor, interacts with histone deacetylases to mediate transcriptional repression (PMID: 17379597). In addition, BCORL1 interacts with the CtBP corepressor and plays a role in repression of E-Cadherin, an important gene in the epithelial to mesenchymal transformation. Loss of BCORL1 results in promotion of migration and invasion in hepatocellular cancer cell lines (PMID: 26879601). BCORL1 also binds proteins in the epigenetic Polycomb Repressive 1 (PRC1) complex and mediates chromatin state changes (PMID: 27568929). Somatic mutations in BCORL1 are found in patients with adult and pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), astrocytomas and intracranial germ cell tumors (PMID: 21989985, 24047651, 24896186, 27470916, 27425854) and are predicted to be loss-of-function mutations resulting in truncation of the C-terminus of the protein. Mutations in BCORL1 are associated with age-related clonal disorders of hematopoiesis, which are hematopoietic defects that can transform to MDS or AML (PMID: 25326804, 26132940, 27084249). Overexpression of BCORL1 is also found in a subset of tumors, including in hepatocellular cancer (PMID: 26879601). BCORL1 mutations have also been shown to be relevant to vemurafenib resistance in melanoma (PMID: 29605720).",
    "BCR is a signaling molecule with serine/threonine kinase activity (PMID: 23940119). BCR has been reported to function as both a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which promotes the activation of RhoA family GTPases (PMID: 23940119), and a GTPase activating protein (GAP), which inactivates GTPase activity by stimulating the activity of the small GTP binding proteins Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42 (PMID: 7889565). In keratinocytes, BCR promotes the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, an important function for cellular migration (PMID: 23940119). Loss of BCR in mice results in normal development, however; mice develop a neutrophil expansion due to an increase in reactive oxygen metabolite production (PMID: 7889565). BCR also functions as a mediator of signaling and has modular domains that serve as binding sites for GRB2, GRB10, 14-3-3 and the ABL proteins (PMID: 15719031). BCR is most commonly studied as a translocation partner in the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein (or Philadelphia chromosome), which leads to a constitutively active kinase. The BCR-ABL1 fusion protein is found in essentially all cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and a small proportion of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). BCR-ABL1 binds signaling molecules, including SOS and GRB2, and initiates downstream signaling pathways including the PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK pathways (PMID: 15719031). BCR-ABL1-translocated cancers are sensitive to the kinase inhibitor imatinib, and second-generation kinase inhibitors have been identified that target drug resistance mechanisms that arise in response to imatinib (PMID: 17457302).",

CLL cell lines engineered to have BIRC3 deletions show that the absence of BIRC3 is associated with activation of the NFkB pathway, increased expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members and increased sensitivity to NF-kB inhibition compared to cells expressing wildtype BIRC3 (PMID: 30487125)",
    "If the Oncogenic Mutations occur at BIRC3, could lead ton Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma",
    "BIRC3 (baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3, or cIAP2) is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins and contains catalytic ubiquitinase activity (PMID: 8548810, 20651737). BIRC3 activates the canonical NFκB signaling pathway following tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α binding to TNFR1 (TNF receptor 1). TNFR1 activation triggers assembly of a complex wherein BIRC3 mediates ubiquitination of several factors, resulting in derepression of NFκB (PMID: 20651737, 11907583). BIRC3 also activates non-canonical NFκB signaling by mediating ubiquitination of NIK (NFκB-inducing kinase) (PMID: 20651737, 11907583). In addition, BIRC3 functions as an inhibitor of apoptosis by directly ubiquitinating caspases 3 and 7 (PMID: 20651737), targeting them for degradation. BIRC3 and its homolog, BIRC2 (cIAP1), are functionally redundant in preclinical model systems, but also have non-overlapping expression patterns suggesting distinct biological functions (PMID: 20651737, 21430708). Somatic BIRC3 truncating mutations and deletions have been identified in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 26837699, 22308293). In addition, BIRC3 amplifications have been identified in lung cancers (PMID: 12651874).",
    "Truncating mutations in BLM have been found in patients with Bloom syndrome who progress to early-onset colorectal cancer (PMID: 26358404)",
    ". Deleterious mutations in BLM lead to increased genetic instability in gastric cancer, even in cancers with concurrent microsatellite instability (PMID: 11532193)",
    "BLM (also Bloom syndrome protein) is a DNA helicase that functions by unwinding double-stranded DNA intermediates during multiple cellular functions, including double-strand break repair by homologous recombination, telomere maintenance and replication (PMID: 21047263, 24606147). BLM gene expression is cell cycle regulated and BLM has been shown to interact with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Mindbomb 1 (MIB1) and a highly conserved DNA topoisomerase 2β-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) (PMID: 24239288). The helicase activity of BLM is critical for preserving the fidelity of the genome, and deleterious mutations result in a strong predisposition for a broad spectrum of cancers across multiple tissue types, generally characterized as highly aggressive and occurring early in life. Germline mutations in BLM lead to the rare genetic disorder Bloom syndrome (BS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe chromosomal instability and increased cancer risk (PMID: 17407155). Heterozygous inherited deleterious mutations in BLM have been associated with an increased risk for breast cancer (PMID: 23028338) and colorectal cancers (PMID: 26358404), albeit with a moderate penetrance for the latter. Somatic mutations in BLM are rare in human cancers, however, truncating mutations in BLM have been identified in colorectal cancers with a microsatellite instability (PMID: 11532193).",
    "BMPR1A truncating mutations typically result in the loss of BMPR1A function. Loss of BMPR1A has been identified in prostate cancer and juvenile polyposis syndrome (PMID: 10850425, 20843829)",
    ". In vitro studies with 786-O, 293T, 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 renal cancer cells demonstrated that loss of BMPR1A is inactivating as measured by promotion of lung-specific metastasis from loss of BMP signaling (PMID: 35842443)",
    "BMPR1A is a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor that belongs to the transforming growth factor β (TGF β) family (PMID: 22992590). TGFß signaling controls multiple biological processes including cellular proliferation, differentiation and tissue homeostasis (PMID: 22992590, 11057902). BMPR1A functions as a type I receptor and therefore must associate with the type II receptor BMPR2 to initiate ligand binding (PMID: 22992590). BMP receptors receive signals from growth factor and cytokine BMP ligands and transduce these signals through SMAD and non-SMAD pathways to regulate cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis (PMID: 10712517, 9738456, 19762341). BMPR1A signaling also plays a role in apoptosis, osteoblast function and adipocyte differentiation (PMID: 15090551). Germline mutations of BMPR1A are found in individuals with juvenile polyposis syndrome, juvenile intestinal polyposis and Cowden syndrome (PMID: 15235019, 11536076). BMPR1A mutations are associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal polyps and colon cancer (PMID: 25389115, 21203531).",

    "BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (PMID: 15520807), which under physiologic conditions regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular functions, including proliferation (PMID: 24202393). Genetic alterations in BRAF are found in a large percentage of melanomas, thyroid cancers and histiocytic neoplasms as well as a small fraction of lung and colorectal cancers. The most common BRAF point mutation is V600E, which deregulates the protein's kinase activity leading to constitutive BRAF activation, as BRAF V600E can signal as a monomer independently of RAS or upstream activation (PMID: 20179705). Other BRAF mutations have been found that affect the protein's propensity to dimerize (PMID: 16858395, 26343582, 12068308). The product of these alterations is a BRAF kinase that can activate MAPK signaling in an unregulated manner and, in some instances, is directly responsible for cancer growth (PMID: 15520807).

    "BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) is a tumor suppressor gene that functions as a multifunctional ubiquitin E3 ligase. BRCA1 has been implicated in regulating diverse cellular processes including transcription, protein ubiquitination, cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response, with a particularly important role in DNA repair during homologous recombination (PMID: 22193408). BRCA1 forms protein complexes with known tumor suppressors including RAD51, BRCA2, BARD1 and PALB2; specifically, BRCA1 and BARD1 facilitate resection of DNA ends and enhance the activity of the recombinase RAD51 (PMID: 14636569, 20729832, 20930833, 20871615, 20729858, 28976962). BRCA1 was the first breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene identified and cloned; inherited mutations in this gene lead to an increased lifetime risk of developing these cancers. BRCA1 mutations confer a 70-80% lifetime risk of breast cancer, a 50% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer and an increased risk of prostate cancer in patients with Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 founder mutations (PMID: 22193408). If one copy of BRCA1 is mutated in the germline, the result is hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease (PMID: 22193408). BRCA1 was also recently identified as a definitive Fanconi anemia susceptibility gene in FANCS, a rare Fanconi anemia subtype that results from biallelic mutations in the gene (PMID: 25472942). BRCA1 mutations are predicted to disrupt protein-protein interactions, which facilitate DNA repair (PMID: 1157308, 10918303). Mutations in TP53 in breast tumors are seen almost exclusively with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, suggesting that TP53 loss of function may be a necessary step in the tumorigenesis of BRCA-associated carcinomas (PMID: 14672397). PARP inhibitors are FDA-approved for patients with germline BRCA1-mutant ovarian and breast cancers (PMID: 25366685).",
    "BRCA2 deletions occur in some patients with breast cancer and are predicted to cause premature termination of translation and reduced protein expression (PMID: 22193408, 18501021, 16199546)",
    "(PMID: 22193408, 18501021, 16199546). Mice with BRCA2 deletions exhibit an increased susceptibility to mammary carcinomas ",
    ". Mice with BRCA2 deletions exhibit an increased susceptibility to mammary carcinomas (PMID: 12483515)",
    ". Additionally, loss of BRCA2 leads to genomic instability and the acquisition of further mutations (PMID: 27452521)",
    ". BRCA2 is essential for maintaining the integrity of homologous recombination during DNA damage response and inactivating mutations of this gene are associated with a significant increase in lifetime risk for the development of breast, ovarian, prostate or pancreatic cancers (PMID: 11239455, 22193408)",

    "BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 2) is a tumor suppressor gene that functions as a DNA repair protein. BRCA2 has been implicated in regulating diverse cellular processes including transcription, cell cycle regulation, and DNA damage response, with a particularly important role in DNA repair during homologous recombination (PMID: 22193408). BRCA2 forms protein complexes with known tumor suppressors including RAD51, BRCA1, and PALB2; specifically, BRCA2 binds single-stranded DNA and loads RAD51 monomers at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (PMID: 14636569, 20729832, 20930833, 20871615, 20729858, 28976962). RAD51 requires the BRCA1-BRCA2-PALB2 complex to initiate homologous recombination (PMID: 11239455). BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor protein; if one copy of the gene is inactivated in the germline, the result is hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease (PMID: 22193408, 15800615). BRCA2 was also identified as a definitive Fanconi anemia susceptibility gene that results from biallelic mutations in the gene (PMID: 12065746). Germline BRCA2 mutations confer a 50-60% lifetime risk of breast cancer, a 30% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, a 20-fold increased risk of prostate cancer, and a risk for the development of a broad range of cancers (PMID: 22193408, 31343663). Mutations in TP53 in breast tumors are seen almost exclusively with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, suggesting that TP53 loss of function may be a necessary step in the tumorigenesis of BRCA-associated carcinomas (PMID: 14672397). PARP inhibitors are FDA-approved for patients with germline BRCA2-mutant ovarian and breast cancers (PMID: 25366685).",
    "BRD3 (bromodomain containing 3) is a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) subfamily of bromodomain-containing proteins that regulate transcription through the recognition and binding of acetylated lysine residues on histones and transcription factors (PMID: 25849938, 31780938). BRD3 is an epigenetic reader (PMID: 31780938) and acts as a transcription regulator via association with the transcription factor GATA1 (PMID: 21536911). BRD3 has been shown to regulate processes such as skeletal myogenesis and erythroid maturation, among others (PMID: 28733670, 21536911). Translocations of BRD3 that fuse the gene to the 5' end of NUTM1 result in the oncogenic BRD3-NUTM1 fusion, which has been identified as a driver of NUT midline carcinoma (PMID: 25688404, 32328562). Inhibition of the BET protein family has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy across several cancer types (PMID: 25849938).",
    "Amplification of BRD4 occurs when multiple copies of the genome harboring the BRD4 gene are produced in the cell, resulting in multiple copies of the encoded protein. BRD4 overexpression in HeLa and NIH3T3 cells leads to dysregulated cell cycle as appropriate levels are required for cell cycle maintenance and progression (PMID: 19596781, 12192049, 15456879)",
    "(PMID: 19596781, 12192049, 15456879). Overexpression of BRD4 in HeLa cells leads to increased Pol II (Polymerase II) phosphorylation which can enhance transcriptional output and lead to aberrant gene expression ",

    "BRD4 is a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins, and is important in transcriptional activation and elongation at specific gene enhancer elements (PMID: 20871596). BRD4 binds to acetylated histone lysine motifs and helps recruit members of the transcriptional regulator complex, including P-TEFb and Mediator, which are necessary for PolII-dependent transcriptional elongation (PMID: 24751816). BRD4 has been shown to have a role in inflammation (PMID: 21068722, 25263595), viral gene expression (PMID: 16109376) and heart failure (PMID: 23911322). A subset of regulatory elements termed 'super-enhancers' are bound by high levels of BRD4 and are particularly prone to transcriptional perturbations of BRD4 inhibition (BETi) via small molecules (PMID: 24905006, 23582323). For example, BETi results in significant reduction of MYC downstream activity via its super-enhancer. As such, experimental data has shown that MYC-driven cancers are particularly sensitive to BETi, including multiple myeloma (PMID: 21889194) and medulloblastoma (PMID: 24297863). A chromosomal BRD4-NUT fusion product is a driver of disease in most cases of NUT midline carcinoma and is sensitive to BETi (PMID: 20871596). Resistance to BETi can arise due to BRD4 hyperphosphorylation in breast cancer (PMID: 26735014), and SPOP mutations, which can lead to BRD4 stabilization in prostate cancer (PMID: 28805820).",

    "BRIP1 (BACH1 and FANCJ) is a member of the RecQ DEAH helicase family. DEAH helicases participate in pre-messenger RNA splicing and ribosome biogenesis (PMID: 20168331). This family of genes includes those that have been implicated in heritable human diseases, including BLM, WRN and RECQL4 (PMID: 24606147). Specifically, BRIP1 interacts with the BRCT motif-containing domain of BRCA1 (PMID: 17033622). In the HCC1937 cell line that produces BRCA1 with a truncated C-terminal, BRIP1 failed to co-immunoprecipitate with BRCA1, suggesting this domain is important for interaction with BRIP1 (PMID: 11301010). In the same study, two intact BRCT repeat units on BRCA1 were shown to be necessary for the BRCA1 and BRIP1 interaction; a mutation at K52R on BRIP1 may control the interaction of the two proteins. BRIP1 has been shown to be mutated in hereditary breast (PMID: 11301010, 17033622), ovarian (PMID: 21964575) and prostate (PMID: 19127258) cancers as well as the Fanconi anemia (FA), a disorder caused by genetic defects in a number of proteins involved in DNA repair that is characterized by bone marrow failure, sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and the development of cancer, often acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (PMID: 24348213, 16493006). Cell lines that are deficient in BRIP1 are sensitive to mitomycin C, a crosslinking agent (PMID: 16153896).",
    "BRSK1 deletion mutations typically result in the loss of protein expression. In vitro studies with BRSK1-knockout MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrate that loss of BRSK1 is inactivating as measured by reduced CDKN1B expression and loss of cell cycle arrest compared to mock cells (PMID: 25036402)",
    "BRSK1 (Brain Specific Kinase 1, aka SAD-B) and its related isoform BRSK2 are AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) subfamily serine/threonine kinases that are phosphorylated by LKB1 and carry out tumor suppresive functions (PMID: 14976552). Activated BRSK1 regulates cell cycle progression by phosphorylating tubulin, which is critical for centrosome duplication (PMID: 19648910). Activated BRSK1 also phosphorylates and downregulates Wee1A and Cdc25-B/C, which regulates neuronal polarity and leads to G2/M arrest in response to UV- or MMS-induced DNA damage (PMID: 15705853, 20026642, 15150265). Truncating mutations of BRSK1 are found in MSI-high gastric and colorectal cancers (PMID: 27677186). Additionally, loss of BRSK1 expression in breast cancer has been associated with higher-grade disease (PMID: 25036402).",

    "BTG1 is a member of a family of proteins that regulate cell proliferation. BTG1 acts as an adaptor molecule that stimulates the activity of transcription factors including HOXB9 and RARα (PMID: 19746446). In addition, BTG1 regulates the activity of an epigenetic complex containing PRMT1, an arginine methyltransferase (PMID: 26657730). Expression of BTG1 is important for regulation of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cell proliferation in a variety of cellular contexts (PMID: 26622543). Deadenylation of poyl(A) tails on mRNA is also mediated by BTG1 binding to CNOT7, allowing for regulation of mRNA turnover and decay (PMID: 19746446). BTG1 transcriptional control is important for cerebellum and pre-B cell development as demonstrated in murine models (PMID: 27036158, 26524254). Loss of BTG1 enhances the stem cell renewal capacity of hematopoietic progenitor cells and mediates the upregulation of BCL6, leading to suppression of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and p19ARF (PMID: 29408281). Somatic BTG1 loss-of-function mutations occur in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and deletions occur in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (PMID: 22343534, 29407587, 27151989), suggesting that BTG1 functions as a tumor suppressor.

    "BTK (Bruton’s agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays an important role in B-cell activation. The B-cell receptor (BCR) activates BTK when BCR-associated tyrosine kinases (such as SYK and LYN) phosphorylate BTK at the plasma membrane (PMID: 8629002, 29861875). The main target of BTK phosphorylation is phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCγ2) which leads to the activation of downstream signaling pathways including NFAT, NFkB and MAPK pathways (PMID: 8691147, 10811867). BTK signaling is also implicated in chemokine receptor signaling in lymphocyte trafficking and in Toll-like receptor signaling in the immune response (PMID: 17239630, 23967355). Loss-of-function mutations in BTK result in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a disorder that results in the failure of pre-B cells in the bone marrow to differentiate into mature circulating B cells (PMID: 8380905). While somatic mutations in BTK are not common, BTK signaling is critical for growth of B-cell derived malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), multiple myeloma (MM) and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) (PMID: 24658273). BTK is also overexpressed in B-cell malignancies (PMID: 21422473, 23962569). BTK inhibition has been a successful means of therapy in hematologic malignancies. The tyrosine kinase ibrutinib targets BTK and is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with MCL, CLL, and WM (PMID: 25361916). However, acquired resistance to ibrutinib has been observed through mutations in BTK itself and in downstream effectors such as PLCγ2 (PMID: 24869598).",

Voltage-sensitive calcium channels, such as Cav1.3, function in mediating calcium ion entry into excitable cells to regulate calcium-dependent physiological processes (PMID: 29038230, 26842699, 23913004). CACNA1D directly interacts with the GABA(B) receptor to upregulate MAPK signaling pathways and regulate cellular proliferation (PMID: 22366257). The oncogenic function of CACNA1D may be tissue specific. CACNA1D overexpression and expression of CACNA1D gain-of-function alterations in prostate cancer and aldosterone-producing adenoma cell models induces increased cellular proliferation, suggesting that CACNA1D functions predominantly as an oncogene in these contexts (PMID: 36949059, 23913001, 28781648, 28584016). Amplification and activating mutations of CACNA1D have been identified in gastric cancer, prostate cancer and aldosterone-producing adenoma (PMID: 35590368, 36949059, 24054868, 23913004).

    "CALR, also known as calreticulin, is a calcium-binding protein located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the ER, the CALR protein has two primary functions: molecular chaperone in the protein-folding pathway and regulator of calcium homeostasis (PMID: 25918716). As a molecular chaperone, CALR acts to prevent the aggregation and export of partially or incorrectly folded proteins from the ER to the Golgi (PMID: 16467570). The activity of CALR and its paralog CNX (calnexin) is important to ensure the quality of glycoproteins, including membrane-bound proteins, transporters and certain secreted factors (PMID: 10567207). Additionally, CALR is localized to the nucleus and inhibits the function of nuclear hormone receptors, such as the androgen and glucocorticoid receptors, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (PMID: 8107808, 8107809, 7556879, 9013706, 7667104). CALR also has important roles in immune regulation including folding of MHC Class I molecules and serving as an “eat me” signal on cancer cells (PMID: 25918716). Recurrent somatic mutations in CALR have been identified in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms that lack alterations in JAK2 or MPL, suggesting a role in activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (PMID: 24325356, 24325359, 25873496). Alterations in CALR commonly occur as frameshift mutations in the C-terminal region of CALR, truncating the ER-targeting domain of the protein (PMID: 26951227). CALR mutations disrupt the interaction between CALR and membrane receptors (such as MPL) and activate downstream signaling pathways (PMID: 26951227). Somatic CALR mutations are also found in familial cases of thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis (PMID: 24553179).",

    "CARD11 (caspase recruitment domain 11) is a cytoplasmic scaffold protein that functions in mediating apoptosis and NF-ĸB signaling via the CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) complex (PMID: 11278692). Upregulation of CARD11 by protein kinase C (PKC) leads to a conformational change of the protein and formation of the CBM complex, resulting in activation of NF-ĸB through the IĸB kinase (PMID: 26260210, 26212909). In mouse B-cells, CARD11 is a molecular switch defining either the occurrence of activation-induced cell death or proliferation and plasmablast differentiation (PMID: 23027925). CARD11 is an oncogene, and constitutive activation of the CBM complex is a common feature of B- and T-cell malignancies, particularly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma where gain-of-function mutations in CARD11 have been identified (PMID: 18323416).",

    "CASP8 is a cysteine protease that is a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family. CASP8 functions as the main initiator caspase that mediates death receptor-induced apoptosis (PMID: 9729047). Proteolytic activation of CASP8 is induced by the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) involving CD95 (Fas/Apo1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors and TNF receptors (PMID: 25617598, 18073771).

    "The CD274 gene encodes programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a member of a family of co-stimulatory immune receptor ligands. PD-L1 acts to inhibit an immune response by binding to the PD-1 cell surface receptor, which is expressed by T cells, B cells and natural killer cells (PMID: 17629517). PD-L1 allows tumor cells to evade the host immune system by suppressing the T cell response. Amplification or overexpression of PD-L1 has been identified in some tumor types and can be predictive of responses to immunotherapy (PMID: 22437870, 26918453, 28652380, 27620277), suggesting that PD-L1 functions as an oncogene. Individuals with tumors expressing PD-L1 should be considered for immune checkpoint therapy. Atezolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (PMID: 28424325) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy (PMID: 28611199). Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, is considered first-line therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanomas that express PD-L1, and may be efficacious in other tumors that express PD-L1 (PMID: 28806116). Nivolumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody that targets PD-1, is also effective in tumors with high PD-L1 expression due to the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and activation of a robust immune response (PMID: 28806116).",
    "CD276 (also B7-H3 and B7RP-2) is an immune checkpoint molecule and member of the B7 immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins (PMID: 27208063). CD276 is a transmembrane protein found in various cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and osteoclasts; however, post-transcriptional mechanisms reduce the steady-state levels of CD276 protein (PMID: 27208063). Expression of CD276 is also found on antigen-presenting cells in response to inflammation, including on dendritic and natural killer cells, which likely play important roles in T-cell mediated immune response (PMID: 27208063, 22437870, 11224528, 12925852). Loss of CD276 in murine models results in overactivation of the immune system, demonstrating that CD276 negatively regulates T-cell proliferation (PMID: 12925852). CD276 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and has been associated with cancer progression and immune evasion (PMID: 24892449, 22473715, 16489649, 18042703, 23940627, 21671471, 31075138). In addition, CD276 is overexpressed on the cell surface of cancer cells and dampens T-cell inhibitory responses, including in pediatric brain tumors (PMID: 32341579, 29860983). Immunotherapies targeting CD276, such as monoclonal antibodies and engineered CAR T-cell therapy, are currently under clinical investigation (PMID: 30753824, 30655315, 22615450, 29914796, 32398947).",
    "CD28 is a costimulatory receptor required for T cell activation and survival (PMID: 27192564). CD28 is expressed predominantly on T cells and mediates various T cell processes including differentiation, survival, cytokine production, and immune homeostasis (PMID: 27192564, 29163534). The pairing of CD28 with a B7 protein presented on an antigen presenting cell enhances the activity of MHC (major histocompatibility complex)-TCR (T cell receptor signal) complexes and CD28-B7 coupling is required to initiate a T cell response (PMID: 8642283). The ligands that bind CD28 are CD86, which is constitutively expressed on antigen presenting cells, and CD80, which is upregulated after CD28-CD80 binding (PMID: 27192564, 14978077). CTLA4 and CD28 compete for the same ligands, and subsequent CD80 upregulation following CD28 stimulation may promote immune suppression (PMID: 7682233, 27192564). CD28 is expressed on other immune cells, including plasma cells and T regulatory cells, and plays a role in antibody production and the inflammatory response (PMID: 7534672, 12616483). CD28 engagement initiates several signal transduction pathways due to the association of signaling molecules with the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 (PMID: 8067997, 8025954). CD28 function is dysregulated in autoimmune disorders and cancers (PMID: 28711152, 27460989). CD28 agonists and antagonists are FDA-approved for a variety of immune-related disorders to modulate the function of T effector and T regulatory cells (PMID: 27192564).",
    "Deletions in CD58 have been identified in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and other lymphomas. These alterations are predicted to contribute to immune evasion and are associated with poor prognosis in patients with lymphoma (PMID: 26194173, 22137796, 24413734, 27825110)",

    "CD58 (also LFA-3) is a cell surface ligand that functions as an immune cell adhesion molecule. CD58 binds CD2, a receptor expressed on T lymphocytes, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, to promote cell adhesion to target cells and to provide a stimulatory signal for T cells (PMID: 2951597, 29564225). Co-stimulation resulting from CD2-CD58 engagement results in proliferation, cytokine production and effector function in immune cells (PMID: 26041540). Antibodies targeting CD58 result in blunted immune recognition and reduced cytolysis of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells in preclinical studies (PMID: 3084649). CD58 expression is reduced in some acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphomas, resulting in tumor cells lacking the necessary cell surface molecules for immune recognition (PMID: 22137796, 24413734). Somatic mutations and deletions in CD58 have been identified in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and other lymphomas, contributing to immune evasion (PMID: 26194173, 22137796, 24413734, 27825110). In DLBCL, concurrent downregulation of both CD58 and HLA-1 molecules results in immune escape from T and NK cells (PMID: 22137796).",
    "CD74, a member of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II family, encodes for an invariant chain that functions primarily in antigen presentation for the generation of CD4+ T-cell immune responses (PMID: 30723591). CD74 also functions as a cell surface receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor, which induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine response (PMID: 32004754, 12782713). Overexpression of CD74 in various cancer cell lines and models induces xenograft tumor growth and increases actin polymerization, suggesting that CD74 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 27626171). Amplification of CD74 has been identified in various types of cancer, including gastrointestinal cancer, glioma and thyroid carcinoma (PMID: 21228923, 34540893, 25600560). CD74 expression is a potential therapeutic target with preclinical studies and clinical trials investigating the efficacy of anti-CD74 inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates in various types of cancer (PMID: 25600560, 23427296, 22611320, 28466956, 36634212).",
    "CD79A is a surface immunoglobulin protein that forms a complex with CD79B and composes part of the B-cell receptor (BCR) (PMID: 1439759). CD79A is expressed from an early stage of B-cell development until the final stage of maturation prior to differentiation into plasma cells (PMID: 21841126, 24146823). The CD79A/CD79B complex is important for transmitting signals generated by antigen binding to the BCR into the cell to support B-cell maturation and survival (PMID: 15186779). Following BCR-ligand interaction, CD79A and CD79B are phosphorylated and activated by SRC family kinases leading to activation of downstream oncogenic signaling cascades that affect B-cell maturation (PMID: 17114463, 15699130, 20940318, 22078222, 11514602). Activating mutations in CD79A have been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, particularly the activated B-cell-like subtype (PMID: 20054396), suggesting that CD79A acts as an oncogene. Such aberrations result in increased BCR signaling and ligand-independent clustering of BCRs, resulting in enhanced B-cell survival and differentiation. Antibody-drug conjugates targeting CD79A/B and inhibitors targeting SRC activity, such as dasatinib, can reduce BCR signaling (PMID: 17374736, 20054396).",

    "CD79B is a surface immunoglobulin that forms a complex with CD79A to form a component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) (PMID: 1439759). The CD79 (Iga/Igb) complex is important for signaling from the BCR to support maturation and survival of B-cells throughout development (PMID: 15186779, 8602530). The cytoplasmic portion of CD79B contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) domains that become phosphorylated by SRC proto-oncogene family protein kinases. These regions serve as docking sites for signaling complex formation with kinases such as SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) and for signal regulation (PMID: 17114463, 20940318, 22078222). Activating mutations of CD79B have been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, particularly the activated B-cell-like subtype (PMID: 20054396) suggesting that CD79B acts as an oncogene. CD79B mutations result in increased surface BCR expression, reduced BCR internalization and dampening of LYN (Lyn proto-oncogene) kinase feedback inhibition, thus resulting in increased BCR signaling. Somatic mutation in the protein's ITAM domain have also been identified and shown to affect signaling (PMID: 20054396). Germline CD79B mutation leads to agammaglobulinemia, a severe immunodeficiency syndrome with B-cell dysfunction (PMID: 17709424). Antibody-drug conjugates targeting CD79B and inhibitors targeting SRC activity, such as dasatinib, can reduce BCR signaling (PMID: 17374736, 20054396, 25925619, 28009435).",
    "CDC42 is a small GTPase that localizes to the plasma membrane of the cell. CDC42 can switch between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, transducing signals to a variety of downstream effectors (PMID: 21115489). CDC42 plays a role in cell polarization, chemotaxis, migration and mitosis (PMID: 14978216, 15642749, 17038317, 26689677). In cancer, CDC42 overexpression has been associated with enhanced proliferation and invasion, suggesting an oncogenic role; however, a tumor suppressor function related to cell polarity maintenance has also been observed (PMID: 21515363). Mutations and copy number alterations of CDC42 are rare events in cancer. CDC42, as well as other Rho GTPases (e.g., Ras oncoproteins), are difficult targets for pharmacological intervention, although some CDC42-specific drugs exist (PMID: 21433396).",

    "CDH1, also known as E-cadherin, is a calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein that is mainly expressed in epithelial cells and functions in cell-cell adhesion, signaling cascades and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (PMID: 18726070). The extracellular portion of E-cadherin facilitates homophilic cell-to-cell adhesion by binding to cadherins on adjacent cells, while the intracellular domain is tethered to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with catenins and functions to activate signaling cascades that play a role in the EMT (PMID: 7885471, 2788574). The transcription factor SNAIL, a key regulator of the EMT during embryonic development, represses expression of the E-cadherin gene in tumor cell lines (PMID: 10655586, 10655587). Lack of E-cadherin function/expression enables cancer progression by altering cellular morphology, decreasing cellular adhesion, and increasing cellular motility (PMID: 10439038, 2070412, 9515965). Along with point mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), epigenetic silencing by hypermethylation of the CDH1 promoter has been associated with the loss of E-cadherin gene expression during cancer progression (PMID: 7543680). Individuals with a germline CDH1 mutation have an increased risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer and breast cancer (PMID: 11729114). Loss of E-cadherin has also been demonstrated in a variety of sporadic cancer types including gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and esophageal cancer (PMID: 11313896, 22716209, 21373750).",

Recurrent inactivating CDK12 mutations in metastatic prostate and serous ovarian cancers have been observed (PMID: 28843286). CDK12 interacts with and phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP) in vitro (PMID: 11683387) and complexes with Cyclin K to maintain genomic stability via regulation of the expression of DNA damage response genes, such as BRCA1, ATR, FANCI and FANCD2. Loss of the CDK12/cyclin K complex renders HEK293 cells sensitive to various DNA damaging agents, including camptothecin, etoposide and mitomycin C (PMID: 22012619, 24662513). CDK12 is one of the most frequently somatically mutated genes in ovarian cancer (PMID: 21720365), which is consistent with its role in the maintenance of genomic stability.

Upon mitogen stimulation, CDK4 forms a complex with cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), which leads to activation of the kinases (PMID: 12432268). The active CDK4/CDK6 complex then phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma (RB), thereby inducing the gene expression program regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors, which is important in cell cycle progression. CDK4/6 are in turn negatively regulated by p16INK4a (CDKN2A), which binds to the catalytic domains of the kinases and interferes with cyclin D and ATP binding (PMID: 9751050, 11124804).

    ". CDK6 knockdown experiments demonstrated that CDK6 is the major regulator of cellular proliferation in MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, hence suggesting that up-regulation of CDK6 expression may be a tumor-promoting event in leukemia (PMID: 24736461, 24764564)",
    ". Mechanistically, it is believed that the increased availability of CDK6 results in the formation of CDK4/6-cyclin D complexes that are able to overcome p16-mediated inhibition and lead to cell cycle progression.",
    "CDK6 (cyclin-dependent kinase 6) is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates the cell cycle G1 to S phase transition. Upon mitogen stimulation, CDK4 forms a complex with Cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), which leads to activation of the kinases (PMID: 12432268). The active complex then phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma (RB), thus leading to the induction of a gene expression program regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors, which is important in cell cycle progression (PMID: 12432268). CDK4/6 are in turn negatively regulated by p16INK4a (CDKN2A), which binds to the catalytic domains of the kinases and interferes with cyclin D and ATP binding (PMID: 9751050, 11124804). Amplification and overexpression of CDK6 occur in several cancer types, such as esophageal carcinoma, leukemia and lymphoma (PMID: 24423610, 9422538, 16782810). CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in certain solid tumors, including breast and non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 27959613, 27217383). Furthermore, CDK4/6 inhibition can trigger anti-tumor immunity by promoting cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance of tumor cells (PMID: 28813415).",
    "CDK8 amplification refers to the presence of multiple copies of the CDK8 gene due to copy number gain that leads to the overexpression of the encoded protein. Knockdown of CDK8 in multiple cell line models with high CDK8 expression inhibited cell proliferation. CDK8 kinase activity was necessary for β-catenin-driven signaling and transformation and CDK8 was found to drive expression of the oncogene, MYC, in a β-catenin-dependent manner. In addition, overexpression of wildtype CDK8 in immortal murine fibroblast (NIH 3T3) cells induced focus formation, anchorage-independent colony growth, and tumor formation in immuno deficient animals, whereas expression of a kinase-dead CDK8 variant did not. These observations confirm that CDK8 overexpression is oncogenic (PMID: 18794900)",
    "CDK8 (cyclin-dependent kinase 8) is a serine/threonine kinase that is an important regulator of DNA transcription and cell cycle progression. CDK8 associates with Cyclin C (CCNC), Med12 and Med13 to form a module that associates with the Mediator complex, which is involved in the regulation of DNA transcription (PMID: 7568034). CDK8 associates and phosphorylates the c-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, and thus plays an important role in transcriptional elongation (PMID: 10023686, 11278802). CDK8 is a positive regulator of oncogene-induced proliferation and enables efficient transcriptional elongation through recruitment of pTEF-B and BRD4 to oncogenic genes (PMID: 20098423). However, CDK8 has been shown to restrain Mediator-dependent super-enhancer driven transcription in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID: 26416749), and thus may have different roles in certain oncogenic contexts. CDK8 is amplified in a large number of colorectal cancers and was specifically shown to modulate beta-catenin activity in this context (PMID: 18794900).",

    "The CDKN1A gene encodes the p21 (WAF1) protein, which is a member of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. p21 inhibits the cyclin-dependent kinases CDC2 and CDK2, leading to G1 phase cell cycle arrest. p21 expression is upregulated by DNA damage through a p53-dependent mechanism (PMID: 8242752). Moreover, activation of the PI3K/AKT mitogenic signaling pathway results in phosphorylation and localization of p21 to the cytoplasm where it can no longer access its CDK targets, leading to enhanced cell proliferation. p21 may play a role in repair of DNA damage through interactions with DNA polymerase accessory factors. Loss of p21 can lead to chromosomal aneuploidy, implying a role in mitotic regulation. p21 expression is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and protein levels: tumor suppressors and oncoproteins modulate transcription of CDKN1A while post-translational p21 modification regulates proteasomal degradation and subcellular localization (PMID: 9296497, 10319992). The majority of p21 alterations in cancer are truncating, concurrent with its role as a tumor suppressor, and p21 knockout mouse models display an increased incidence of a variety of cancers as compared to mice with intact p21 expression (PMID: 7664346, 12810620). p21 also exhibits anti-apoptotic activity in certain contexts, suggesting that it also possesses an oncogenic role. Inhibitors targeting the checkpoint kinase Chk1 in combination with chemotherapy have been found to have anti-tumor activity in bladder cancer (PMID: 25349305).",

The p27 protein is ubiquitously expressed and located both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (PMID: 8033212). Nuclear p27 functions as a tumor suppressor by controlling cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, specifically by inhibiting the binding of cyclins A and E to CDK2 (PMID: 18354415). Conversely, cytoplasmic p27 may have a pro-oncogenic role by stimulating cell migration through mechanisms largely independent of its CDK-inhibiting function (PMID: 15573116, 17909030). The activity of p27 is largely regulated by protein degradation, and proteolysis is triggered by its CDK-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination by SCF complexes (PMID: 16633365). Germline mutations in p27 can cause a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome (PMID: 17030811). Low p27 levels due to increased protein degradation are prevalent in several different types of epithelial tumors, such as cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, skin, hematopoietic malignancies, gliomas, and sarcomas, and are commonly correlated with aggressive tumor growth and poor clinical outcome (PMID: 15573116, 10699961).",

    "CEBPA is a transcription factor that is a member of the basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) protein family (PMID: 25753223). CEBPA exists as two isoforms (p42 and p30) and binds DNA as a homodimer or heterodimer (as a p42/p30 heterodimer or in complex with other transcription factors, such as AP-1) to activate transcription (PMID: 25753223, 18026136). Through interactions via the transactivation domain, CEBPA can help recruit RNA polymerase II, coactivators such as CBP (Creb binding protein)/p300, and chromatin-modifying complexes such as SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose nonfermentable) (PMID: 12857754, 14660596). CEBPA functions as a regulator of cellular identity and coordinates the differentiation of diverse cell types including hematopoietic, adipose, and epithelial cells (PMID: 7652557, 23160954, 12757710). In hematopoiesis, CEBPA is important for the development of the myeloid lineage and granulocytic differentiation by regulating specific growth factor receptors and cell cycle arrest (PMID: 25753223). Loss of CEBPA in several cell types results in aberrant gene expression changes and cancer progression (PMID: 17638888).

Centromeric chromatin has distinct properties including flexible histone tails, which preclude the binding of histone H1, a histone molecule important in heterochromatin formation (PMID: 27499292, 32516549). CENPA is only present at centromeres and is essential for the correct assembly of proteins at the kinetochore, for centromere activity, and for chromosome segregation (PMID: 12906131, 10655499, 15870271, 27499292).

    "CHEK2 (Checkpoint Kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an integral role in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway and prevents damaged cells from continuing through the cell cycle. In response to DNA damage, CHEK2 is activated by the kinases ATR and ATM via phosphorylation (PMID: 12781359). Once activated, CHEK2 acts as an effector kinase, mediating downstream signaling that leads to a diverse range of cellular responses, including cell cycle checkpoint activation, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair and/or apoptosis (PMID: 25404613). CHEK2 also plays an important role during mitosis by maintaining chromosomal stability (PMID: 24798733, 20364141). Given its role in maintaining genomic stability, CHEK2 alterations are found in a range of cancers including glioblastoma, breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, gastric, thyroid, and lung cancer (PMID: 23296741, 24713400, 25583358, 12052256, 15125777). Germline mutations in CHEK2 have been associated with an increased risk of breast, prostate, and colon cancers (PMID: 21701879, 12533788, 17106448).",
    "CHTF8 loss is an alteration frequently identified in renal and prostate cancer, and is associated with poor patient prognosis (PMID: 12477976)",

    "The CHTF8 gene, also known as DERPC, encodes the CTF8 subunit of the CTF18 replication factor C (RFC) complex, a proliferating cell nuclear antigen loader that functions in sister chromatid cohesion (PMID: 20826785). CTF8, along with the subunits CTF18 and DCC1, form a trimeric complex to mediate binding to DNA polymerase ε to promote polymorphic modulation of DNA synthesis (PMID: 20826785). Deletion of CHTF8 by itself and in combination with the other subunits of the RFC complex in yeast demonstrate severe defects in sister chromatid cohesion and G2/M cell cycle accumulation (PMID: 11389843). In vitro studies with prostate tumor cell lines and kidney embryonic cell lines demonstrate that CHTF8 expression is significantly reduced in prostate and renal cancer, respectively (PMID: 12477976). Similarly, overexpression of CHTF8 in prostate tumor cell lines demonstrates prostate cancer growth suppression as measured by inhibition of colony growth (PMID: 12477976).",
    "The CIC-DUX4 fusion retains the majority of the CIC protein and includes the C-terminal region of DUX4, however, it cleaves off both DUX4 homeobox domains (PMID: 21813156)",
    ". The chimeric protein resulting from CIC-DUX4 fusion has transforming properties in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. Compared to wildtype CIC, the fusion mediates transcriptional activation instead of repression of downstream CIC targets, leading to upregulation of the ETS PEA3 subfamily that is normally repressed by CIC; this is likely the cause of its oncogenic activity (PMID: 22072439, 16717057)",
    "CIC (also Capicua) is a transcriptional repressor that is a member of the high mobility (HMG)-box protein family (PMID: 32073140). CIC is expressed in a variety of tissues and is a critical regulator of patterning, differentiation, and signaling (PMID: 10652276, 32073140). Chromatin modifiers, such as the Sin/HDAC3 histone deacetylase complex, are recruited to sites bound by CIC to inhibit gene expression of target genes (PMID: 29844126). CIC exists in diverse protein complexes including with ATXN1, which directly binds CIC and modulates its transcriptional repressor activity (PMID: 17190598). The CIC-ATXN1 complex regulates the expression of several transcription factors, including members of the ETS protein family (PMID: 27869830). Loss of CIC expression results in the derepression of ETS transcriptional regulators, such as ETV4, which can activate extracellular remodeling programs and metastasis (PMID: 27869830, 22014525). In addition, CIC is a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and MAPK signaling pathways and acts as a transcriptional repressor in the absence of RTK signaling (PMID: 11714680, 11861482, 29844126, 28178529). CIC is recurrently mutated in oligodendrogliomas, including in 1p/19q-deleted cancers (PMID: 21817013, 22869205, 22588899). Somatic mutations and deletions have also been found in various other cancer types, including in lung and gastric cancers (PMID: 25079317, 27869830). Chromosomal translocations that produce chimeric CIC proteins fused to several partner proteins, including DUX4 or FOXO4, occur in aggressive round cell sarcomas and result in aberrant CIC-mediated transcriptional activation (PMID: 19837261, 25007147, 21813156).",

    "CIITA is a transcriptional coactivator that functions as a master regulator of the genes that encode the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) proteins (PMID: 24391648). MHC class II proteins present extracellular peptides on the surface of antigen presenting cells to display these peptides to the immune system. CIITA is constitutively expressed in cell types that express MHC class II molecules, including dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells (PMID: 25324123). CIITA and MHC class II expression can be induced in other immune cell types by IFNγ and stimulation with other cytokines (PMID: 25324123). CIITA has multifaceted roles in transcriptional regulation including replacement of the TFIID component in the general transcriptional complex as well as acetyltransferase and kinase activity, which are necessary for the transcription of MHC class I and class II genes (PMID: 24391648). CIITA requires the DNA binding proteins CREB, RFX, and NF-Y to serve as a binding scaffold (PMID: 16730065). Germline mutations in CIITA have been identified in patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome type II, an immune deficiency that leads to a loss of MHC class II protein surface expression (PMID: 7749985). Rearrangements involving CIITA are found in patients with B cell and Hodgkin lymphoma (PMID: 21368758). CIITA fusion proteins cause downregulation of MHC class II expression and overexpression of ligands for PD-1, a receptor that mediates immune suppression (PMID: 21368758). Somatic CIITA loss-of-function mutations and deletions have been associated with some lymphomas, suggesting that CIITA functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 28479318, 26599546, 26549456).",

    "CMTR2 (also FTSJD1 and HMTR2) is an RNA methyltransferase that modifies the 5’ cap structures of messenger RNA (mRNA). CMTR2 catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group to the 2'-O-ribose on the second nucleotide in the mRNA (cap2) (PMID: 24402442, 21310715). The 5’ cap of mRNA is modified by methylation on both the first and second nucleotide, which is important for effective processing, translation initiation, gene expression, splicing, and stability of mRNA (PMID: 24402442, 15525712). In addition, 2'-O-ribose methylation is important for immune recognition of mRNA transcripts in the host cell (PMID: 21217758).

As a co-factor, CREBBP binds to DNA binding proteins where it functions as a scaffold to recruit a range of transcription complex components (PMID: 9215639, 9445474). CREBBP itself can recruit the basal transcriptional machinery, and through its HAT activity acetylate lysine tails to modify chromatin into a more open conformation for active transcription (PMID: 8576192, 8967953). The HAT activity of CREBBP is also active on non-histone proteins, including tumor suppressors such as p53 and tissue-specific transcription factors such as GATA1 (PMID: 9830059, 9859997). In leukemias, CREBBP can be disrupted by translocations that fuse the HAT domain with the MOZ/KAT6A (lysine acetyltransferase 6a) protein t(8;16) (PMID: 9447825).

The binding of CSDE1 regulates numerous mRNA targets, including poly(A) binding protein (PABP), MYC and FOS (PMID: 16356927, 31027221). Because CSDE1 is involved in numerous RNA regulatory protein complexes, CSDE1 modulates a variety of cellular processes including apoptosis, neuronal development, cell cycle progression, invasion and sex chromosome dosage compensation (PMID: 31579823, 24012837, 17159903, 11313462). In addition, CSDE1 regulates processes important in protein translation including deadenylation (PMID: 11051545, 15314026). Loss-of-function mutations in CSDE1 have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (PMID: 31579823). Deletions and loss-of-function alterations have been identified in patients with rare neuroendocrine tumors, including pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PMID: 28162975). In addition, CSDE1 may function as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in several cancer types (PMID: 31027221, 27908735, 28162975, 29422612).",

    "CSF1R is a membrane protein that acts as a receptor for colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1), a cytokine that regulates the production, differentiation, and function of macrophages. CSF1R-mediated signaling is an important regulator of innate immunity. Co-expression of CSF1R and the ligand CSF1 can lead to tumorigenic activity in cancer cells independent of CSF1R overexpression or amplification, suggesting that CSF1R acts as an oncogene (PMID: 22096574). However, loss-of-function CSF1R mutations and splice variants have also been associated with a predisposition for myeloid malignancies (PMID: 18971950). Kinase inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies that target CSF1R have been shown to effectively target CSF1/CSF1R signaling, resulting in a reduction in the number of tumor-associated macrophages. Experimental data suggest that CSF1/CSF1R blockade could improve the efficacy of immunotherapies by enhancing activation of T cells in the tumor microenvironment.

    "If the Oncogenic Mutations occur at CSF3R, could lead ton Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia",
    "CSF3R (also G-CSF) is a transmembrane receptor for cytokine colony-stimulating factor 3. Activation of the receptor is associated with the increased production of neutrophilic granulocytes and has been used clinically to shorten recovery time for chemotherapy and to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells into the periphery for stem cell collection (PMID: 7521686, 3311216, 7534140). Signaling from the receptor is mediated by JAK (Janus kinase) and SRC (SRC proto-oncogene) family of kinases with downstream activation of STAT, PI3K, and MAPK signaling cascades (PMID: 7579336, 9590246) and inhibition mediated through the SOCS (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling) proteins and tyrosine phosphatases (PMID: 12133942, 9590246). Loss of function mutations can lead to severe congenital neutropenia (PMID: 10449521, 24753537). Activating mutations can cause receptor dimerization independent of ligand with mutations near the juxtamembrane region, or truncate the receptor leading to altered signal transduction (PMID: 23739288, 8246993). These mutations have been found in myeloid disorders such as chronic neutrophilic leukemia, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 7542747, 23656643). Solid tumors have been shown to express CSF3R that may be important for disease phenotype or transformation (PMID: 16912178, 25908586).",

    ". While complete loss of CTCF is embryonic lethal, CTCF haploinsufficiency has been demonstrated to alter global methylation patterns, predispose mice to a range of cancers and is associated with shortened overall lifespan (PMID: 24794443)",
    "CTCF is a versatile regulator of gene transcription that binds DNA with different combinations of its eleven highly conserved zinc finger (ZF) domains. CTCF can recruit histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or histone deacetylases (HDACs), along with other cofactors, and activate or repress transcription, respectively (PMID: 11525835, 10734189). The c-MYC oncogene is a well-known CTCF target, which acts in this context as a transcriptional repressor (PMID: 8649389). CTCF also acts as an insulator, playing a role in high order chromatin structural organization and long-range genomic interactions (PMID: 23498937), typically isolating enhancers from promoters which ultimately results in inhibition of gene transcription (PMID: 19846290, 25002401). Insulation is achieved by CTCF-mediated modification of epigenetic marks, such as H3K27me3 removal (PMID: 25294833). CTCF binding prevents CpG methylation and vice versa (PMID: 20591991, 25703332). While complete loss of CTCF is embryonically lethal, CTCF haploinsufficiency has been demonstrated to alter global methylation patterns, predispose mice to a range of cancers and is associated with shortened overall lifespan (PMID: 24794443). Mutations in the CTCF gene usually result in a truncated protein, and they are mainly found in carcinomas of the endometrium (15%), digestive tract (colon and stomach, around 5%) and breast (cBioPortal, MSKCC, March 2015). In addition, both CTCF loss and overexpression lead to global effects in expression profiles.",

CTLA4 binds to ligand B7-1 and B7-2, present on antigen presenting cells (PMID: 7543139). Binding of these ligands prevents their binding to CD28, the co-stimulatory molecule on T-cells and transduces an inhibitory signal within the T-cell (PMID: 11244047). Germline mutations in CTLA4 lead to immune dysregulation, hyper-activated T-cells and loss of normal circulating B-cells (PMID: 25213377). Polymorphisms and mutations in CTLA4 are associated with autoimmune diseases, including thyroid disorders and diabetes (PMID: 25695113, 25329329). Inhibition of CTLA4 has been employed in immune therapy of cancer by allowing activation of tumor-specific T-cells (PMID: 20525992).

    "CTNNA1 encodes for a catenin which functions in association with a variety of cadherins to promote cell-adhesion (PMID: 11997091). The intracellular adhesion function of CTNNA1 is regulated through a dual-kinase mechanism located on the carboxy-terminal region and phospho-linker region of the protein (PMID: 25653389). CTNNA1 forms part of the E-cadherin/catenin multiprotein complex and promotes adhesion junction through interaction between other catenins and the actin cytoskeleton (PMID: 34425242, 9819562). Inactivation of CTNNA1 in various types of cancer cell lines and models induces cellular invasiveness and tumor metastasis, suggesting that CTNNA1 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 33057364, 17223851, 29484367, 33364826).

    "CTNNB1 (also β-catenin) is a transcriptional activator involved in the WNT signaling pathway (PMID: 22682243, 22617422). In the absence of WNT ligands, β-catenin is sequestered in the cytosol by its interaction with the APC/AXIN destruction complex. This destruction complex includes GSK3β, a kinase responsible for phosphorylating key β-catenin residues and targeting β-catenin for degradation. Engagement of WNT receptors by WNT ligands results in disruption of the APC/AXIN destruction complex, freeing β-catenin to transit into the nucleus and mediate target gene activation by interaction with transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family. Important transcriptional targets of β-catenin/TCF include Cyclin D1 and MYC (PMID: 10201372, 9727977). β-catenin also influences cell-cell adhesion and cell migration (PMID: 15001769). Somatic gain-of-function mutations in CTNNB1 result in aberrant accumulation of the β-catenin protein and are prevalent in a wide range of solid tumors, including uterine/endometrial carcinoma (PMID: 9721853, 23636398), ovarian (PMID: 19349352, 20942669), hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 22634756, 23788652), and colorectal carcinoma (PMID: 22810696), among others. Cancers with CTNNB1 mutations are presumed to be resistant to pharmacologic inhibition of upstream components of the WNT pathway, instead requiring direct inhibition of β-catenin function (PMID: 19351922, 22682243).",
    "CTR9 truncating mutations typically result in the loss of protein function. Truncating mutations of CTR9 have been identified in Wilms' tumor (PMID: 29292210)",
    ". In vivo studies with yeast expressing truncated variants of CTR9 demonstrate that truncating mutations are inactivating as measured by loss of binding with PAF1c compared to full length CTR9 (PMID: 30228257)",
    "CTR9 is an adaptor protein that is a component of the transcriptional regulatory PAF1 complex (PAF1c) (PMID: 20060942). CTR9 binds the multimeric PAF1c, which is also composed of the proteins PAF1, LEO1, CDC73, RTF1, and WDR61 (PMID: 25099282, 11884586, 30228257). PAF1c binds RNA polymerase II (Pol II) via the C-terminal domain (CTD) in the unphosphorylated state and dynamically regulates transcription at various stages including initiation, termination, elongation, and polyadenylation (PMID: 25099282, 11884586). In addition to regulating the activity of Pol II, PAF1c and CTR9 function to recruit transcription factors, histone remodelers, and processing factors to chromatin, thereby regulating gene expression via various layers of regulation (PMID: 20060942). The activity of CTR9 and PAF1c coordinate the appropriate placement of histone marks, allowing for regulation of chromatin remodeling (PMID: 22982193). The PAF1c complex also mediates the eviction of Pol II from chromatin in response to DNA damage, implicating the transcriptional complex in mediating genome instability (PMID: 26798134). PAF1c function is ubiquitously expressed to coordinate gene expression; however, PAF1c activity is particularly important during development (PMID: 17721442) and for the maintenance of embryonic stem cell identity (PMID: 19345177). Germline mutations in CTR9 are found in patients with Wilms’ tumor, a childhood renal cancer (PMID: 25099282). CTR9 alterations are predominantly heterozygous and alter CTR9 splicing, likely leading to protein truncation and loss of activity, suggesting that CTR9 acts predominantly as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 25099282, 29292210). However, in breast cancer, CTR9 expression is associated with increased transcription of oncogenic genes and proliferation, demonstrating a context-specific growth-promoting role of CTR9 (PMID: 26494790, 27829357).",

    "CUL3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is a member of the cullin protein family (PMID: 27200299). Cullins, such as CUL3, associate with RING domain proteins to form E3 ligase complexes, which covalently attach ubiquitin to target proteins for subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome (PMID: 15071497). CUL3 functions as a scaffolding protein with BTB-domain adaptor proteins to bring target substrates in proximity to the catalytic RING domain (PMID: 17120193). CUL3 is also involved in many cellular processes including the maturation of endosomes associated with lysosomal degradation, inflammation, proliferation, and cell cycle progression (PMID: 22219362, 30872636, 27200299). In addition, CUL3 interacts with several substrate adaptors that are altered in cancer including KEAP1, KLHL20, and SPOP (PMID: 27200299). A prominent example is KEAP1, which recruits the oxidative stress signaling factor NRF2 to the CUL3-containing E3-ubiquitin ligase complex for degradation (PMID: 19321346, 19638449, 23365135). Germline mutations in CUL3 are found in patients with Gordon’s syndrome, which is characterized by hypertension (PMID: 23689903). Somatic loss-of-function mutations in CUL3 have been identified in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 31548347). These alterations disrupt the degradation of NRF2 and subsequently upregulate the oxidative stress response via KEAP1 and NRF2, leading to cancer progression (PMID: 19321346, 19638449, 23365135).",

Germline mutations in CYP19A1 result in aromatase excess and deficiency syndromes, which can result in early puberty, breast hypertrophy, and abnormal virilization (PMID: 12736278, 8530621). Patients with ER+ (estrogen receptor-positive) breast cancers may receive adjuvant endocrine therapy which may include aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole, exemestane, and anastrozole (PMID: 14668813). Several mechanisms of aromatase-based resistance have been identified, including amplification and mutation of CYP19A1 in patients with ER+ breast cancers (PMID: 14668813, 28112739, 24242068). CYP19A1 activity has also been implicated in several other hormone-positive cancers including endometrial cancers and cholangiocarcinomas (PMID: 27067638, 30284180).",
    "The CYSLTR2 L129Q mutation is located in the transmembrane domain of the CYSLTR2 protein. This mutation has been found in uveal melanoma (PMID: 27089179)",
    ". In vitro studies have demonstrated that this mutation is likely activating as measured by increased cellular growth and pigmentation compared to wildtype (PMID: 27089179)",
    "CYSLTR2 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is a member of the rhodopsin-like GPCR family (PMID: 16776669, 13679572). CYSTLTR2 is activated by cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), which are inflammatory lipid mediators that are involved in allergic processes (PMID: 16776669, 13679572). Activation of Gαq proteins (such as GNAQ and GNA11) by CYSLTR2 promotes Gαq-mediated GDP/GTP exchange and binding to phospholipase C β (PLCB4), resulting in PIP2 cleavage (PMID: 27089179). Following PIP2 cleavage, the second messenger proteins diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) activate calcium release (PMID: 27089179). CYSLTR2-mediated signaling promotes the activation of a variety of downstream pathways, including PKC, MAPK, and PI3K signaling, which promote several cellular processes such as endothelial permeability (PMID: 15545522, 25839425, 30559191). Overexpression of CYSLTR2 has been reported in several cancer types including colon cancer (PMID: 28402256, 21203429, 23829413). Recurrent somatic mutations in CYSLTR2 are found in patients with uveal melanoma and other related tumor types (PMID: 27089179, 31671564, 29476293, 27934878). These alterations promote ligand-independent activation of CYSLTR2, resulting in pigmentation defects and melanocytic phenotypes (PMID: 27089179).",

    "DAXX (death domain-associated protein) is a protein involved in transcriptional regulation and apoptosis (PMID: 16406523, 9215629). DAXX accumulates in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm; in the nucleus, DAXX associates with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear body and with ATRX-positive heterochromatic regions. In the cytoplasm, DAXX has been reported to interact with various proteins involved in cell death regulation. The proteins encoded by ATRX and DAXX interact with one another and play multiple cellular roles, including chromatin remodeling at telomeres, where they are required for the incorporation of the histone variant H3.3 (PMID: 12953102, 21047901, 20651253, 21029860). DAXX is frequently altered in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) (PMID: 21252315).",
    "DAZAP1 is an RNA binding protein that is a member of the Musashi protein family (PMID: 19285026, 21576381). DAZAP1 is highly expressed in the testes and functions as an important regulator of spermatogenesis and development (PMID: 15700540, 18669443, 16772659, 28575377). Several cellular processes related to mRNA stability and protein translation are regulated by DAZAP1 (PMID: 19285026, 21576381). Localization of DAZAP1 is controlled by active transcription and MAPK-directed phosphorylation, and DAZAP1 has been shown to have nuclear shuttling and mRNA transport activities (PMID: 16772659, 15700540, 16848763). DAZAP1 interacts with the mRNA processing enzymes hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 to control splicing (PMID: 29505834, 18391021, 18391021, 21858080, 24452013). In addition, the association of DAZAP1 with DAZ, a gene on the Y chromosome and expressed in germ cells, has been implicated in the regulation of translation (PMID: 16848763). Recurrent translocations with DAZAP1 and the partner protein MEF2D are found in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (PMID: 28778863, 30630978) and are associated with poor patient outcome (PMID: 27507882, 27824051). MEF2D-DAZAP1 fusion proteins demonstrate oncogenic activity by increasing MEF2D transcriptional activity, HDAC9 expression, and cellular transformation (PMID: 15182431, 27507882, 27824051). HDAC inhibition may be efficacious in patients with MEF2D translocations (PMID: 27507882).",
    "The DCUN1D1 L30A mutation is located in the UBA domain of the protein. In HeLA and U2OS cell lines engineered to express this alteration, DCUN1D1 has a reduced ability to bind polyubiquitin chains of target cullin-RING E3 ligases.

    "DCUN1D1 (also SCCRO and DCN1) is a component of E3 ligase complexes that mediate neddylation (PMID: 18826954, 31898237). Neddylation is a cellular process that places a ubiquitin-like modification (NEDD8) on E3 ligase-associated substrate proteins via cullin protein scaffolding (PMID: 18826954). DCUN1D1 binds to cullin-RING E3 ligase complexes in the cytoplasm and coordinates nuclear translocation, promoting the optimal transfer of NEDD8 from the E2 complex to cullin-associated substrates (PMID: 28581483, 31898237). DCUN1D1 activity is implicated in the regulation of a variety of proteins, including the activation of the VHL E3 ligase and other cullin ubiquitin ligases (PMID: 26743088, 23201271, 23401859). In addition, DCUN1D1 can relieve the negative inhibition of CAND1, a protein that binds unneddylated cullin-RING complexes (PMID: 25349211). Overexpression of DCUN1D1 is found in cancer, including in non-small cell lung cancer, and may be associated with a poorer prognosis (PMID: 22500162, 27285984, 25411243). Amplification of DCUN1D1 is observed in squamous cell carcinomas and is associated with cancer progression (PMID: 17018598, 23908357).

    "DDIT3 (CHOP) is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors and is involved in negative regulation of adipocyte differentiation (PMID: 7805034). In normal cells, DDIT3 expression and activity is induced by cellular ER stress, specifically DNA damage and irradiation exposure. Overexpression of DDIT3 from ER stress can ultimately lead to activation of apoptotic pathways (PMID: 11121490, 1617653, 8754828, 14685163) due to a decrease in Bcl-2 expression and subsequent translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria (PMID: 14685163). Translocations of DDIT3 such as the EWSR1-DDIT3 fusion and the FUS-DDIT3 fusion are found in liposarcomas, which abolish the ability of DDIT3 to arrest cell growth leading to aberrant cellular proliferation (PMID: 24790523, 24320889).",

    "DDR2 (Discoidin Domain Receptor 2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates several downstream signaling pathways. When the extracellular discoidin domain of the receptor is bound by its cognate ligand, collagen, autophosphorylation of the DDR2 intracellular kinase domain is initiated, which results in activation of several downstream signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Activation of these pathways promotes cellular migration, differentiation, proliferation and survival (PMID: 16186108, 17703188, 16626936). DDR2 activation or expression has been implicated in metastasis of various cancer types, such as colorectal cancer, melanoma and breast cancer (PMID: 22071959, 21735168, 21701781, 23644467, 25130389) through mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. Somatic gain-of-function mutations in DDR2 have been identified in squamous cell lung cancers (PMID: 22768234, 22328973) and at lower frequencies in other cancers.

    "DDX3X (also DDX) is an RNA helicase that is a member of the DEAD box protein family. DDX3X is implicated in a variety of cellular functions that regulate RNA structure including RNA transport, translation initiation, splicing, ribosome, and spliceosome assembly (PMID: 17667941, 27180681). In addition, DDX3X mediates cell cycle control by regulating translational initiation of key cell cycle proteins, including Cyclin E1 (PMID: 20837705) and hypoxia-inducible genes, including HIF-1α (PMID: 21448281). Germline mutations in DDX3X are found in patients with intellectual disabilities (PMID: 28135719, 26235985). Somatic loss-of-function mutations in DDX3X are found in patients with medulloblastoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mesothelioma and head and neck cancers (PMID: 22150006, 22722829, 22820256, 21798893, 26928227, 26192917), suggesting that DDX3X predominantly functions as a tumor suppressor. DDX3X is commonly mutated in tumor types with altered WNT signaling and has been implicated as a transcriptional regulator of WNT responsive genes (PMID: 22820256). Expression of DDX3X has been linked to a cancer stem cell population and may mediate resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (PMID: 25343452).

    "DDX4 (also VASA) is an RNA helicase that is a member of the DEAD box protein family (PMID: 28612512). Expression of DDX4 is localized predominantly in migratory primordial germ cells, and DDX4 is important for embryonic patterning and germline specification (PMID: 10920202, 11178242, 11178242). More specifically, DDX4 may be a marker of oocyte precursor cells (PMID: 26444630, 22366948, 29725036); however, this result is controversial (PMID: 32123174). DDX4 interacts with the general translation factor eIF5B and mediates translation of many mRNAs involved in germline specification and maintenance (PMID: 10920202, 16630817, 28612512). The eIF5B-DDX4 interaction facilitates ATP hydrolysis and specific RNA unwinding functions, which may be suitable for RNAs with specific structures (PMID: 16630817). Transient DDX4 expression has also been found in the context of regeneration in somatic cells or during wound healing (PMID: 27179696). The activity of DDX4 is also implicated in the transport of PIWI RNAs to the cytoplasm in germ cells, which is important for the suppression of transposable elements (PMID: 28612512, 23587717). DDX4 expression has been found in ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues (PMID: 27179696, 29963162, 29078734, 28245464). Overexpression of DDX4 in cell lines results in aberrant cell cycle progression, resulting in increased cellular proliferation (PMID: 28612512, 29963162). These abnormal proliferative cellular functions have been associated with dysregulation of PIWI, CCNB1 and E2F1 during cell cycle progression in loss-of-function studies (PMID: 28612512). In addition, DDX4 has been found to bind mitotic spindles in cancer cells and has a role in mediating cellular migration (PMID: 28612512).",
    "Truncating mutations of DDX41 can occur throughout the gene and typically result in the loss of protein function. These mutations have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia and myeloid neoplasm (PMID: 26712909, 36322930)",

    "DDX41 is an RNA helicase that is a member of the DEAD-box protein family (PMID: 27502187). RNA helicases have diverse cellular functions including roles in RNA metabolism, immune response and viral infection (PMID: 27502187). In dendritic cells, DDX41 functions as a DNA sensor that recognizes double-stranded DNA or cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP), which are byproducts released during viral or bacterial infection (PMID: 27502187, 21892174). DDX41 activity regulates the STING pathway, which is important in innate immunity (PMID: 27502187, 28602976, 27721487, 25704810, 23142775). The STING pathway activates type I interferon responses mediated by TBK, IRF1, and NFKB, which are critical for mounting an appropriate response to DNA viruses (PMID: 27502187, 27721487, 25609843). In addition to the role of DDX41 in innate immunity, DDX41 associates with spliceosome proteins and has been implicated in mRNA processing and splicing (PMID: 25920683). Germline, hypomorphic mutations in DDX41 are found in families with a predisposition for hematopoietic malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID: 26712909, 25920683, 31713024, 31484648). DDX41 mutations found in familial carriers predispose individuals to acquire a secondary somatic mutation on the other DDX41 allele, suggesting that DDX41 likely functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 26712909). In addition, individuals with a 5q deletion, a recurrent genetic event in myeloid malignancies, exhibit haploinsufficient expression of DDX41 (PMID: 25920683). DDX41 alterations commonly occur in the ATP binding domain, consistent with the importance of ATP binding in DNA sensing (PMID: 27721487).

    "DEK is a nuclear protein with roles in DNA binding and chromatin regulation (PMID: 25524609). DEK is ubiquitously expressed and modifies chromatin by altering the superhelical density of DNA, introducing positive supercoils to alter DNA structure (PMID: 11997399, 10837023). DEK also interacts with the chromatin-modifying enzyme p300 and PCAF in order to maintain heterochromatin state and influence gene expression (PMID: 16696975, 21460035). In addition to regulating epigenetic state, DEK facilitates cellular proliferation by resolving conditions of DNA replication stress at the replication fork (PMID: 25347734). DEK forms a complex with the DNA repair protein RAD51 and is a critical mediator of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (PMID: 28317934). Loss of DEK expression results in genome instability and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents (PMID: 28317934). DEK is also required for other cellular functions including mRNA splicing, apoptosis, and chemoresistance, among others (PMID: 19679545, 28317934). DEK is overexpressed in several tumor types including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, small cell lung cancer, among others, and increased DEK expression is linked to poor patient prognosis (PMID: 25197373, 23902796, 21663673, 25544761, 24608431).

    "DICER1 is an endoribonuclease that catalyzes the cleavage of large RNA molecules into silencing RNAs or microRNAs. In addition, DICER1 loads siRNA onto the Argonaute protein and mediates the binding of co-factors to initiate RNA-induced silencing (PMID: 25176334). In this way, DICER1 plays a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression (PMID: 25176334). Germline mutations in DICER1 are associated with DICER1-related disorders, a familial tumor susceptibility syndrome that confers increased risk most commonly for pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), cystic nephroma (CN), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), multinodular goiter, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor and other neoplastic conditions (PMID: 19556464, 21266384, 21882293, 24761742). The majority of germline mutations in DICER1 are nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations leading to premature protein truncation and loss of protein function (PMID: 21266384, 19556464, 25176334). Somatic DICER1 mutations have also been identified, predominantly affecting the region of the protein that mediates the interaction of DICER1 with miRNAs (PMID: 25176334). DICER1 has been identified as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 19903759, 20019750), as monoallelic but biallelic loss of DICER1 causes tumor formation. Consistent with the role of DICER1 as a tumor suppressor, reduced expression of DICER1 correlates with a poor outcome in lung, breast, skin, endometrial and ovarian cancer (PMID: 15723655, 19092150, 19782670, 20210522, 20832293).",

The exosome complex prominently participates in RNA processing and quality control pathways (PMID: 21289487). In addition, DIS3 regulates the maturation of many RNA targets, including the tumor suppressor let-7 miRNAs, which control the translation of oncogenes such as MYC and RAS (PMID: 25925570, 26305418). Recurrent familial and somatic mutations of DIS3 have been found in patients with multiple myeloma (PMID: 21430775, 24434212, 22573403, 25521164, 23396385, 22237025, 30967618). These DIS3 loss-of-function mutations have been shown to interfere with the exonucleolytic activity, causing defects in RNA processing, cellular proliferation, and protein translation (PMID: 24150935).

    "DKK1 is an extracellular ligand that is a member of the Dickkopf protein family (PMID: 28979801, 17143291). DKK1 functions as a negative regulator of the WNT signaling pathway by binding to LRP5/6 co-receptors and precluding WNT-mediated activation of downstream signaling (PMID: 28979801, 17143291, 23258168). WNT signaling is a critical developmental pathway with roles in determining cell fate, tissue identity and polarity (PMID: 28218291). DKK1-mediated antagonism of WNT blocks Frizzled receptor binding to LRP5/6 and results in the activation of the β-catenin destruction complex (containing APC, GSK3β and AXIN), which targets β-catenin for degradation (PMID: 23258168). In the absence of WNT signaling, TCF and LEF transcription factors form a repressive complex, leading to inhibition of β-catenin target genes (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). DKK1 also binds to the receptors Kremen1 and Kremen2 to remove the LRP6 co-receptor from the plasma membrane (PMID: 12050670). In addition, DKK1 is involved in the regulation of many cellular functions including developmental patterning, apoptosis, angiogenesis and invasion (PMID: 22807036, 27608843, 28979801, 11702953, 31568519).

    "DKK3 is an extracellular ligand that is a member of the Dickkopf protein family (PMID: 28979801, 17143291). Dickkopf proteins predominantly function as negative regulators of the WNT signaling pathway by binding to WNT pathway signaling receptors, such as LRP5/6 (PMID: 24316024, 23258168, 12527209). WNT signaling is a critical developmental pathway with roles in determining cell fate, tissue identity, and polarity (PMID: 28218291).

    "DNAJB1 (DNAJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 1) is a member of the HSP40 protein family and has been linked to several cellular processes, such as the proteasome pathway, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and virus infection (PMID: 19340594, 22075554, 23400395, 21698289). DNAJB1 interacts with HSP70 and induces its ATPase activity, which stimulates the association between HSP70 and Hsc70-interacting protein (HIP) (PMID: 24309468). A seminal feature of DNAJB1 is the presence of the DNAJB1-PRKACA chimeric transcript in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) tumors. Numerous independent studies have confirmed the presence of the fusion gene in 80-100% of FLCs tumor samples (PMID: 25557953, 25698061, 25605237, 25122662, 24578576, 26489647). The fusion encodes a chimeric protein that couples a segment of DNAJB1, with the catalytic domain of protein kinase A (PKA) that confers constitutive kinase activity. Although analyses of a wider array of cancer types are required to more definitively establish the specificity of DNAJB1-PRKACA to FLCs, the current evidence suggests that DNAJB1-PRKACA may be a tissue biomarker for FLCs and if the chimeric protein is secreted into circulation, it may also serve as a plasma biomarker.",

DNMT1 preferentially methylates hemimethylated DNA, namely daughter strands that are newly generated during the cell cycle (PMID: 21163962). DNMT1 plays an important role in a number of physiologic processes such as X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, chromosomal stability, and repression of retrotransposon expression. DNMT1 mutations are rarely found in human cancers; however, DNMT1 overexpression has been observed in colon cancer (PMID: 2014266), gastric cancer (PMID: 14742272), breast cancer (PMID: 14555514), bladder cancer (PMID: 14634451), and acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia (PMID: 11222358).

DTX1 ubiquitinates substrates, including MEKK1 and C-FLIP, and targets them to the proteasome for degradation (PMID: 15684388, 29374180). High expression of DTX1 is found in germinal center B cells, marginal zone B cells, lymphoid cells and the nervous system (PMID: 22891273, 15684394, 26714454). The activity of DTX1 is important for regulation of T cell anergy and FOXP3 activity in regulatory T cells (PMID: 25695215, 19592273). In addition, DTX1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of Notch in association with the coactivator p300 to inhibit neural progenitor (PMID: 11564735, 14567914), B, NK, and T cell differentiation (PMID: 15187027, 27048872).

    "DUSP22 (also JKAP, JSP-1) is a dual-specificity phosphatase with several roles in the regulation of downstream signaling pathways. Dual-specificity phosphatases can dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues within the same substrate (PMID: 19228121). DUSP22 inhibits T-cell receptor signaling by dephosphorylating and inactivating MAPK and ERK2 (PMID: 11733513) In addition, DUSP22 is a negative regulator of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and is an inhibitor of cell migration via reduced FAK activity (PMID: 20018849). DUSP22 can also positively regulate downstream signaling pathways; for example, DUSP22 binds JNK and activates the JNK pathway (PMID: 11717427, 27711255). Because DUSP22 has been implicated in the regulation of several signaling pathways, DUSP22 is thought to be involved in mediating various cellular functions including cell proliferation, cell death, chemotaxis and T-cell receptor signaling (PMID: 24714587, 28725226, 27711255, 28017968).

    "DUSP4 is a protein tyrosine/threonine phosphatase that regulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK pathway. DUSP4 negatively regulates the MAPK/ERK pathway by dephosphorylating ERK1/2 (PMID: 7535768). In addition, DUSP4 dephosphorylates substrates in the JNK pathway and mediates crosstalk between the JNK/JUN and MAPK/ERK pathways (PMID: 29795445). DUSP4 itself is a transcriptional target of MAPK-activated ERK1/2, and in turn inhibits ERK1/2 through a negative feedback mechanism, thus tempering MAPK-induced cell growth and proliferation (PMID: 22430215). DUSP4 expression has been found to be up- or downregulated in several cancer types; however, somatic mutations in DUSP4 are rare and have not yet been functionally characterized (PMID: 22965873, 22430215).

E2F proteins play overlapping roles in various processes, including DNA replication, progression through from G1 to S stages of the cell cycle, and cell-fate determination but they also appear to have certain distinct functions (PMID: 12748276, 9679057). The RB/E2F axis is considered a pivotal in activating DNA replication and G1/S transition in a manner dependent on RB's inhibitory effect on E2F proteins (PMID: 8246996, 11257102, 9365528). E2F3-specific activity includes TFE3 binding and DDX5 induction, mediation of MYC-induced transition to S phase (together with E2F2), and induction of specific target genes (PMID: 12748276, 10733529, 11511364) E2F3-deficient mice exhibit impaired growth and cell proliferation (PMID: 10733529). Amplification and subsequent overexpression of E2F3 has been observed in prostate and bladder cancer as well as lung cancer and metastatic urothelial carcinoma (PMID: 14716298, 15122326, 18037967, 16953223, 16938365, 15184867, 16909110, 24476821, 25886454). Also, E2F3 appears to be a target for the ETS fusions in certain cancers (PMID: 23940108).",
    "Truncating mutations of EBF1 typically result in the loss of protein expression. In vitro studies with lentiviral vectors expressing truncated transcripts of EBF1 demonstrate that truncating mutations are inactivating as measured by nonsense-mediated decay and loss of EBF1 expression compared to wildtype (PMID: 22472950)",
    "EBF1 encodes for a transcription factor that regulates various processes associated with B-cell lymphopoiesis, transcription and activation (PMID: 20451411). EBF1 and PAX5 work synergistically to regulate B-cell expansion and lineage commitment via a MYC-dependent regulatory loop and other feedback loops (PMID: 33619557, 17101802). The oncogenic function of EBF1 may be tissue-specific. Knockdown of EBF1 in various cancer cell lines induces increased TERT promoter activity, cellular viability and cellular proliferation, suggesting that EBF1 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene in these tissue-specific contexts (PMID: 32364535, 28555080). Downregulation of EBF1 has been identified in various cancer types, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma (PMID: 17344859, 32676457, 29169115, 32364535). Conversely, overexpression of EBF1 in acute myeloid leukemia and breast cancer cell lines induces cellular proliferation, cellular migration, the inhibition of apoptosis and cell cycle progression, suggesting that EBF1 functions predominantly as an oncogene in these tissue-specific contexts (PMID: 35867755)(Abstract: Zhou et al.

    "ECSIT is an adaptor protein that functions in the assembly of the mitochondrial complex I (PMID: 17344420). Mitochondrial complex I is the largest subunit of the respiratory chain, functioning in the electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone as a proton pump for ATP synthesis (PMID: 13771349). ECSIT is directed by an N-terminal targeting sequence to localize to the mitochondria, allowing for interaction with chaperone protein NDUFAF1 and subsequent assembly and stabilization of mitochondrial complex I (PMID: 17344420). Other functions for ECSIT include activation of the inflammatory response through the Toll signaling pathway and embryonic development through the BMP signaling pathway (PMID: 10465784, 14633973). Overexpression of ECSIT in breast cancer cell lines and xenograft mouse models increases cell proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that ECSIT functions primarily as an oncogene (PMID: 35571656). Amplification of ECSIT has been identified in breast cancer and ovarian cancer (PMID: 35571656, 35131872).",

GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) activate GTPases, which are enzymes that cycle between a GTP-bound active conformation and a GDP-bound inactive conformation. GTPases regulate downstream signaling pathways and are involved in a variety of cellular functions including proliferation, cell adhesion, and cell cycle progression, among others (PMID: 27301673). Additional functional work is required to determine the exact cellular function of ECT2L. Somatic mutations in ECT2L are found in patients with T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 22237106). ECT2L alterations predominantly occur as missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations (PMID: 22237106), suggesting that ECT2L acts as a tumor suppressor.",

    "EED (Embryonic Ectoderm Development) is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) which is responsible for transcriptional repression by catalyzing di- and tri-methylation of Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) (PMID: 16630818). The EED-EZH2 interaction is necessary for the histone methyltransferase activity of PRC2 (PMID: 23974116), which is important in regulating development and expression of cell identity genes, including the HOX cluster of genes (PMID: 16625203). EED interacts with the PRC1 complex to mediate histone H2A ubiquitination (PMID: 24457600), and germline mutations have been identified with an over-growth syndrome (PMID: 25787343). EED is mutated in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and myeloid neoplasms (PMID: 25240281, 22237106, 23486531).

    "EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) is a transmembrane receptor that is activated by EGF family extracellular ligands (PMID: 24691965). EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptors, including the receptors ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4. Binding of EGFR by its ligands, including EGF ligands and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), activates downstream signaling pathways including the canonical MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascades (PMID: 22239438). EGFR can homodimerize or heterodimerize with other ErbB family members to initiate signaling (PMID: 25621509). Activation of EGFR-mediated signaling ultimately results in cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation (PMID: 18045542). While EGFR usually is expressed at low levels in normal adult tissues, hyperactivation of this receptor by somatic mutations and/or amplification of the EGFR gene is found in many cancer types such as lung, brain, colorectal and head and neck cancer (PMID: 10880430, 17318210). In lung cancer, activating mutations in EGFR result in a constitutively activated form of the receptor that is sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition (PMID: 15329413). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR, including afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib, have been approved for first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer patients (PMID: 14977817, 24868098, 26039556, 25963089). Second site resistance mutations in EGFR can occur in cancers previously treated with these inhibitors (PMID: 29068003). Osimertinib is a second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been FDA approved for relapsed patients with non-small cell lung cancer with the EGFR resistance mutations T790M, L858R, and exon 19 deletions (PMID: 27923840). Additionally, copy number amplification of the EGFR gene result in receptor overexpression in several cancer types, including brain and colorectal cancers, and these cancers may also be sensitive to EGFR inhibition (PMID: 11426640).",

    "EGR1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the EGR family of zinc finger proteins (PMID: 16138117). EGR1 stimulates the transcriptional activity of several key tumor suppressor genes including TGFβ1, PTEN, TP53, and fibronectin (PMID: 16138117). The activity of EGR1 is required to mediate several cellular functions induced by these tumor suppressors including growth control, differentiation, cell attachment and apoptosis (PMID: 16138117). EGR1 is also implicated in immune regulation; EGR1 expression is upregulated after T cell stimulation and mediates B cell development (PMID: 19915002, 18802061). In addition, EGR1 regulates the activity of CBP/p300 transcription coactivators in prostate cells (PMID: 15225550). Loss of EGR1 in preclinical models results in transformation, hematopoietic defects and increased tumor formation in murine models (PMID: 17420284). EGR1 expression has been found to be reduced in a variety of tumor types, suggesting that EGR1 functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 9212230). Somatic mutations in EGR1 are found in follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphomas (PMID: 24362818, 22158541, 22891273, 24145436). EGR1 alterations typically occur in the N-terminus and are predicted to be loss-of-function (PMID: 24362818). Conversely, EGR1 expression is overexpressed in prostate cancer and may function as an oncogene in that context (PMID: 12833142, 16138117)",

    "EIF2B1 is a subunit of EIF2B, a five-subunit guanine nucleotide exchange factor that plays a key role in mRNA translation regulation (PMID: 29425030, 18974117). The EIF2B five subunit complex is composed of EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4 and EIF2B5, which encode for the α, β, γ, δ and ε subunits, respectively (PMID: 29425030). EIF2B functions as the nucleotide exchange factor for the GTPase EIF2, which initiates translation by bringing methionyl-tRNA to the ribosome (PMID: 29425030). EIF2B complex activity is inhibited when EIF2 is phosphorylated by stress-induced kinases (PMID: 29425030). EIF2B1, along with subunits EIF2B2 and EIF2B4, forms the regulatory subcomplex of EIF2B (PMID: 24811713). EIF2B2 and EIF2B4 have been identified as essential to the translation initiation and nucleotide exchange activity with EIF2, whereas EIF2B1 is required for inhibiting translation (PMID: 29036434). EIF2B1 mutations disrupt the ability of EIF2B to sense phosphorylated EIF2, resulting in increased endoplasmic reticulum stress (PMID: 31882561). The stress conditions have been identified as a cause for patient liver dysfunction and leukoencephalopathy due to unregulated unfolded protein response and cell death (PMID: 31882561, 25761052).",
    "EIF3E encodes for a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (EIF3) complex, which functions in the initiation of protein synthesis (PMID: 17581632). EIF3E regulates various cellular processes including cellular proliferation, DNA damage response repair and protein degradation through the regulation of translation and binding to other multiprotein complexes (PMID: 25849773, 22508697, 17324924). The oncogenic function of EIF3E may be tissue-specific. Overexpression of EIF3E in various cancer cell lines induces cellular proliferation, cellular invasion and tumor growth, suggesting that EIF3E functions predominantly as an oncogene in these tissue-specific contexts (PMID: 20453879, 25400724). EIF3E amplification has been identified in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, glioblastoma, colon cancer and oral cancer (PMID: 20453879, 24481065, 25400724, 25123227). Conversely, loss of EIF3E in other cancer cell line studies has shown induction of cellular senescence, increased mTORC1 signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, suggesting that EIF3E also has tumor suppressive functions in these tissue-specific contexts (PMID: 33868586, 22907435). EIF3E downregulation has been identified in breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 22907435, 15867213). Preclinical studies of breast cancer cells suggest that loss of EIF3E confers resistance to PARP inhibition (PMID: 33868586).",
    "EIF4A2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A2) is a translation initiation factor required for binding of mRNA ribosomal subunits. EIF4A2 is one of three mammalian isoforms of EIF4A (EIF4A1-3) which are mRNA-dependent ATPases and RNA helicases and members of the DEAD-box family of proteins, a group of proteins named after their shared motifs with roles in various cellular processes (PMID: 10872469, 2563148). More specifically, EIF4A2 is an essential factor in the binding of mRNA to the 43S pre-initiation complex, a rate-limiting step and main target of translational control, in which EIF4A2 unwinds mRNA secondary structure to enable the ribosome to bind to a single-stranded molecule (PMID: 10872469). EIF4A2 and EIF4A1 are highly similar in sequence and function but appear to be expressed in spatiotemporally distinct patterns (PMID: 3046931, 8521730). EIF4A2 has also been implicated in micro-RNA-mediated gene regulation (PMID: 23559250). Downregulation of EIF4A2 expression has been observed in non-small cell lung cancer and correlates with poor prognosis, but mutations in EIF4A2 are rare in human tumors (PMID: 23867391).",
    "EIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ) is a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex. The eIF4F complex additionally consists of an EIF4A isoform and EIF4G and directs the ribosome to the 5' 7-methylguanosine cap of mRNAs in what is considered a rate-limiting step of translation (PMID: 291969, 3469651). As a vital part of translation initiation, EIF4E controls cellular size and is thought to be a direct target of mTOR, which can phosphorylate the translational repressor 4EBP1, allowing for EIF4E to enter the eIF4F complex (PMID: 12080086). Overexpression of EIF4E has been detected in tumors of the breast, bladder, colon, lung, and cervix and can cause malignant transformation in in vitro studies (PMID: 9330633, 9285563, 8244582, 7829225, 25986608, 10638984, 11401917, 12374671, 16260273, 16280668, 20049173). Furthermore, EIF4E exhibits oncogenic traits in a mouse model of lymphoma and is implicated in drug resistance both in contexts of mTOR, BRAF, and MEK targeting (PMID: 15029198, 16103051, 25079330, 25422161, 25615552). Thus, EIF4E is considered a therapeutic target in certain tumor types on the principles that translational control often is deregulated in cancer cells and that PI3K and mTOR signaling and MAPK-interacting kinases (MNKs) are involved in this process (PMID: 22474009, 25743081, 25425688). A variant in the promoter region of EIF4E has been identified in two families with autistic children (PMID: 19556253).",
    "Truncating ELF3 mutations can disrupt the protein's normal function by removing essential regions. The ETS domain (residues 272-357) is responsible for ELF3's DNA-binding ability, and it has been shown that truncating the protein at residue 354 results in loss of transcriptional activity from a reporter construct, likely due to decreased affinity for DNA (PMID: 17148437)",

    "EP300 (p300; E1A-binding protein) is a transcriptional co-activator with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity that is homologous to the co-activator CREBBP. EP300 activates transcription by opening chromatin at gene promoters, recruiting transcriptional machinery and acting as a co-factor to recruit transcription factors (PMID: 15186775, 24480624, 11050151, 23474763, 15691758). The HAT activity of EP300 can also regulate the expression of other proteins, including the tumor suppressor p53 and tissue-specific transcription factors like GATA1 (PMID: 9830059, 9859997). Fusion proteins that include the EP300 HAT domain have been identified in rare cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (PMID: 25943178). Somatic mutations in EP300 are found in leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors including small-cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and bladder cancer (PMID: 21390126, 22941188, 24390348, 21822268). EP300 mutations are commonly truncating and often co-occur with loss of the wildtype allele, suggesting that EP300 functions as a tumor suppressor. Small molecule inhibitors targeting EP300 have been found to be efficacious in preclinical and mouse studies (PMID: 26731516).",

    "EP400 is a chromatin remodeling ATPase that functions as a subunit in the TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex (PMID: 18614019). The TIP60-EP400 chromatin remodeling complex binds at gene promoters and facilitates histone acetylation in order to regulate gene expression and epigenetic state (PMID: 18614019). EP400 is bound at promoters and enhancers enriched with H2AZ and H3.3 histone variants (PMID: 26669263). Loss of EP400 expression results in depletion of H2AZ and H3.3 transcription and deposition on chromatin (PMID: 26669263). EP400 also preferentially binds to H4Kme3-modified histones and regulates the transcription of those genes (PMID: 26814966). Due to the global regulation of gene expression and chromatin state, EP400 activity is required for embryonic stem cell maintenance, regulation of cell cycle, and the DNA damage/repair pathways (PMID: 18614019, 15655109, 27814680).

HIF2α binds the hypoxia response element (HRE) present in the promoter of genes that are regulated in the context of reduced oxygen (hypoxia), such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene (PMID: 11301389). Under normal oxygen conditions, HIF2α is hydroxylated and recognized by the tumor suppressor VHL, leading to ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome (PMID: 18498744). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF2α escapes degradation and activates genes involved in the hypoxia response, including genes involved in angiogenesis, glycolysis, apoptosis, proliferation and growth (PMID: 22089927, 14645546). HIF2α activity has been implicated in angiogenesis and oncogenesis in neuroendocrine tumor models (PMID: 23533246, 26432405).

    "ERBB2 (also HER2) is a transmembrane receptor that is a member of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, ERBB3, and ERBB4. ERBB2 does not directly bind its own ligand; instead, it potentiates the activity of other ligand-bound ERBB receptors by binding to them (PMID: 12620236). ERBB2 can heterodimerize with any of the other EGFR family receptors (PMID: 10220407, 9130710) initiating downstream signaling activation of several pathways including the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascades (PMID: 22239438, 12853564). ERBB2 can also homodimerize and initiate MAPK, SRC, PI3K and STAT signaling (PMID: 22785351). Activation of ERBB2-mediated signaling ultimately results in cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation (PMID: 18045542). ERBB2 is activated by gene amplification and overexpression in a range of human cancers including breast, gastric, and endometrial tumors, among others (PMID: 19536107, 24656976). ERBB2 gene amplification in human breast cancers is associated with poor overall survival and time to tumor recurrence (PMID: 3798106, 23000897, 9552035, 9469329). Amplified ERBB2 heterodimerizes with ERBB3 to activate oncogenic signaling and drives tumorigenesis in breast cancer (PMID: 12853564, 23204226, 12124352, 18632642). Somatic mutations in ERBB2 have been identified in a series of tumors including lobular breast, lung adenocarcinoma, and gastric cancers, among others, with recurrent hotspot alterations in both the extracellular and kinase domains (PMID: 23000897, 23220880, 22908275). Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that many of these mutations are transforming and sensitive to FDA-approved ERBB targeted therapies, including trastuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, lapatinib, and pertuzumab (PMID: 24799465).",
    "ERBB3 amplification results in overexpression of the protein. This mutation has been found in breast, gastric and ovarian cancer and frequently co-occurs with amplification of other members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, including EGFR or ERBB2 (PMID: 24886126)",
    ". Expression of ERBB3 is associated with worse survival across multiple cancer types including breast, colorectal, gastric, melanoma, ovarian, head and neck, pancreatic, and cervical cancer (PMID: 23221996)",
    "ERBB3 (also HER3) is a transmembrane receptor that is a member of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB4 (PMID: 19536107, 11252954, 19208461). ERBB3 is unique in that it has limited kinase activity, approximately 1000 fold less than its family member, EGFR (PMID: 8389462, 8058764, 20351256). Thereby, ERBB3 cannot form homodimers (PMID: 15225657) and must heterodimerize with other ERBB family members to initiate downstream signaling (PMID: 8632008). Heterodimerization of ERBB3 with its preferred heterodimer partner, ERBB2, results in activation of several signaling pathways, including the MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, SRC, and STAT pathways (PMID: 7515147, 8026468, 8264617). Preclinical models of ERBB2-amplified cancers demonstrate that ERBB2-amplified cells exquisitely rely on ERBB3 to drive proliferation and survival (PMID: 12853564, 24651011, 19536107). Moreover, ERBB3 feedback upregulation, localization changes, and ligand overexpression contribute to resistance to ERBB or PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors (PMID: 24520092, 24651011, 19536107). Overexpression of ERBB3 has been correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in some human cancers (PMID: 20179223, 20816829). Somatic activating mutations in ERBB3 are found in gastric, bladder, uterine and colorectal cancers, among others (PMID: 23680147). While that are no FDA-approved inhibitors for ERBB3-mutated cancers, preclinical and clinical trials are underway to determine if ERBB targeting compounds alone or in combination with other inhibitors targeting the MAPK pathway are efficacious.",
    "The EZR-ERBB4 fusion involves the N-terminus of EZR, containing the EZR coiled-coil dimerization domain, fused to the C-terminus of ERBB4, containing the ERBB4 kinase and C-terminal domains. This mutation has been found in lung cancer. Expression of this mutation in a murine fibroblast cell line demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased pathway activation, colony formation and tumor growth in xenograft models compared to empty vector. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that this mutation is sensitive to the ERBB kinase inhibitors, lapatinib and afatinib when expressed in a murine fibroblast cell line as measured by decreased cell viability and tumor growth upon drug treatment (PMID: 24727320)",
    "ERBB4 (also HER4) is a transmembrane receptor that is a member of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB3 (PMID: 14504474, 9208852, 22427524, 25492965). Binding of ERBB4 by its ligands, including neuregulins (NRG1-4), betacellulin (BTC), HB-EGF or epiregulin (EPR), activates the receptor and initiates downstream signaling pathways including the canonical MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascades. ERBB4 forms active kinase dimers with other ERBB isoforms, including the preferential binding partner ERRB2 (PMID: 9130710, 10220407, 19208461, 11252954). Somatic activating mutations in ERBB4 have been identified in melanoma (PMID: 22817889, 22842228, 24755198), lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 18948947), gastric (PMID: 25079317, 25583476), and colorectal cancers (PMID: 22895193); however, the role of ERBB4 in cancer is not well established. Evidence in breast cancer cell lines suggests that ERBB4 is not required for mediating tumorigenesis in ERBB2-positive breast cancer but rather for mediating resistance to ERBB2 inhibitors (PMID: 25590338). Conversely, a subset of literature points to a growth-suppressive role for ERBB4 in breast cancer (PMID: 17120616, 24791013, 16832345, 20603612). The prognostic value of ERBB4 expression in cancer is still debatable, as reports have documented both better and worse outcomes in these tumors; however, this may be due to the lack of discrimination between ERBB4 variants (PMID: 25492965, 18454307).",

    "ERCC2 is a DNA helicase that is a member of the RAD3/XPD family of protein helicases. ERCC2 is a regulator of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway; NER is used by cells to repair bulky DNA lesions that are caused by environmental mutagens, UV irradiation and certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin (reviewed in PMID: 24086042). ERCC2 functions as an ATP-dependent 5' to 3' helicase that unwinds damaged DNA, enabling other NER factors to access the DNA for subsequent repair (PMID: 9351836). Germline mutations of ERCC2 lead to trichothiodystrophy, xeroderma pigmentosum and combined xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome (reviewed in PMID: 19809470). Genetic polymorphisms of ERCC2 are associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, including lung (PMID: 20651612), colorectal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 16707649) and urothelial cell carcinoma (PMID: 24347488). Somatic ERCC2 mutations occur in approximately 12% of muscle-invasive bladder cancer and have been associated with response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibition (PMID: 24476821, 25096233, 29489427).",

    "ESR1 is a nuclear receptor that encodes the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) protein. ERα plays a major role in sexual reproductive development and maintenance, specifically in the female reproductive organs (PMID: 10368776). Binding of the hormone estrogen, the ERα ligand, induces conformational changes to ERα, which allows the receptor to dissociate from HSP90 and dimerize with itself or ERβ. The dimer then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to promoters and enhancers of target genes either directly, via Estrogen Responsive Elements (ERE) in the DNA, or via other transcription factor complexes such as FOS/JUN/SP-1 (PMID: 11162939, 10681512). Once bound, the estrogen receptor recruits co-regulators that modulate the transcription of ESR1 target genes, resulting in changes in proliferation, migration and differentiation (PMID: 21779010). Lack of ERα delays the development of WNT1- and ERBB2 mutant-induced mouse mammary tumors (PMID: 10213494, 12019156) and reduces the occurrence of estrogen and carcinogen-induced mouse mammary tumors (PMID: 20181624, 11156389), indicating the involvement of ERα in tumorigenesis. While mutations in ESR1 are generally very rare in primary cancers (<5%), a number of mutations occurring in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the receptor were identified in ~12-25% of hormone-resistant metastatic breast cancer patients (PMID: 24398047, 24185512, 24185510, 24217577).

    "ETAA1 (also ETAA16) is a replication stress protein that promotes fork progression (PMID: 27601467, 27723717, 27723720).

The activity of ETAA1 stimulates ATR, a protein kinase involved in DNA sensing (PMID: 27601467), via a distinct arm independent from TOPBP1-mediated repair (PMID: 27723717, 30139873). Specifically, ETAA1 associates with two distinct replication complexes including ATR/ATRIP and BLM/TOP3α/RMI1/RMI2 (PMID: 27723720). Loss of ETAA1 results in genome instability, altered DNA replication and sensitivity to replication stress (PMID: 27723717, 27723720). In addition, reduced ETAA1 expression in murine models results in a diminished T-cell response, suggesting that ETAA1 may have a role in immune cell regulation (PMID: 28607084).

ETV1 is a downstream transcriptional mediator of the MAP kinase pathway and it is tightly regulated by the MAP kinase through transcription, protein stability, and phosphorylation (PMID: 12213813, 19251651, 20927104). The endogenous expression of ETV1 is restricted to several tissues, including specific neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems (PMID: 16289830, 21746923, 10850491) and the interstitial cells of Cajal (“pacemaker” cells of the gastrointestinal tract) (PMID: 20927104). ETV1 is aberrantly activated in several cancers through distinct mechanisms: In Ewing sarcoma, ETV1 is fused with the EWS protein to generate the chimeric EWS-ETV1 protein. In prostate cancer, ETV1 is aberrantly over-expressed through translocation resulting in either fusion transcript or full-length transcript. In melanoma, ETV1 is aberrantly over-expressed through genetic amplification of its chromosomal locus. In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), ETV1 is endogenously highly expressed and required to maintain lineage specification and survival (PMID: 7700648, 17671502, 20160028, 20927104).",
    "The EWSR1-ETV4 fusion (t(17;22)(q12;q12)) is also known as EWSR1-E1AF. Wildtype ETV4 serves as a transcription factor and activates matrix metalloproteinase genes among many others. The fusion with EWSR1 has been hypothesized to lead to tumor progression (PMID: 8605035)",
    " although further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of oncogenicity. While this fusion has not been functionally validated, small case studies have confirmed the presence of EWSR1-ETV4 fusions in Ewing's Sarcoma patients by Southern blot, RT-PCR, and FISH (PMID: 8834175, 8605035, 22429598)",

    "ETV4 (also PEA3 and E1AF) is a transcription factor that belongs to the ETS family of transcription factors. The family consists of a highly conserved group of genes that play important roles in cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis (PMID: 21548782). ETV4 in particular plays an important role in development, such as in organogenesis of the kidney, mammary gland, and limb buds (PMID: 9285689, 12871699, 19386269). ETV4 is overexpressed in various types of solid cancers, including the esophagus (PMID: 21143918), colon (PMID: 15695237), breast (PMID: 21404275, 15387369), ovarian (PMID: 12684413), non-small lung (PMID: 11519038) and gastric (PMID: 14604892), where it promotes metastatic progression and correlates with reduced survival. In prostate cancers (~1% of the cases) ETV4 overexpression is associated with translocation of ETV4 to the promoter of a gene highly expressed in prostate (TMPRSS2, KLK2, DDX5, and CANT1) (PMID: 18794152, 16585160, 18451133). Finally, fusions of ETV4 with Ewing's sarcoma (EWSR1) gene have been reported in three cases of Ewing sarcoma (ES) (PMID: 8834175, 8605035, 22429598). The defining feature of this tumor type is chromosomal translocation involving the EWSR1 gene and one of five ETS genes.",
    "The TMPRSS2-ETV5 fusion replaces the 5' end of ETV5 with the 5' UTR of TMPRSS2. ETV5 is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors and the fusion causes overexpression of ETV5 due to the androgen-responsive TMPRSS2 promoter region.

PEA3 family members are activated by pathways such as the MAPK and PKA pathway to induce the transcription of gene programs through phosphorylation (PMID: 8895521, 8808707). ETV4 and ETV5 are involved in the proliferation of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and subsequent induction of differentiation cascades, potentially through changes in Oct3/4 expression (PMID: 26224636). Additionally, ETV5 has been shown to be expressed during embryonic development, especially at sites undergoing branching morphogenesis (PMID: 12871699, 19898483, 19386268). In the testis, ETV5 is exclusively expressed in the Sertoli cells and is required for spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal (PMID: 16107850).",

ETS domains typically bind to a GGAA/T DNA sequence, but can also be involved in protein-protein interactions (PMID: 11175367). ETV6 is essential for hematopoietic stem cells (PMID: 17980166) and may initiate the regulatory cascade leading to their production (PMID: 20412772). Translocations involving band 12p13 around ETV6 are one of the most commonly observed alterations in hematological malignancies (PMID: 22578774). ETV6 has a large number of fusion partners and typically contributes to tumorigenesis by modifying the activity or function of the partner gene or a proto-oncogene close to a translocation site (PMID: 22578774). Somatic mutations occur at a relatively low frequency in solid tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2016). Germline ETV6 mutations contribute to hematologic malignancies including ALL (PMID: 25581430, 26573422). ETV6-NTRK3 fusion has been shown to be sensitive to crizotinib (PMID: 25207766)",
    "EWSR1 fusions generally arise from chromosomal translocations of the N-terminus of EWSR1 (usually involving exons 7-10) to the C terminus of another protein.

The N-terminal domain of EWSR1 can fuse to the C-terminal domain of a number of transcription factors and give rise to several fusion proteins that have been implicated in Ewing Sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, myxoid liposarcoma, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and clear cell sarcoma (PMID: 16784984, 25364450, 17691072, 17525681, 17227118, 24320889).",
    "EXT1 (Exostoses-1) is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase which is required for the polymerization of heparan sulfate (HS)(PMID: 9756849). HS polymerization is necessary for the formation of fibronectin fibrils and the subsequent formation of the insoluble cell-matrix (PMID: 34890641). The reduction of EXT1, therefore, leads to reduced fibril assembly and global changes in cellular homeostasis, including increased cell size, ER structure and changes to membrane glycome and lipid compositions, which impact the metabolism of the cell (PMID: 33962942). Mutations in EXT1 are associated with hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), an autosomal dominant bone disorder characterized by the formation of osteochondromas and an increased risk for chondro- and osteosarcoma (PMID: 7550340). While somatic mutations of EXT1 are rare in sporadic neoplasms, EXT1 expression can be reduced by the hypermethylation of the CpG island promoter, which has been found as a method of EXT1 loss in cell lines from patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and non-melanoma skin cancer (PMID: 15385438).",

The FA core complex, which includes FANCC and 7 other FA proteins, assemble at sites of damaged chromatin and coordinate the DNA repair response (PMID: 27145721). By scaffolding with BRCA1/2 proteins, the FA core complex facilitates homologous combination via repair of interstrand DNA crosslinks (PMID: 21605559, 16687415). The FA pathway is activated in response to cellular stress, which interrupts replication and transcription (PMID: 23114602). Monoubiquitination of FANCD2 by the core FA complex is required to mediate DNA repair (PMID: 17352736). FANCC directly interacts with transcriptional regulators, such as the co-repressor C-terminal binding protein 1 (Ctbp1) and β-catenin, to modulate gene expression and signaling (PMID: 23303816, 24469828).

    "FANCG, a member of the Fanconi anemia complementation group, encodes for a DNA repair protein that functions in the Fanconi anemia pathway (PMID: 12861027, 11050007). The Fanconi anemia pathway is a network of proteins and subcomplexes that collectively function in DNA repair and safeguard genomic stability through the activation of the Fanconi anemia core complex (PMID: 12515506). The Fanconi anemia core complex initiates DNA repair through monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI proteins, which results in DNA interstrand crosslink repair (PMID: 31666700, 32167469). The Fanconi anemia proteins assemble at sites of damaged chromatin to form the Fanconi anemia core complex (PMID: 27145721, 31666700, 24910428). FANCG functions as a scaffold to facilitate the formation of the Fanconi anemia core complex and the D1-D2-G-X3 with BRCA2, FANCD2 and XRCC3 (PMID: 18212739). Knockout of FANCG in human adenocarcinoma cell lines impairs DNA repair pathways and results in chromosome breakage, suggesting that FANCG functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 16762635). Germline FANCG mutations are found in individuals with Fanconi anemia, a condition associated with congenital defects, bone marrow failure, and increased risk of cancer (PMID: 23653579).",

    "FANCL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase belonging to the Fanconi Anemia (FA) group of proteins. These proteins coordinate homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA damage, specifically interstrand DNA crosslinks, by localizing to the site of damage using the BRCA1/2 proteins as a scaffold (PMID: 21605559). Essential for this DNA repair is monoubiquitinated, activated FANCD2 (PMID: 17352736). Monoubiquitination of FANCD2 relies on a nuclear complex of several FA proteins, including FANCL, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG and FANCM; FANCL is the ubiquitin ligase required for FANCD2 monoubiquitination and its resulting HRR activity (PMID: 26149689, 31666700, 27986371, 20154706). Loss of FANCL in the germline can result in Fanconi Anemia, a cancer-predisposing syndrome characterized by hematological abnormalities, bone marrow failure, limb deformities, skin hyperpigmentation and susceptibility to hematologic and solid malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 24773018, 25754594). Hematological abnormalities in FA patients may be due in part to the role of FANCL in regulating β-catenin (PMID: 22653977). FANCL is mutated somatically in various cancers including head and neck carcinoma, among others (PMID: 28678401). FANCL loss and the resulting deficiency in HRR may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, which is FDA-approved for patients with HRR-deficient prostate cancer (PMID: 32343890).",
    "FANCM (FA complementation group M) encodes for a DNA translocase with DNA-dependent ATPase activity (PMID: 30714416, 20117061, 31663812). FANCM is involved in homologous recombination and repair of interstrand DNA cross-links (ICLs) (PMID: 30714416, 20117061). FANCM participates in the proper functioning of the Fanconi anemia pathway, which helps to suppress the formation of tumors (PMID: 31663812). FANCM also regulates the Bloom’s complex, a complex of proteins in which germline mutations can lead to the cancer predisposition disorder Bloom’s Syndrome (PMID: 31663812). Loss of function of the FANCM gene has not been associated with Fanconi anemia, but rather with infertility and cancer predisposition (PMID: 30714416). The gene is also essential for the viability of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) cancers (PMID: 31663812). FANCM mutations have been identified in patients with breast and ovarian cancers (PMID: 30714416, 36707629).",

    "FAS (also FAS1, CD95, APO-1) is a death receptor that mediates apoptosis (PMID: 20505730). FAS binds the cognate ligand CD95L, a protein predominantly expressed on T and NK cells, resulting in the death of the associated cell expressing the FAS receptor (PMID: 22042271). The FAS-CD95L interaction results in the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex that includes FADD, caspase 8, and caspase 10 (PMID: 12393594). Proteolytic processing of caspases then triggers a cascade that initiates apoptosis (PMID: 28445729, 28445729). FAS can also activate other downstream signaling cascades, including activation of the NF-KB and JNK pathways (PMID: 8647190). Loss of FAS expression in several murine models of cancer, including ovarian and liver, results in reduced apoptosis and enhanced tumor growth (PMID: 20505730). Germline mutations in FAS are associated with an autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, a disorder associated with chronic lymphadenopathy and an increased risk of lymphoma development (PMID: 7540117, 11418480). Cell surface levels of FAS are frequently downregulated in cancer, allowing cells to evade programmed cell death (PMID: 15907590). Somatic FAS mutations are also found in a variety of tumor types including multiple myeloma, lymphomas, T cell leukemias, and several solid tumor types (PMID: 9373236, 9787134, 10190897, 11059754, 22042271). Mutations are frequently heterozygous and are predicted to be loss-of-function, allowing tumors to evade cell death via apoptosis (PMID: 22042271).",
    "Homo- and heterozygous deletion of the FAT1 locus on chromosome 4q35 leads to the loss of FAT1 expression and has been described in several tumors. Loss of FAT1 has been mechanistically associated with increased growth and invasion via beta-catenin mislocalization in both oral carcinomas and gliomas and has been shown to promote oncogenic WNT signaling and tumorigenesis (PMID: 21617878, 23354438)",
    ". FAT1 deletions have also been found at a low incidence in breast cancer and have been shown to be associated with resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition. Among 1,501 cases of ER+/HER2- breast cancer, FAT1 alterations were found in 2% of primary and 6% of metastatic cases. Patients with a deleterious FAT1 alteration, including deletions, who received CDK4/6-inhibitor therapy had a progression-free survival (PFS) of 2.4 months compared to 10.1 months for patients with wildtype (WT) FAT1 or FAT1 missense mutations. FAT1 knockdown and knockout in MCF7 breast cells demonstrated resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition, as shown by sustained cell proliferation in the presence of CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, as compared to WT MCF7 cells. In addition, FAT1 loss in MCF7 and CAMA-1 cells resulted in increased CDK6 protein expression through induction of the HIPPO pathway effectors, YAP and TAZ (PMID: 30537512)",
    "FAT1 is a transmembrane protein and member of the cadherin superfamily that is involved in planar cell polarity. FAT1 is involved in the promotion of actin-mediated cell migration as well as inhibition of YAP1-mediated cell proliferation. FAT1 is a potent suppressor of cancer cell growth, owing to its ability to bind β-catenin and abrogate its nuclear localization and transcription of its targets. Alterations in FAT1 decrease its interaction with β-catenin, thus promoting WNT signaling and tumorigenesis. Although most FAT1 alterations in cancer are loss-of-function events (cBioPortal, MSKCC, May 2015), studies suggest that it may be both tumor suppressive or oncogenic in a context-dependent manner (PMID: 8586420, 23076869, 19439659, 16682528, 23354438).",

FBXO11 directly binds SKP1 in the SCF complex and mediates substrate specific recognition (PMID: 16633365). BCL6 is a well-characterized target of SCF-mediated degradation and disruption of this complex results in BCL6 protein stabilization and transformation (PMID: 22113614). Loss of FBXO11 expression in murine models results in an expansion of germinal center B cells due to an overexpression of BCL6 (PMID: 27166359).

FBXW2 is an F-box protein containing WD-40 repeats that is responsible for substrate recognition, substrate binding and substrate specificity for the SCF complex (PMID: 30918250). The binding of SCF to its target proteins results in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target protein (PMID: 30918250). Thus, FBXW2 plays a pivotal role in post-translational protein regulation in the cell. FBXW2 is responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of proto-oncogenic substrates such as CTNNB1 (PMID: 30918250, 31211237), SKP2 (PMID: 31211237, 28090088), NF-κB p65 (PMID: 34465889) and EGFR (PMID: 35499593), which are instrumental in oncogenic processes in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer (PMID: 30918250, 31211237, 28090088, 34465889, 35499593). However, FBXW2 also downregulates inhibitory proteins of the SOX2 transcription factor and therefore plays a role in promoting cell stemness (PMID: 31548378), suggesting FBXW2 may have both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles.",

Upon substrate identification, this complex modifies the substrate such that it is targeted for protein degradation. Substrates of FBXW7 include the proteins c-MYC, mTOR (PMID: 18787170), NOTCH1, cyclin-E, and JUN, which are instrumental in the regulation of cell division, differentiation and growth, and which are often inappropriately activated in cancer. As most FBXW7 substrates are proto-oncogenes that are processed for degradation by the SCF complex, FBXW7 functions as a tumor suppressor. Inactivation of FBXW7 by mutation or copy number loss results in aberrant accumulation of oncoproteins, which subsequently contributes to malignant transformation (PMID: 18094723, 27399335). Alternate splicing of FBXW7 results in three distinct protein isoforms (α, β, γ) each with differential localization (PMID: 22673505).

    "FGFR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family. Binding of FGF ligands to FGFR1 results in the rapid dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways including the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways (PMID: 16597617). FGFR1 is widely expressed and is necessary for a variety of cellular functions such as embryonic development, skeletogenesis, mitogenesis and differentiation. Cell-type specific FGFR1 regulation is dependent on tissue distribution and ligand availability (PMID: 16597617). Germline mutations in FGFR1 are associated with congenic disorders that present with physical malformations, mental retardation and neurologic deficits (PMID: 23812909). Amplifying or activating mutations in FGFR1 occur in varying frequency in multiple cancers including those of the lung, breast, prostate, head and neck and esophagus (PMID: 21160078, 20179196, 14614009, 16807070, 12147242). In metastatic renal cell carcinoma, FGF signaling mediates acquired treatment resistance from VEGF-directed therapies (PMID: 24387233). Currently, a number of small molecule inhibitors of the FGFR proteins are in use, with the major difference among them being their specificity to FGFR versus other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (PMID: PMID: 23696246, 24265351).",
    "FGFR2 amplification is often associated with constitutive FGFR2 activation leading to increased tumor cell proliferation and survival. The oncogenic mechanism is likely increased downstream signaling through target pathways PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK, due to constitutive and ligand-independent receptor activation (PMID: 20094046)",
    ". FGFR2-IIIb specific antibody, GP369 has been used to support the findings that dysregulated FGFR signaling is one of the critical pathways involved in tumor maintenance and initiation. Patients with amplification of FGFR2 signaling could benefit from therapeutic intervention with FGFR2 inhibitors (PMID: 20709759)",
    ". This is especially seen in breast and gastric cancers and it has provided the rationale for targeting this pathway in clinical trials (PMID: 20101236)",

Binding of FGF ligands to FGFR2 results in the rapid dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways including the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways (PMID: 28030802). FGFR2 is expressed in ectoderm-derived and endothelial tissues and FGFR2 signaling contributes to a variety of cellular functions including homeostasis, mitogenesis, proliferation and differentiation (PMID: 20094046). Germline mutations in FGFR2 have been identified in syndromes of craniosynostosis, which are characterized by abnormal bone development (PMID: 29392564). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in FGFR2 are linked to the development of ER-positive breast cancer, although the etiology remains unclear (PMID: 18437204).

    "FH (fumarate hydratase, also known as fumarase) is an enzyme that converts fumarate to malate as part of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. FH exists in a mitochondrial and a cytosolic form, the former of which carries out FH's canonical role in the TCA cycle and the latter of which is likely involved in amino acid metabolism (PMID: 23643539, 14708972). The mitochondrial form of FH is determined by a C-terminal signal sequence (PMID: 18577574). Heterozygous germline mutations of FH cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC), an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by multiple cutaneous piloleiomyomas, uterine leiomyomas and papillary type 2 renal cancer (PMID: 20618355, 11865300, 15937070, 12772087, 16155190).

FLI1 inhibits Epo-induced differentiation of primary erythroblasts by binding and transcriptionally repressing the retinoblastoma gene (Rb), previously shown to be required for the development of mature erythrocytes from progenitor cells, and instead promotes proliferation of these cells (PMID: 10330185, 24320889). FLI1 is most commonly altered in Ewing sarcoma, where the EWSR1-FLI1 gene fusion is the most common chromosomal alteration leading to aberrant FLI1 expression, transcriptional activity and cell transformation in this tumor type (PMID: 8246959, 7517940, 25453903, 10197607).",

    "FLT1 (also VEGFRA) is a cell surface receptor that is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. Binding of the VEGF ligand, VEGFA, to FLT1 activates pathway signaling, which in turn regulates angiogenesis, cell survival, migration and invasion (PMID: 20127948). In addition, the VEGFA-FLT1 complex has been shown to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K/AKT signaling, and thus aberrant activation promotes tumor survival (PMID: 16116481, 20127948). FLT1 has also been shown to rescue tumor cells from hypoxia-induced stress (PMID: 16103078) and to regulate inflammatory response genes in macrophages associated with metastases (PMID: 26261265). Somatic mutations in FLT1 have been identified in a variety of tumor types, however, the impact of these alterations are not well-studied (PMID: 19718025, 2018). FLT1 overexpression and activation have been associated with increased transformation and invasion in colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer models (PMID: 14521839, 16397214, 16671089).

    "FLT3 is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that predominantly functions in the regulation of hematopoiesis (PMID: 12032772). FLT3 is activated following dimerization and autophosphorylation upon binding to its ligand, FLT3L. Activation of FLT3 results in downstream signaling via several pathways including the MAPK, PI3K/AKT and STAT3/5 pathways, which have key roles in hematopoietic proliferation, differentiation and survival (PMID: 23631653, 12951584). Wildtype FLT3 is important for the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and is commonly expressed on immature myeloid and lymphoid cells (PMID: 12951584). FLT3 alterations occur in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), most commonly presenting as FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) in about 25% of AMLs or point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain in about 7% of AMLs (PMID: 24319184). FLT3-ITD expression in murine models is not sufficient to cause leukemogenesis, however, additional oncogenic alterations cooperate with overactivation of FLT3 to cause malignancy (PMID: 25873173). FLT3 small molecule kinase inhibitors have been developed and are currently being tested in clinical trials, both alone and in combination with other epigenetic inhibitors (PMID: 24682858, 28193779).",
    "FLT4 (also VEGFR3) is a cell surface receptor that is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. Binding of the VEGF ligands, VEGF-C or VEGF-D, to FLT4 activates pathway signaling, which in turn mediates cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and resistance to chemotherapy in leukemia (PMID: 11877295, 16530705). In addition, FLT4 is a critical regulator of lymphangiogenesis and is necessary for the maintenance of the lymphatic endothelium (PMID: 10762646). Germline mutations in FLT4 have been identified in hereditary Nonne-Milroy disease, an autosomal dominant form of primary lymphedema type IA (PMID: 11292664). Aberrant FLT4 expression has been observed in several tumor types including lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 12875690) and colorectal adenocarcinoma (PMID: 12168824), among others, and has been shown to be hypermethylated in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (PMID: 28754676).

    "FOLH1, also known as PSMA, encodes for a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the M28 peptidase family (PMID: 29025989). FOLH1 functions as a glutamate carboxypeptidase and catalyzes hydrolytic cleavage of glutamates from peptides and small molecules (PMID: 15837926). The enzymatic activity of FOLH1 has been utilized for the design of FOLH1-selective substrate drugs, such as methotrexate, in which the inactive glutamate form of the drug is cleaved and activated only in tissue expressing FOLH1 (PMID: 15837926, 33499427, 33782486). Overexpression of FOLH1 in various cancer cell lines induces cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting that FOLH1 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 33748101, 24571890).

    "FOXA1 is a member of the Forkhead domain containing (FKHD) family of transcription factors (PMID: 19274050). FOXA1 binds to genomic DNA via the N-terminus of the protein and interacts with histone molecules via the C-terminal transactivating domain. Binding of FOXA1 to core histones H3/H4 facilitates the “pioneering activity” of FOXA1 by opening regions of condensed chromatin (PMID: 16909212); this allows for the recruitment of other transcription factors, including the androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) (PMID: 21934649). FOXA1 is normally expressed in a number of tissue types, including lung, liver, pancreas, colon, bladder, prostate and breast (PMID: 22115363). Expression of FOXA1 is required for normal prostate development and maturation, prostate specific gene expression and cellular differentiation through its direct interaction with AR and modulation of AR signaling (PMID: 15987773, 21934649, 22649425, 18358809). Luminal-specific deletion of FOXA1 in the mouse prostate results in high rates of epithelial cell proliferation and increased expression of basal cell markers (PMID: 24840332), indicating that FOXA1 may play a role in promoting and maintaining epithelial cell differentiation. FOXA1 is also required for normal mammary ductal morphogenesis and expression of ERα (PMID: 20501593). FOXA1 has emerged as one of the most frequent recurrently mutated genes in hormone-dependent cancers including primary and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and breast cancer (PMID: 25470049, 23000897, 22495314). FOXA1 is also frequently mutated in urothelial bladder carcinoma and amplified in a number of other tumor types (PMID: 24476821). Somatic FOXA1 mutations predominantly map to the DNA-binding domain, suggesting that they function as loss-of-function alterations (PMID: 25470049, 23000897, 22495314).",

In addition, FOXF1 has been implicated in a variety of cellular activities including ciliogenesis, cellular proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and metastasis (PMID: 30950350, 28623323). Sporadic and familial mutations in FOXF1 have been implicated in alveolar capillary dysplasia with misaligned pulmonary veins (ACDMPV), a congenital disease that results in respiratory failure (PMID: 31199666, 31074124, 30380203, 27071622, 23505205). These FOXF1 alterations are loss-of-function and lead to loss of STAT3-FOXF1 protein interactions and reduced chromatin binding (PMID: 31199666). FOXF1 activity has been found to be both increased and decreased in a variety of cancers, suggesting that FOXF1 may function as a tumor suppressor or oncogene depending on the cellular context (PMID: 27165781, 30253191, 30189360, 28623323, 27042124). In Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), FOXF1 regulates the expression of two genes, KIT and ETV1, by recruiting them to relevant target genes (PMID: 29162563).

FOXO1 plays an important role in the regulation of adipogenesis and differentiation of preadipocytes by binding to the promoter of PPARG, a key mediator of adipogenesis initiation (PMID: 12530968). In addition, FOXO1 is critical for regulating gluconeogenesis via insulin signaling (PMID: 10702299) and for maintaining pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (PMID: 24116102). FOXO1 activity is repressed after phosphorylation by AKT, leading to exclusion of FOXO1 from the nucleus and, in some contexts, apoptosis (PMID: 17646672). CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 is also important for the regulation of cell cycle progression (PMID: 17038621).

Appropriate expression of GATA2 is required in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to initiate hematopoietic lineage specification (PMID: 28179280). Importantly, GATA2 regulates the activation of GATA1, a process termed the “GATA switch”, which then ultimately results in the repression of GATA2 (PMID: 12857954). Loss of GATA2 expression in murine models results in the suppression of definitive hematopoiesis, highlighting the importance of GATA2 in hematopoietic regulation (PMID: 8078582).

Following activation by a GPCR, GDP-bound GNA11 (a Gαq protein) exchanges GDP for GTP and activates downstream signaling via binding to phospholipase C β (PLCB4), (PMID: 27089179, 28223438). PLCB4 activates PIP2 cleavage, resulting in activation of the second messenger proteins diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) to prompt calcium release (PMID: 27089179). GNA11-mediated signaling promotes the activation of a variety of downstream pathways, including PKC, MAPK, and PI3K signaling, which mediate several cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (PMID: 27089179, 23177739). GNA11 alterations inhibit the GTPase hydrolysis activity of the protein, thereby causing GNA11 to remain bound to GTP in a constitutively activated state (PMID: 24077403, 21083380).

When bound to GDP, the alpha and beta-gamma subunits form an inhibitory complex; subsequently, binding by an activated G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) can initiate dissociation of the alpha subunit from the beta-gamma complex, resulting in the exchange of GDP for GTP (PMID: 19226283). GNB1 remains bound to a gamma subunit and functions as an activated effector molecule mediating downstream signaling, including activation of the PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and PLCβ pathways (PMID: 18814923, 19226283). Germline alterations in GNB1 are associated with a neurological disorder that presents as a developmental delay with seizures (PMID: 27108799). Somatic GNB1 mutations are found in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 25485910). GNB1 alterations impact the G protein alpha and beta-gamma binding surface, resulting in activation of signaling downstream of G proteins and resistance to targeted kinase inhibitors (PMID: 25485910).",
    "GPS2 truncating mutations can form several forms of C-terminally truncated GPS2 proteins. GPS2 mutations are found in patients with breast cancer. Knockdown of GPS2 in the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, demonstrated that GPS2 loss may be oncogenic as shown by increased estrogen receptor target gene expression and increased cell proliferation compared with control knockdown cells (PMID: 19858209, 30096302)",
    ", suggesting that inactivation by truncating mutation may also be oncogenic.",
    "GPS2 (also known as AMF1) is a transcriptional cofactor in the G protein-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. GPS2 interacts with transcription factors, nuclear receptors and histone acetyltransferases, thereby regulating transcriptional repression and activation (PMID: 11931768, 11486030, 17895379, 19481530, 24953653, 18218630, 10846067). GPS2 is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to both the nucleus, where it acts as a modulator of transcription, and the cytoplasm, where it modulates proinflammatory TNFα signaling and JNK activity (PMID: 22424771, 19858209, 11486030, 16122992, 20159957). Somatic loss-of-function mutations in GPS2 are found in medulloblastoma and are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that GPS2 functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 22820256, 25030029). Translocations have also been observed in glioblastoma multiforme and undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma (PMID: 23917401, 25139254).",
    "GREM1 encodes for gremlin 1, a DAN (differential screening selected gene abberative in neuroblastoma) family bone morphogenic protein (BMP) antagonist (PMID: 24810382). It is a secreted protein that binds to BMP ligands to prevent BMP receptor activation (PMID: 25378054). It regulates kidney formation, skeletal development, and the osteochondroreticular stem cell, responsible for making osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and reticular marrow stromal cells (PMID: 17522159, 21303853, 25594183, 15201225). It is expressed in various tumor cells and in glioma cells acts to maintain stem cell potential (PMID: 24788093, 23826422, 17003113). A duplication including the upstream region of the GREM1 gene is associated with Hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome and an increased risk of developing colon cancer (PMID: 22561515). This duplication causes ectopic expression of GREM1 in the colonic epithelium and acquisition of stem cell capacity in more mature progenitor cells (PMID: 25419707).",
    "Somatic mutations in GRIN2A were identified in ~25% of malignant melanoma samples following whole exome sequence analysis, and functional characterization of truncating or nonsense GRIN2A mutants [W372*, Q891*, W1271*, R920K] revealed reduced binding and loss of NMDA receptor complex formation between GRIN1 and mutant GRIN2A. GRIN2A mutants demonstrated increased anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and increased migration. Knockdown of GRIN2A expression in melanoma cells resulted in increased proliferation of cells bearing wildtype, but not mutant, GRIN2A. These GRIN2A somatic loss-of-function mutations exerted a dominant negative effect and inhibited the tumor suppressive phenotype of wildtype GRIN2A in melanoma (PMID: 24739903)",
    "GRIN2A, also known as GluN2A or NR2A, is a regulatory subunit of the glutamate-gated N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which plays an important role in cell death, survival, and migration in cancer cells (PMID: 23540692). NMDARs are best known for their roles in the brain, and high expression is found in neurons in the brain and the spinal cord where they play an important role in controlling cation flow through the receptor (PMID: 7512349). Normal NMDAR activity can promote cell survival in neurons through the PI3K and ERK signaling pathways (PMID: 11902114). Studies have shown a high prevalence of somatic mutations in GRIN2A in malignant melanoma (PMID: 21499247, 22197930), although the mechanism or function of these mutations is still unknown.",
    "GRM3 encodes for metabotropic glutamate receptor 3, which belongs to group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (PMID: 27130562). Group II receptors are linked to the inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade ( PMID: 27431857). The G-protein coupled receptor modulates synaptic glutamate and is involved in synaptic plasticity and brain function (PMID: 27130562). Mutations in GRM3 have been associated with psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (PMID: 15310849, 27130562, 27431857). Alterations in GRM3 have been associated with neurological conditions rather than cancer. However, increased GRM3 expression has been observed in patients with glioblastoma and activating mutations in GRM3 have been identified in melanoma cells (PMID: 34290229, 21946352).",
    "GSK3B is a multifunctional serine /threonine kinase that is a member of the glycogen synthase kinase protein family. The protein kinase functions as an important regulator of cellular signaling pathways involved in metabolism, cell cycle and proliferation (PMID: 24931005). Unlike most protein kinases, GSK3β is constitutively active in resting cells and undergoes a rapid and transient inhibition in response to a number of external signals. GSK3β activity is regulated by site-specific phosphorylation. Several kinases are capable of regulating the protein kinase including p70 S6 kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p90Rsk, protein kinases A, B and C, and MEK1/2 (PMID: 12615961, 11527574, 16935409, 11394906, 15020233). Dysregulated GSK3B has been implicated in the development of a number of human diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases and bipolar disorder (PMID: 12615961, 11527574, 16935409). Overexpression of the protein kinase has also been implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer progression including ovarian, colon, liver and pancreatic carcinomas (PMID: 16556076, 17912008, 11883528, 16556076, 16342409, 18606491). Several GSK3β inhibitors have been studied in preclinical trials, for example pharmacological inhibitors suppress proliferation of the ovarian cancer cells in vitro and prevents the formation of tumors in nude mice generated by the inoculation of human ovarian cancer cells (PMID: 16788573).",
    "GTF2I (also TFII-I) is a general transcription factor that regulates the transcription of several signaling proteins (PMID: 22037610, 22037610). GTF2I mediates the expression of various genes important in cell cycle control, stress response, and genomic stability, including FOS, BRCA, and STAT proteins, among other others, in association with a variety of transcriptional complexes (PMID: 28657656, 24922507, 24231951, 21407215). GTF2I has also been implicated in heavy chain immunoglobulin transcription in immune cells and plays an important role in T-cell receptor signaling (PMID: 21549311, 11313464, 19701889). In addition, GTF2I can directly bind CTCF, a regulator of epigenetic state, to drive transcriptional initiation at target genes (PMID: 25646466). Germline deletions in GTF2I are found in patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome, a multisystem developmental disorder (PMID: 10198167). Somatic GTF2I mutations have been identified in epithelial thymic tumors and follicular T cell-derived lymphomas (PMID: 24974848, 27369867). GTF2I mutations occur predominantly as missense mutations and are predicted to disrupt protein degradation of GTF2I, leading to increased protein expression (PMID: 24974848). These alterations tend to occur in more indolent thymic tumor subtypes and are associated with a better prognosis (PMID: 28676218).",
    "The H1-2 S102F mutation occurs within the highly conserved H1-2 globular domain. Expression of S102F mutant H1-2 in mouse embryonic stem cells resulted in dramatically impaired association with chromatin relative to wildtype, suggesting that the mutation likely reduces the binding affinity and residence time of these H1 subtypes in chromatin. This in turn may compromise chromatin compaction and specific gene regulation (PMID: 24362818)",
    "H1-2 is a histone H1 variant. H1 histone proteins bind to linker DNA between nucleosomes and influences higher order chromatin structure. The histone H1 family comprises eleven members, each one transcribed by its own gene. A number of studies have shown that H1 levels are altered in cancer and variant-specific changes can be observed in different tumor types. Although H1 variants share significant homology in their globular DNA-binding domain, they are more divergent in their C- and N-terminal tails, and evidence suggests that they may have distinct functions in the nucleus. The so-called “main” H1 variants, which include H1-1, H1-2, H1-3, H1-4, H1-5, H1-6, are mainly transcribed in S-phase and therefore expressed at high levels only in dividing cells (PMID: 18208346, 26474902, 26386351). H1-2 mutations have been identified in follicular lymphoma and impair H1-2 binding to DNA, likely impacting chromatin structure and gene expression (PMID: 24362818).",

    "H1-3 is a histone H1 linker protein that encodes the non-canonical H1.3 histone variant (PMID: 9031620). Histone variants, such as H1.3, have sequences that differ from the canonical histone protein and appear to be interchangeable with the major protein form (PMID: 9031620). Histone proteins are an essential component of the nucleosome which consists of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones), and therefore allow for the effective packaging of DNA in the nucleus (PMID: 11498575). In addition to the core histone molecules, H1 linker histones mediate the stabilization of histone molecules and higher order chromatin state (PMID: 9031620). H1-3 expression is replication-dependent and H1-3 is most highly expressed in the thymus, lung, and spleen (PMID: 28794128). H1-3 is detected on chromatin throughout the cell cycle (PMID: 20104577), is depleted at active promoters and regulatory units (PMID: 21852237), suppresses RAD51/RAD54-mediated homologous pairing (PMID: 26757249) and directly mediates chromatin compaction (PMID: 19794910). H1-3 is also a member of an HDAC3 containing complex that mediates the repression of the retinoic acid receptor and the thyroid hormone receptor (PMID: 26663086). Somatic mutations in H1-3 are rare; however, overexpression of H1-3 has been associated with repression of the oncogenic factor H19 in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting it functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 28687618, 25205099).",

H1-4 expression is replication-dependent and is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of cell types (PMID: 28794128). Expression of H1-4 is gender-specific and is enriched on the paternal inactive chromosome (PMID: 18927631). H1-4 mediates the binding of the repressive protein HP1α and is depleted from active regulatory regions of the chromatin (PMID: 30007360, 23746450). Loss of HISTH1E in breast cancer cells results in growth suppression, suggesting a role in cell survival (PMID: 18927631).

H1-5 expression is replication-dependent and H1-5 is most highly expressed in the thymus and spleen (PMID: 28794128). H1-5 binds chromatin in the embryonic germ layers and binding is progressively lost during epigenetic reprogramming (PMID: 28794128, 28794128). In differentiated cells, H1-5 regulates chromatin structure near genes that encode membrane or membrane-associated proteins (PMID: 22956909). H1-5 has been implicated in the repression of gene expression and a regulator of SIRT1 deacetylase activity (PMID: 22956909). Depletion of H1-5 results in loss of SIRT1 binding, loss of H3K9me2, increased chromatin accessibility and decreased cellular growth (PMID: 22956909). H1-5 has also been shown to bind FOXP3 in T regulatory cells at relevant target genes (PMID: 21654845). Rare somatic mutations in H1-5 have been identified in colon cancer and are predicted to maintain a more undifferentiated chromatin state (PMID: 16959974).

    "HDAC1 is a histone deacetylase that is termed a Class I HDAC, in a family with HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 (PMID: 27599530). Histone deacetylases remove the acetyl group from relevant lysine amino acids on either histone or non-histone cellular substrates, altering epigenetic state and gene transcription (PMID: 24691964). HDAC1 activity regulates several key cellular functions including apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA damage response, and metastasis (PMID: 22147512, 27599530). In addition, HDAC1 deacetylates tumor suppressors and oncogenes, including TP53, HIF-1α, MLL and NK-kB (PMID: 11931769, 12829790), impacting their activity. Knockdown of HDAC1 expression in preclinical models results in an anti-proliferative effect, leading to an induction in p21 and p27 and repression of several cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (PMID: 22496786). Somatic HDAC1 mutations are found in patients with liposarcoma (PMID: 22328974); however, alterations tend to be rare in human cancers. Increased expression of HDAC1 is associated with poor outcomes in several tumor types including gastric and ovarian cancers, among others (PMID: 25482492).

HDAC2 is a component of multiple corepressor complexes and functions in transcriptional repression of various genes involved in physiological cellular processes (PMID: 12724404, 12493763, 10888872). Overexpression of HDAC2 in various cancer cell lines and models induces cellular proliferation, dysregulation of G1/S cell cycle progression and decreased apoptosis, suggesting that HDAC2 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 34365463, 23175521, 22492270).

    "HDAC4 is a histone deacetylase that is termed a Class IIa HDAC, in a family with HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 (PMID: 27599530). Histone deacetylases remove the acetyl group from relevant lysine amino acids on either histone or non-histone cellular substrates, altering epigenetic state and gene transcription (PMID: 24691964). HDAC4 activity regulates several key cellular functions including cell cycle, DNA damage response and angiogenesis (PMID: 12668657, 19071119). Expression of 53BP1, a DNA damage protein, co-localizes with HDAC4 and regulates the DNA damage-induced G2 checkpoint (PMID: 12668657). Additionally, HDAC4 transcriptionally activates HIF-1α (PMID: 19071119). Somatic HDAC4 mutations are rare in human cancers; however, HDAC4 is predicted to function as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in different cellular contexts. Deletions in HDAC4 are found in patients with melanoma (PMID: 21571862) while overexpression of HDAC4 is associated with gastric and acute lymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 25091122, 23948281). A variety of pan-HDAC inhibitors are FDA-approved for the treatment of several cancers including vorinostat (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), panobinostat (multiple myeloma), and belinostat (peripheral T cell lymphoma).

    "HGF (hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor) is a multidomain protein that directly binds to the tyrosine kinase MET, which leads to its dimerization and activation (PMID: 3319692, 2531289). HGF is primarily expressed as pro-HGF and needs proteolytic activation to form HGF (PMID: 22270953, 1826653). MET activation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream activation of various effector proteins such as PLC, GAB1, GRB2 and SRC. HGF/MET signaling is physiolgically required for liver and skin regeneration as well as Epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) in embryogenesis. In cancer, HGF/MET signaling is involved in stemness, metastasis and angiogenesis (PMID: 22270953). Downstream effectors in the context of cancer involve the WNT-beta-catenin pathway, PI3K-AKT as well as TGFbeta signalling. A number of small molecule and antibody based MET receptor inhibitors have been developed and are tested in clinical trials with variable results.",
    "HIF1A is a transcription factor subunit that mediates gene expression in hypoxic conditions (PMID: 13130303). HIF-1, a transcriptional activator that is stabilized in the absence of oxygen, is composed of HIF1A, an oxygen-regulated subunit, and HIF1B, a ubiquitously expressed subunit (PMID: 20965423). In normoxic conditions, the E3 ligase VHL ubiquitinates and targets HIF1A to the proteasome for degradation via binding coordinated by hydroxylation (PMID: 13130303). Normal oxygen levels also preclude the binding of the transcriptional activators p300 and CBP to HIF1A, inhibiting HIF1A-dependent transcriptional activation (PMID: 24421387). In hypoxic conditions, VHL can no longer bind HIF1A due to loss of hydroxylation, resulting in protein stabilization of HIF1A (PMID: 13130303). HIF1A regulates an extensive network of transcriptional activity during hypoxia including regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, cell survival, apoptosis, metabolism, angiogenesis, and cell adhesion, among others (PMID: 13130303, 28741521, 26955619). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a gene involved in angiogenesis, is the most well-established HIF1A transcriptional target; most other transcriptional changes are context dependent. Somatic mutations in HIF1A are rare in human cancers; however, overexpression of HIF1A is found in many tumor types. Intratumoral hypoxia is common in malignant tumors, and increased HIF1A expression has been identified in tumors that have mutations in relevant hypoxia-related genes such as VHL (PMID: 26955619, 24446253).",

    "HIRA encodes for a histone chaperone that functions in nucleosome assembly with the H3.3 histone variant (PMID: 16251970). HIRA colocalizes with other histone-binding proteins such as UBN1, CABIN1 and ASF1a to form the HIRA chaperone complex and deposit histone H3.3 at its binding sites (PMID: 23602572). HIRA functions in the repression of histone gene transcription during the cell cycle to trigger a block of DNA synthesis (PMID: 12370293). Deficiency in HIRA in various types of cancer cell types and models induces cellular proliferation and invasion, suggesting that HIRA functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 36269833, 11238922, 25512559).

    "HLA-A is a heavy chain subunit of the major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) complex. A critical component of the immune system is the presentation of foreign antigens on the cell surface by the MHC molecules (PMID: 10974135). Tumor cells are vulnerable to such an immune response due to the presentation of tumor-specific antigens, such as mutated oncoproteins, on the cell surface (PMID: 24782321, 24244023, 23157435). Several types of tumors are known to evade such an immunological response by crippling the levels of MHC I-presenting antigens on the tumor cell surface (PMID: 24782321, 24244023, 23157435, 11665717). The HLA-A genes encode for the heavy chain subunit of the MHC (PMID: 22434516). A reduction in HLA-A levels is seen in many tumors, which may be due to factors like genomic alteration, transcriptional regulation, protein transportation, and oncogene regulation (PMID: 24244023, 11665717). Genomic alterations are observed only rarely; chromosomal loss resulting in loss of the HLA locus is observed in 13.8% of colon tumors, 17.6% of laryngeal tumors, 15.3% of melanoma tumors and 17.2% of epithelial squamous cell carcinomas (PMID: 9057360). In HCT116 colorectal cancer cells HLA-A1 and HLA-A2 are down regulated by DNA methylation and by the action of the MEK pathway (PMID: 19569244). Similarly, gastric and esophageal cancers also display HLA-A downregulation via action of RAS, MYC and the HER2 oncogene, as well as the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway (PMID: 24244023, 20715101, 20628381).",

A critical component of the immune system is the presentation of foreign antigens on the cell surface by the MHC molecules (PMID: 10974135, 15719024). Immune recognition leads to the stimulation of a signaling cascade that results in apoptosis of MHC-presenting target cells (PMID: 15719024). Tumor cells are vulnerable to such an immune response due to the presentation of tumor-specific antigens such as mutated oncoproteins on the cell surface (PMID: 24782321, 24244023, 23157435). HLA-B is anchored in the membrane of most cells, and it has a highly polymorphic region that facilitates a wide binding specificity for a variety of antigens that need to be presented to cytotoxic immune T cells (PMID: 25493333).

    "HLA-C is a heavy chain subunit of the major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) complex. HLA-C is one of the three MHC I surface receptors that function as a heterodimer in collaboration with β-microglobulin to regulate immune responses (PMID: 15719024). A critical component of the immune system is the presentation of foreign antigens on the cell surface by the MHC molecules (PMID: 10974135, 15719024). Immune recognition leads to the stimulation of a signaling cascade that results in apoptosis of MHC-presenting target cells (PMID: 15719024). Tumor cells are vulnerable to such an immune response due to the presentation of tumor-specific antigens such as mutated oncoproteins on the cell surface (PMID: 24782321, 24244023, 23157435). HLA-C molecules are highly polymorphic and the breadth of these repertoires can predispose to autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis (PMID: 28855257, 16642438). Several types of tumors are known to evade an immunological response by downregulating the levels of MHC I-presenting antigens on the tumor cell surface (PMID: 24782321, 24244023, 23157435, 11665717). A reduction in HLA-C levels in cancer could occur due to many factors including mutation, transcriptional downregulation, epigenetic silencing and protein stability, among others (PMID: 26796069, 26372948, 31564637).

    "HMGA2, or HMGI-C, encodes a chromatin remodeling protein that binds to DNA through AT-hook DNA binding domains, allowing recruitment of transcription factor and histone modification proteins to remodel chromatin and modulate gene expression (PMID: 1692833, 3456586). HMGA2 regulates the transcriptional activity of genes, such as cyclin A and ERCC1, through binding to specific AT-rich sites at the gene promoter region (PMID: 14645522, 14627817). HMGA2 expression is upregulated widely in undifferentiated cells during embryogenesis, and eventually expression is downregulated or absent in tissues over the course of fetal development and into adulthood (PMID: 7651535). Overexpression of HMGA2 in cancer cell lines and mice results in tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting that HMGA2 predominantly functions as an oncogene (PMID: 25014774, 10945639). HMGA2 amplification has been identified in various cancer types, including esophageal squamous carcinoma, colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer (PMID: 27027341, 21252160, 17600087).

    "HNF1A is a liver-specific transcription factor that is a member of the hepatocyte nuclear factor protein family. HNF1A, together with other hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF4A, HNF6) forms tissue-specific regulatory circuits and acts as master regulators of liver and pancreatic islet transcription (PMID: 14988562). HNF1A-/- mice showed defects in hepatic function, renal Fanconi syndrome, type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia (PMID: 11279518). Heterozygous germline mutations in HNF1A cause Maturity Onset Diabetes of Young or MODY3 (PMID: 8945470). Bi-allelic somatic inactivating mutations and deletions in HNF1A are seen in about 40-50% of hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) (PMID: 12355088). Two HNF1A mutations, W206 (DNA binding domain) and P291 (Trans-activation domain), have been found over represented across different studies (PMID: 16496320, 20393147, 12355088). Among them, W206 is unique to HCA while P291 is common to both HCA and MODY. In rare cases of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), HNF1A mutations were seen in combination with other genetic alterations (PMID: 12355088).",
    "HNF1B, a member of the homeobox-containing basic helix-turn-helix family, encodes for a DNA-binding transcription factor that forms a homodimer or heterodimer with HNF1A (PMID: 1763325, 7900999). HNF1B regulates various cellular processes, such as cellular differentiation, apoptosis and autophagy, through the repression and activation of target genes (PMID: 28622294, 25715395). Alterations of HNF1B are found in a large percentage of dominant inherited nephropathy (PMID: 33305128, 21775974). The oncogenic function of HNF1B is likely tissue-specific. Ectopic expression of HNF1B in prostate cancer and serous ovarian carcinoma cell lines suppresses cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that HNF1B functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene in this tissue context (PMID: 31636385, 33174391, 24105991). Downregulation of HNF1B has been identified in renal cancer, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, kidney chromophobe and lung squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 15168014, 28807937, 33173410). Conversely, upregulation of HNF1B has been identified in bladder urothelial carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, thyroid carcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (PMID: 33173410).",

    "HOXB13 is a member of the homeobox (HOX) gene family, which is a group of clustered transcription factors that are evolutionarily conserved and crucial for embryonic development along the anterior-posterior axis (PMID: 1346368). In addition to regulating body axis patterning in embryos, HOXB13 has roles in the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and cell cycle activity (PMID: 28798948). HOXB13 mediates gene expression in a cell-type specific manner due to variation in interactions with adaptor molecules. HOXB13 has been implicated in prostate cell identity, and mice lacking HOXB13 have prostate defects (PMID: 12668621). HOXB13 functions through the androgen receptor (AR) in both normal adult tissue and prostate cancer by regulating the chromatin state around the AR gene, and can have both growth-enhancing or growth-suppressing effects depending on context (PMID: 15604291, 19917249). Germline HOXB13 mutations have been found in familial prostate cancer and are predictive of prostate cancer risk (PMID: 22236224), while somatic HOXB13 mutations have been identified in several other cancer types (PMID: 28798948). Though HOXB13 is overexpressed during malignant progression of prostate and breast cancer (PMID: 20018680), it is downregulated in colorectal and renal cell cancer models, suggesting that it has context-specific effects in human tumors (PMID: 15928669, 16278676, 15193263, 17453342, 23832664).",

    "HRAS (Harvey Ras) is a membrane-associated GTPase. It plays an important role as an upstream mediator of several pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3 kinase (PI3K) pathways. HRAS, NRAS and KRAS comprise the Ras proto-oncogene family, and all three have a similar structure and function. Transforming, gain-of-function mutations of RAS oncogenes tend to disrupt GTPase activity and promote cell proliferation and angiogenesis (PMID: 12778136). Overexpression of oncogenic HRAS also triggers growth factor-independent cell cycle progression and upregulation of proteins implicated in tumor growth (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9). HRAS mutations are found most commonly in cancers of the thyroid, salivary glands, bladder urinary tract, cervix and prostate (PMID: 21993244, 22589270). Patients with Costello syndrome, a hereditary disorder with germline alterations in HRAS, can develop various malignancies at a young age, including neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (PMID: 22261753, 16170316). RAS mutations (including HRAS) have been found in a significant proportion of RET negative medullary thyroid cancer (PMID: 21325462, 23240926, 22865907, 23264394). And while multikinase inhibitors that include HRAS among its targets are FDA-approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer, the FDA-approval is not based on the HRAS mutant status, therefore not explicitly meeting the OncoKB Level 1 criteria.",
    "Truncating mutations of HSD17B2 occur throughout the protein and typically result in the loss of protein expression. In vitro studies with various prostate cancer cell lines expressing truncated HSD17B2 isoforms through alternative splicing demonstrate that HSD17B2 truncation mutations are inactivating as measured by increased protein degradation compared to full-length HSD17B2 (PMID: 30228209)",

The anti-estrogenic and anti-androgenic function of HSD17B2 maintains cell cycle homeostasis through negative regulation of hormone-induced proliferation and differentiation in endometrial tissue (PMID: 18270252). Overexpression of HSD17B2 in prostate cancer cell lines suppresses cell proliferation and xenograft growth, suggesting that HSD17B2 functions primarily as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 30228209).

    "The IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) protein is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a crucial step in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDH1 utilizes NADP(+) as an electron acceptor and it is predominantly expressed in the cytosol and peroxisomes, playing a role in the cytoplasmic production of NADPH. Cancer-associated mutations in the catalytic site of IDH1 confer a gain-of-function of neomorphic enzymatic activity, allowing the mutant enzyme to convert α-KG to the “oncometabolite” D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (PMID: 20171147). 2-HG promotes tumor development by inhibiting a variety of enzymes that require α-KG as a substrate, including enzymes involved in DNA demethylation, histone demethylation, adaptation to hypoxia and collagen maturation. IDH1 mutations have been identified in glioma, cholangiocarcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) among others (PMID: 19657110, 23630074) and may contribute to the progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to bone marrow failure or AML (PMID: 29355841).",

IDH2 mutations have been identified in hematologic malignancies, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as in solid tumors such as gliomas and cholangiocarcinomas, and may contribute to the progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to bone marrow failure or AML (PMID: 29355841)..",
    "IFNAR1 encodes the protein interferon alpha and beta receptor subunit 1, which, along with the IFNAR2 subunit, composes the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) (PMID: 33552080, 24362405). Binding of type I interferons to the receptor activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway resulting in transcriptional activation or repression of interferon-regulated genes. IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 form a heterodimer complex and are associated with tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) and JAK1, respectively, which are required for STAT recruitment to the receptor complex. STAT proteins are phosphorylated by the JAKs, which promote their translocation to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (PMID: 24362405, 22410872, 33552080, 32378445, 30555157). IFNAR is widely expressed in lymphocytes, natural killer cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMID: 36063748). The protein encoded by INFAR1 also functions as an antiviral factor (PMID: 24362405, 30555157). Inhibition of IFNAR1 signaling in natural killer cells has been demonstrated to promote virus clearance (PMID: 33771858). Elevated levels of IFNAR1 have been associated with poor prognosis in breast and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, while in colorectal cancer elevated levels are positively associated with T-cell infiltration and better response to chemotherapy (PMID: 36063748, 30555157, 32378445). Overexpression of IFNAR1 in mammary adenocarcinoma cells results in elevated PD-L1 expression, suggesting pro-tumorigenic effects in this context (PMID: 32378445).",
    "IFNGR1 is a high-affinity subunit of the interferon-γ (IFN-γ) receptor, which is required by macrophages for killing intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria. After binding to interferon-γ, two IFNGR1 molecules form a heterodimeric complex with two IFNGR2 molecules, which initiates interferon signaling. IFNGR1 binds JAK1, and stimulation of the interferon response results in downstream activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (PMID: 22410872). Three cases of malignancy have been reported in patients with complete IFNGR1 deficiency: human herpesvirus-8 associated Kaposi sarcoma (PMID: 15069403), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) related B-cell lymphoma (PMID: 23800860) and pineal germinoma, an intracranial tumor (PMID: 25216720). Mutations in IFNGR1 can result in enhanced susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, and low expression of IFNGR1 leads to a functional blockade of IFN-γ signaling (PMID: 15589309). Somatic mutations in IFNGR1 have not yet been identified in human cancers, however, IFNGR1 expression is reduced in some breast cancers (PMID: 22182699) and downregulated in a subset of metastatic prostate cancers (PMID: 24953652). In addition, IFNGR1 deletions have been identified in patients with metastatic melanoma that are non-responders to anti-CTLA4 immunotherapies (PMID: 27667683).",
    "IGF1 is an insulin-like growth factor that signals through the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) and the insulin receptor (IR). The main function of IGF1 is to stimulate growth in a wide array of tissues. IGF1 is broadly expressed however the liver produces the majority of circulating IGF1 in response to GH secreted by the pituitary. Circulating IGF1 is bound to IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), e.g. IGFBP3, and only the free IGF1 is biologically active. In epidemiologic studies, high circulating levels of IGF1 and low levels of IGFBP3 have been associated with breast, prostate, colon, lung, and genitourinary cancers (PMID: 9593409, 9365156, 9438850, 10203281, 9923856). Genetic variation in the 3-prime region of the IGF1 gene may contribute to increased circulating IGF1 levels (PubMed: 17911177). Tissues can regulate levels of IGF1R and IGFBPs to modify IGF1 signaling and alterations in this local control may result in cancer (PMID: 23569026).",
    "The IGF1R R10L mutation is found at the N-terminus of the protein. Endogenous expression of this mutation in fibroblasts derived from a patient with severe growth retardation demonstrated that it was inactivating, as shown by impaired IGF1R autophosphorylation as compared to control fibroblasts with wildtype IGF1R (PMID: 23045302)",
    "IGF1R is an insulin-like growth factor receptor (PMID: 19029956), a tyrosine kinase which activates downstream pathways involved in growth and cell survival. IGF1R binds several ligands, including high affinity ligands (insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1)) and low-affinity ligands (insulin, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2)) (PMID: 12360255, 19029956, 22337149). Binding to ligands activates two oncogenic pathways, the PI3-kinase/AKT pathway and the RAS-MAPK pathway (PMID: 25984556). Missense mutations of IGF1R are observed across the entire gene body, and several of these mutations have been linked to changes in the basal activity of IGF1R (PMID: 22778948). IGF1R is over-expressed in several cancers, and its over-expression in cell lines can induce transformation (PMID: 9196021). IGF1R is frequently mutated/amplified across a variety of cancer types (frequency ~8%) (cBioPortal, Nov 2015, PMID: 25984556). Binding of ligand to IGF1R has been reported to mediate both resistance and sensitivity to both targeted and cytotoxic therapy across a number of cancer types (PMID: 25984556, 22337149). Various therapeutics have been developed to target IGF1R, either as monoclonal antibodies against IGF1R or IGF1R ligands, or as inhibitors of the kinase activity of IGF1R, but these therapeutics have shown limited success in large clinical trials (PMID: 23601239, 24338270).",
    "IGF2 is an insulin growth factor which binds to receptor tyrosine kinases to activate downstream mitogenic signaling pathways (PMID: 24080445, 25704323). IGF2 binds to one of several receptor tyrosine kinases, including IGF1R and IR-A, to initiate a cascade that activates mitogenic and metabolic signaling via the PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways (PMID: 24080445). In most adult tissues IGF2 is imprinted, and thus its expression is restricted to the paternal allele only (PMID: 12637750). Aberrant IGF2 expression, in many cases due to loss of imprinting, is implicated in the development of several tumor types (e.g. breast, ovarian, and Wilms tumors) (PMID: 17686827, 24080445), as well as the progression of tumors to more aggressive disease (e.g. breast cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia) (PMID: 20089431, 9558368, 24080445). Loss-of-imprinting of IGF2 is causative for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which confers an increased risk of developing childhood tumors such as Wilms’ tumor and hepatoblastoma (PMID: 8968759, 12668598, 23620526). Overexpression of IGF2 is also a critical event in non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (PMID: 24616774, 24080445).",
    "IKBKE amplification is a rare event occurring across a few tumor types with higher frequencies observed in adrenocortical carcinoma, nerve sheath tumors, breast cancer and uterine sarcoma (cBioPortal, Zehir, A et al. Nature Medicine, 2017). IKBKE amplification has been observed in breast tumors and human cell line models for the disease and is associated with IKBKE overexpression, augmented cellular proliferation and increased oncogenicity (PMID: 25365225, 17574021)",
    ". This suggests an oncogenic role for the amplification of IKBKE, likely attributable to its role in the regulation of NFκB signaling.",
    "Inhibitor of Kappa Light Polypeptide Gene Enhancer in B-Cell, Kinase Epsilon (IKBKE) is a serine/threonine kinase that has important functions in the regulation of inflammatory responses to infection as well as cancer (PMID: 23333767, 19160540). It is activated in cells that are infected with virus and as a result associates with DDX3X and phophorylates its target protein such as interferon regulatory factors (IRF3, IRF7) (PMID: 23333767, 19160540). As a result of their phosphorylation IRFs translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral genes such as IFNB. IKBKE also phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B leading to their degredation and further enhancing pro-inflammatory responses (PMID: 23333767, 19160540). It is overexpressed in >30% of primary breast cancer and amplifications affecting IKBKE locus have been observed (PMID: 23333767, 21042276, 17574021). IKBKE has been shown to exhibit oncogenic functions through the phosphorylation of CYLD at serine 418 and TRAF2 at serine 11(PMID: 19481526, 23007157). Additionally IKBKE also phosphorylates NF-kappa-B and AKT1 leading to higher NF-kappa-B activity (PMID: 21908616, 21464307). IKBKE has also been implicated in several other tumor entities (PMID: 22942254, 19497997, 20001340, 21271611, 22266464). Recently, IKBKE inhibitors have been developed and are currently tested pre-clinically (PMID: 22305584, 23099093, 19426678).",
    "IKZF1 deletions occur in pediatric and adult patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Several studies reported an association of IKZF1 deletion with unfavorable prognosis, especially for patients negative for BCR-ABL1 translocation. Gene expression profiling of patients with IKZF1-deleted ALL who had a poor outcome suggested that IKZF1 impairment is associated with an increased expression of hematopoietic stem-cell genes and a reduced expression of B-cell-lineage associated genes (PMID: 19129520, 26202931, 27067989, 27815723)",

    "The IKZF1 gene encodes the Ikaros family zinc finger 1 transcription factor (IKZF1). IKZF1 functions in hematopoietic stem cells to induce lymphoid specification and differentiation (PMID: 19345118, 16518393). As a transcription factor, IKZF1 alters chromatin and regulates gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylases and chromatin remodeling ATPases to target genes (PMID: 10204490). IKZF1 is the target of lenalidomide-induced degradation in multiple myeloma and its degradation is a key component of the drug's activity in myeloma (PMID: 24292625). IKZF1 mutations and deletions are most commonly found in B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) and may be a mechanism of leukemic transformation in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (BCR-ABL) B-ALLs (PMID: 17344859, 18408710). Mutation of IKZF1 is associated with poor prognosis in B-ALL (PMID: 19129520). It is also deleted more rarely in other leukemias such as acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 26069293, 25331116, 24072100)",
    "The IKZF3 Q147H mutation resides in the second zinc finger domain of the protein. Expression of this mutation in a human cell line demonstrated increased IKZF3 expression and decreased IKZF3 ubiquitination in the presence of lenalidomide therapy compared to wildtype IKZF3 (PMID: 24292625)",
    ". In vitro studies in lymphoblast cell lines also demonstrated that the Q147H mutation is more resistant to lenalidomide therapy compared to wildtype IKZF3 (PMID: 24292625)",
    "IKZF3 (also Aiolos) is a transcription factor that functions as a member of the Ikaros protein family (PMID: 9560339). Ikaros family transcription factors are required for normal development of the lymphoid system (PMID: 9560339). IKZF1, IKZF2, and IKZF3 form homo- and heterodimers to increase their affinity to bind DNA and to activate hematopoietic-specific transcription (PMID: 9560339). Specifically, IKZF3 is more highly expressed in committed lymphoid progenitor cells and mediates differentiation into pre-T and pre-B cell precursors and subsequent maturation (PMID: 9155026, 9806640). In addition, IKZF3 interacts with histone modifying complexes, such as the NURD complexes, and mediates their activity during lymphocyte maturation (PMID: 10204490, 10357820). Anti-apoptosis genes, such as BCL-2 and BCL-XL, are regulated by IKZF3, leading to control of lymphocyte survival (PMID: 11714801, 10369681). Expression of IKZF3 is upregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL) (PMID: 19016725, 18184862) and missense hotspot mutations, predicted to stabilize the IKZF3 protein, have been identified in CLL (PMID: 28584254, 23415222). However, deletions in IKZF3 have been identified in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other hematopoietic malignancies, suggesting IKZF3 may function as both an oncogene and tumor suppressor (PMID: 17344859, 24212482, 24072100). Lenalidomide, a drug with efficacy in multiple myeloma and B cell malignancies, specifically targets IKZF3 and IKZF1 for proteasome-mediated degradation, which contributes to the cytotoxicity of the drug (PMID: 24292625, 24292623).",
    "IL-10 is a cytokine that inhibits the secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines by regulatory T cells, activated macrophages, and other immune cells (PMID: 11244051). IL-10 expression is tightly regulated by specific transcription factors based on immune cell type, which prevents excessive immune responses and autoimmune disease (PMID: 20154735). In macrophages and dendritic cells, IL-10 is involved in the regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and can block NF-κB activity (PMID: 14678266). IL-10 deficient mice develop inflammatory diseases with excessive immune responses after pathogen challenge (PMID: 24566625). Conversely, high IL-10 expression in mice has also been shown to promote an anti-tumor immune response (PMID: 18613832). IL-10 mutations have been identified in early-onset immune disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (PMID: 25373860). Higher IL-10 levels are associated with more aggressive disease and increased macrophage recruitment following chemotherapy in pre-clinical models of breast cancer (PMID: 25559954) and blockade of IL-10 receptors can improve chemotherapy responses in mice (PMID: 25446896).",

IL3 is highly expressed in activated T lymphocytes and is important in mediating the immune responses of mast cells, dendritic cells, and basophils (PMID: 23046136). The main receptor partner of IL3 is IL3R, a heterodimeric cell-surface receptor, which binds IL3 via the cytokine-specific α-subunit to recruit the shared βc subunit (PMID: 29374162). Initiation of IL3-IL3R signaling results in the activation of downstream effector pathways, including the JAK-STAT pathway which mediates STAT-dependent transcription of immune target genes (PMID: 18692472). IL3 signaling regulates various aspects of immune regulation including differentiation, inflammation, proliferation, and survival (PMID: 3087441, 18178860, 23535386). Increased IL3 expression in hematopoietic studies results in leukemic self-renewal and survival, suggesting that IL3 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 2439154, 10536003). Overexpression of IL3 has also been implicated in autoimmune diseases, resulting in hyper-responsiveness to IL3 stimulation (PMID: 18341658, 6430708, 28031576, 9446636, 26131743). Rearrangements involving IL3 are found in patients with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias, typically leading to increased IL3 expression and eosinophilic proliferation (PMID: 29424254, 3546615, 30207070).",
    "IL6ST encodes gp130, a membrane glycoprotein that serves as the signal transducer for IL-6 family cytokines (PMID: 2261637). IL-6 cytokines bind to IL-6R, which leads to gp130 homodimerization and formation of a hexameric receptor complex with IL-6/IL-6R (PMID: 2261637, 19915009). gp130 then activates the JAK/STAT pathway through the effector STAT3 to regulate diverse cellular processes, including immune responses, development and hematopoiesis (PMID: 10661409, 8632998, 15650055). gp130 also mediates proliferation and cell migration independent of STAT3 by activating YAP, Notch and ERK1/2 signaling pathways (PMID: 25731159, 17256754). The activity of gp130 is negatively regulated by the inhibitor SOCS3 (PMID: 12754506). In-frame deletions in the binding site of gp130 result in the constitutive activation of the signal transducer and subsequent upregulation of its targets, including STAT3, YAP and Notch (PMID: 19020503). Mice engineered to express mutant gp130 exhibit increased STAT3 activation and rapid gastric tumorigenesis compared to wildtype (PMID: 18431520, 14699500). IL6ST is altered, mostly by in-frame deletions and missense mutations in the IL-6/IL-6R binding site, in inflammatory hepatocellular tumors (PMID: 19020503, 24501689).",
    "The IL7R S185C mutation is located in the extracellular domain of the protein. This mutation is found in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemias.

    "IL7R is a component of the interleukin 7 (IL7) receptor that heterodimerizes with the common interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain. IL7R signals through the JAK-STAT pathway (PMID: 15067053). IL7 regulates T, B, and NK cell development (PMID: 17013389, 25729925, 23242416, 22267219, 21167753). In addition, IL7R signaling regulates VDJ and T-cell receptr (TCR) rearragements (PMID: 12594950, 9858510). IL7R mutations leading to loss of function result in severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID) (PMID: 9843216, 24759676). Activating mutations in IL7R result in an oncogene that signals independently of cytokine binding (PMID: 21892159). Activating IL7R mutations are most commonly found in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 25207766, 22237106, 21536738).",

ING1 inhibits cellular proliferation via the regulation of pathways involved with apoptosis, cellular senescence, DNA repair, cell migration and invasion (PMID: 34685579, 34493070, 11461112). ING1 modulates transcription through chromatin remodeling via physical association with both histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs); this function is linked to its anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects (PMID: 34493070, 12015309). While mutations in the ING1 gene are rare, reduced levels of ING1 protein have been found in breast and prostate cancers, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 24008732, 12015309, 24962136, 34685579).

INHA deletion in mouse models leads to gonadal stromal tumors (PMID: 1448148), and polymorphisms in INHA are associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors (PMID: 18413775), both of which are consistent with its role in the regulation of hormone secretion.",
    "INHBA (inhibin beta A) is a ligand that participates in the formation of activin and inhibin protein complexes that have opposing functions in the gonads and pituitary glands. INHBA can homo- or heterodimerize to regulate follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis (PMID: 27328872). INHBA interacts with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) transmembrane receptors and activates downstream TGF-β signaling (PMID: 25560921). Activin complexes have been associated with regulation of cell differentiation in the ovary, placenta, prostate, and testis (PMID: 9464268, 9207855).

    "Insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) is one of the mediators of Insulin receptor (INSR) signalling in cells (PMID: 1648180, 19029956). Upon activation of INSR, IRS2 is phosphorylated and activated leading to the activation of the AKT and MAPK pathway (PMID: 1648180, 11292874, 21597332, 24810113). Dysregulation or IRS2 leads to obesity and diabetes and IRS2 deficiency impairs brain growth (PMID: 15467829, 12904469). IRS1 has oncogenic functions in multiple tumor entities such as squamous cell carcinoma and high IRS1 expression is associated with adverse prognosis (PMID: 24810113, 17030631, 22337149). Nedd4-induced ubiquitination or IRS2 enhances IGF signalling and its mitotic activity (PMID: 25879670). IRS2 amplifications have been observed in colorectal cancer which result in increased susceptibility to anti-EGFR therapy (PMID: 26416732).",
    "ITPKB, a member of the inositol trisphosphate-kinase family encodes for an inositol phosphate kinase that functions in regulating inositol phosphate metabolism in cellular signaling through phosphorylation of inositol polyphosphates (PMID: 24401760, 22981169). ITPKB is one of three isoforms in the inositol triphosphate-kinase family that share the conserved C-terminal catalytic domain but differ in regulation mechanisms (PMID: 24401760). ITPKB regulates calcium homeostasis by inhibiting calcium transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria (PMID: 12747803, 33443159). Knockdown of ITPKB in various patient-derived xenograft models represses cisplatin-resistant tumor growth mediated through NOX4 and sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin, suggesting that ITPKB functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 31081803). Upregulation of ITPKB has been identified in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer and ovarian cancer (PMID: 31081803).",
    "Truncating mutations of JAK1 can produce several forms of C-terminally truncated JAK1 proteins. Experimental studies with human gynecologic cancer cell lines harboring JAK1 truncating mutations demonstrated that these cells are defective in IFN-γ-induced antigen processing. Where wildtype JAK1 restored the antigen presenting function of JAK1, it's possible that truncating JAK1 mutations may contribute to immune escape of malignant cells by inhibiting the tumor antigen presentation and JAK1-mediated interferon response of these cells (PMID: 24154688, 12576323, 29121062)",

    "The JAK1 gene encodes Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), a ubiquitously expressed member of the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases (PMID: 25057888, 9096349). JAK1 forms a complex with cytokine receptors to initiate cytokine-mediated signaling. Upon cytokine activation, JAK1 forms oligodimers which phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic region of the cytokine receptors, leading to recruitment and activation of downstream targets such as STAT1-6 (PMID: 25057888). The STAT proteins then translocate to the nucleus and act as transcription factors, mediating several cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation and antigen presentation (PMID: 23406773). Several activating mutations in JAK1 have been detected in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other hematological malignancies, and inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway have been suggested as a potential therapy in those cases (PMID: 23340138). However, truncating mutations leading to loss-of-function of JAK1 have been frequently reported in gynecologic tumors and other cancers with microsatellite instability (PMID: 24154688, 29121062). Loss of JAK1 function is suggested to mediate immune escape in these tumors through impaired tumor antigen presentation and abolished JAK1-mediated interferon response (PMID: 24154688, 12576323, 29121062).",

    "JAK2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates cytokine signaling and requires a cognate receptor to respond to extracellular cytokine signaling (PMID: 25057888, 1848670). Activated JAK2 signaling is necessary for the normal production of blood cells such as erythrocytes and thrombocytes (PMID: 9590173). Activation of JAK2 leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of downstream effectors, such as STAT3/5 and MAPK, enabling the translocation of these signaling molecules to the nucleus to activate transcription (PMID: 25057888). Gain-of-function mutations in JAK2 have been identified in patients with myeloproliferative disorders, including 95% of polycythemia vera and 50% of essential thrombocytopenia and myelofibrosis malignancies (PMID: 1583762, 23009934, 25629741), suggesting that JAK2 functions predominantly as an oncogene. JAK2 fusions and activating mutations have also been identified in various leukemias and lymphomas (PMID: 9360930, 18270328). The most commonly identified mutation is JAK2 V617F, an alteration that activates kinase activity by impairing the autoinhibitory domain of the kinase, leading to constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (PMID: 17721432). Murine models engineered to express the JAK2 V617F mutation develop a myeloproliferative disorder (PMID: 28640953). While JAK2 mutations are rare in solid tumors, activation of the JAK2/STAT pathway has been found to be oncogenic in many tumor types (PMID: 26151455). The JAK2 kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib has been FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with high-risk myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera (PMID: 20843246). However, resistance to JAK2 inhibition has been found to occur via the formation of drug-resistant JAK1/JAK2 heterodimers (PMID: 22820254). Additional JAK2 inhibitors are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical trials to improve drug efficacy and reduce off-target effects (PMID: 28673391).",

    "If the Oncogenic Mutations occur at JAK3, could lead ton Early T-Cell Precursor Lymphoblastic Leukemia",
    "JAK3 encodes for Janus Kinase 3, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. JAK3 activation results in activation of the STAT family of proteins (PMID: 8986719) and can also signal through the MAPK and AKT pathways (PMID: 22120524). JAK3 regulates response to cytokines, chemokines, and metabolism (PMID: 8022486, 24498424, 25493954, 26451047). JAK3 signaling plays a crucial role in T-cell development, including regulation of T-cell apoptosis (PMID: 11134353). Clinically JAK3 signaling can mediate autoimmune disease and graft rejection (PMID: 14593182, 26230873). JAK3 mutations are seen in acute leukemias (PMID: 22237106, 16843266), myeloid and lymphoid leukemia subtypes (PMID: 23832011, 24446122), and lymphomas (PMID: 24837469, 23689514). JAK3 mutations are also found in solid tumors but at lower incidence (PMID: 18559588, 26096009, 24821835, 21868263). Loss of function mutations in JAK3 can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (PMID: 10075926).",
    "JARID2 is recurrently deleted in acute myeloid leukemia. Mouse models of JARID2 deletion in bone marrow progenitor cells that already expressed the IDH2 R140Q mutation demonstrate that JARID2 loss is oncogenic as cells with JARID2 loss and IDH2 R140Q resulted in AML when transplanted into recepient mice while cells with IDH2 R140Q alone developed a myeloproliferative disorder that did not progress to AML (PMID: 30423295)",

    ". Loss of JARID2 has also been associated with leukemic transformation in patients with myeloid malignancies (PMID: 22190018)",
    "JARID2 is a transcription factor that mediates the recruitment of epigenetic complexes to chromatin. JARID2 associates with the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for transcriptional repression of target genes by catalyzing the placement of the repressive di- and tri-methyl Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) marks on chromatin (PMID: 20123894, 29932905, 29348366, 25620564). In addition, JARID2 binds other histone modifications in order to regulate crosstalk between PRC2 and PRC1 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1) (PMID: 27892467). PRC2 function is important in the repression of developmental regulators such as the HOX genes and X-inactivation (PMID: 16618801, 12649488). JARID2 activity is also essential in several contexts including skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue development (PMID: 29891551, 30119689). Increased JARID2 expression has been associated with proliferation, migration, and invasion in ovarian, hepatocellular, and bladder cancer cells, among others (PMID: 28765957, 28445934, 27259236, 22431509). Deletions and missense mutations are found in hematopoietic malignancies and non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 22190018, 23047306, 22053108, 30423295).",
    "In human liposarcomas (both well-differentiated and dedifferentiated), a proportion of tumors contain amplification of the MDM2 or CDK4 loci. However, dedifferentiated liposarcomas are always associated with amplification of either 6q23 or 1p32. Amplification of c-JUN at 1p32 results in its increased expression. In dedifferentiated human liposarcomas, differentiation of tumour cells into adipocytes was blocked by JUN expression by interference with CEBPb function (PMID: 17418412)",
    ". Amplification of JUN is associated with amplification of MDM2, one of the earliest oncogenic events in liposarcoma development, suggesting that amplification of JUN is essential during early tumorigenesis (PMID: 19449367)",
    "JUN (also c-Jun) is a transcription factor that dimerizes with the Activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex. The AP-1 complex regulates a plethora of cellular process including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis through transcriptional control of several downstream target genes, including p53, cyclin D1 and EGFR (PMID: 12791272, 10072388, 10790372). In its turn, c-Jun is regulated by phosphorylation, mediated in particular by the JNK, p38 and WNT signaling pathways for directing cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and migration processes (PMID: 10080190, 16007074, 20231272). AP-1 is a potent transforming factor in multiple experimental models, although anti-oncogenic effects have also been described in specific contexts (PMID: 11988758, 14668816). Although a direct oncogenic role for AP-1 has not been described in human tumors, mechanisms for a putative role have been explored in for example breast cancer cell lines and models of liposarcoma, a tumor type in which c-Jun amplification has been observed (PMID: 17637753, 17418412).",

    "KAT6A (also MYST3 or MOZ) is a histone acetyltransferase that is a member of MYST family of proteins (PMID: 16626284, 18754862, 17694081). KAT6A functions as a transcriptional coactivator that has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, with the ability to acetylate several histone residues (PMID: 11313971). In addition, KAT6A forms complexes with transcriptional regulators to coordinate gene expression, including the hematopoietic proteins AML1, PU.1, and RUNX, among others (PMID: 11742995, 16702405, 11965546, 12771199). The activity of KAT6A has been implicated in the formation of additional transcriptional complexes with ING proteins that regulate a variety of cellular processes including differentiation, DNA damage, chromatin state and cellular proliferation (PMID: 17694081). Loss of KAT6A expression in murine models results in defects in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartments, consistent with a role of KAT6A in hematopoietic gene regulation (PMID: 16651658, 12676584). Dominant germline mutations in KAT6A are found in individuals with intellectual disabilities (PMID: 25728777). Recurrent translocations involving KAT6A are found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 9447825, 8782817, 9558366).

The HBO1 complex mediates acetylation of histone H3K14ac, regulating various processes such as transcriptional activation and immune response (PMID: 24065767, 26620551). The multimeric complex also functions in acetylation of other histones, including H4K5ac, H4K8ac and H4K12ac, to regulate DNA replication initiation and inhibit NF-kB signaling (PMID: 16997280, 19187766, 20129055). Overexpression of KAT7 in cancer cell lines induces cell growth, migration and invasion, suggesting that KAT7 functions primarily as an oncogene (PMID: 35868058, 34039960, 19372580).

KBTBD4 has not yet been functionally characterized, however, it is a member of a family of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase adaptor proteins (PMID: 28726821). Adaptor molecules mediate the specificity of E3 ligase proteins, which ubiquitinate and target proteins for degradation via the proteasome (PMID: 23349464). In-frame insertions in KBTBD4, typically in the Kelch domain, have been found recurrently in patients with Group 3 or Group 4 subtypes of medulloblastoma (PMID: 28726821) and as the sole alteration in several pineal parenchymal tumors of intermediate differentiation (PPTID)(PMID: 30877433). These insertions are predicted by structural studies to occur in the substrate-binding interface of the protein (PMID: 28726821, 23349464). However, this recurrence may be limited to certain populations, as follow-up studies have demonstrated that KBTBD4 insertions were absent in a cohort of medulloblastomas from Brazilian centers (PMID: 31403685).

KDM5A's plant homeodomain (PHD) recognizes unmethylated H3K4 to locate the enzyme to specific chromatin regions (PMID: 25686748). Through chromatin modification and transcriptional silencing, KDM5A regulates cellular differentiation and cooperates with the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) in controlling cell cycle progression (PMID: 18722178, 15949438, 23093672, 23112189). It also affects cellular metabolism and circadian rhythms (PMID: 26314709, 21960634). In cancer KDM5A promotes tumor progression by targeting cell cycle and angiogenesis genes and enhancing treatment resistance (PMID: 23722541, 24716659, 26566863, 20371346). It is amplified in breast and head and neck cancers (PMID: 22937203, 24425785). It is translocated in leukemia with the NUP98 gene and alters HOX gene expression (PMID: 16419055, 19430464).",

KDM5C is ubiquitously expressed in almost all human tissues, including white blood cells, with the highest levels of expression found in the brain and skeletal muscle (PMID: 23356856). Loss of KDM5C exerts an essential role in mammalian DNA replication. Moreover, KDM5C silencing induces aberrant H3K4me3 levels at active origins, thus halting DNA replication and ultimately S phase progression (PMID: 25712104). Mutation of the KDM5C gene was first described as causing X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) in 2005 (PMID: 15586325), and has been linked to some forms of cancer (PMID: 21544224, 20181063, 20133580). The prevalence of KDM5C mutations in patients with XLID is estimated to be ~3% (PMID: 23356856), and somatic mutations in this gene have been identified in 4-9% of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (PMID: 20054297, 24166983, 22138691). Knockdown of KDM5C in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) -/- ccRCC cells significantly enhanced tumor growth in a xenograft model, suggesting that KDM5C functions as a tumor suppressor in this cancer model (PMID: 21725364, 25111482).

    "KDM5D, part of the KDM5 family, is located on the Y chromosome and encodes a male-specific histone demethylase that targets trimethylated H3K4 (PMID: 34127738, 30864186, 35805040, 26747897). KDM5D plays a role in transcriptional regulation, as the demethylation of H3K4 is suggested to repress gene transcription (PMID: 30864186, 26747897). KDM5D is associated with male organ rejection in female recipients due to a short peptide derived from the protein that is a minor histocompatibility antigen (PMID: 35805040). Down-regulation of KDM5D has been observed in various cancer types including lung, prostate, gastric, colorectal and renal cancer, and is in part due to deletions on the Y chromosome; this supports its role as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 34127738, 26747897). In both in vitro and in vivo models of prostate and gastric cancer, knock-down of KDM5D promoted cellular invasion and increased expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulators such as N-cadherin, slug and vimentin (PMID: 30864186, 26747897). Overexpression of KDM5D inhibited proliferation and increased apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells and reduced the growth rate of tumors in mice (PMID: 34688635). However, KDM5D was found up-regulated in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer in male patients and was associated with increased metastases, suggesting KDM5D may function as an oncogene in this tumor-specific context through the repression of genes involved in cell adhesion and immune recognition (PMID: 37344599).",

    "KDM6A (lysine-specific demethylase 6A) encodes a chromatin-modifying enzyme that mediates transcriptional co-activation by functioning as a di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase. KDM6A is part of the larger ASC-2 complex (ASCOM) that also contains lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C). KDM6A is located on Xp11.2, but it escapes X inactivation, resulting in bi-allelic expression in females (PMID: 9499428). Association of KDM6A with KMT2D and KMT2C couples H3K27 demethylation to H3K4 methylation (PMID: 17761849). Germline deletions and point mutations in KDM6A cause Kabuki syndrome, which is characterized by typical facial features, skeletal anomalies, dermatoglyphic abnormalities, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and postnatal short stature (PMID: 22197486, 22840376, 22901312, 23076834). Early sequencing efforts led to the discovery of inactivating KDM6A mutations in a number of human malignancies including multiple myeloma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 19330029). Later studies found KDM6A mutations in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (PMID: 21248752), medulloblastoma (PMID: 22722829, 22832583), adenoid cystic carcinoma (PMID: 23685749), urothelial bladder cancer (PMID: 24476821, 21822268, 25092538, 25225064), aristolochic acid-associated upper tract urothelial carcinoma (PMID: 23926199), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 25320243), and pancreatic cancer (PMID: 25719666). In prostate cancer, KDM6A mutations are seen in progression to lethal castration-resistant disease (PMID: 22722839). Loss of KDM6A may confer sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors (PMID: 28228601).",
    "Amplification of KDR corresponds to copy number changes in the gene that lead to higher protein expression. Increased expression of KDR promotes angiogenesis and tumor growth (PMID: 11114740)",
    ". In preclinical studies in non small cell lung cancer cell lines, amplification of KDR was associated with VEGF-induced activation of mTOR, p38, and tumor cell invasiveness (PMID: 26578684)",
    "KDR (kinase domain receptor), also known as VEGFR2 or Flk-1, is a tyrosine kinase receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and plays a key role in angiogenesis. In hypoxic conditions, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) protein stabilization leads to upregulation of KDR and VEGF (PMID: 23172303). Binding of VEGF to KDR results in stimulation of angiogenesis via receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, activation of phospholipase C (PLC-gamma) and downstream signaling via protein kinase C (PKC) and RAF/MEK/ERK (PMID: 10327068, 12778165). Mutations of KDR are rare in tumors, and alterations of KDR activity typically occur via KDR amplification and subsequent overexpression. Most therapies blocking KDR signaling target the angiogenesis pathway in general, such as bevacizumab, an antibody that targets VEGF-A (PMID: 15136787).",
    "KEAP1 deletions have been identified in patients with lung cancer and lead to loss of KEAP1 protein expression. Although functional studies have primarily been performed to characterize KEAP1 missense mutations, KEAP1 deletions are predicted to reduce the ability of KEAP1 to suppress NRF2 leading to upregulation of NRF2 target pathways. KEAP1 regulated NRF2 target pathways include those associated with antioxidants, oxidative stress and drug efflux pumps in cancer cells that have been associated with chemotherapy resistance (PMID: 17020408, 24142871)",
    ". In addition, the biliary tract cancer (BTC) cell line TGBC24TKB that harbors homozygous deletion of the KEAP1 gene is observed to be resistant to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and this resistance is associated with NRF2 activation (PMID: 18692501)",
    "KEAP1 encodes a substrate adaptor protein for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is formed by the proteins CUL3 and RBX1 and targets NRF2 for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (PMID: 15572695). NRF2 (encoded by the gene NFE2L2) is a master transcriptional regulator of the cellular antioxidant response (PMID: 24142871, 21251164). Activation of NRF2 can provide a fitness advantage for cells by upregulating pathways for handling xenobiotic stress and detoxification (PMID: 21251164). The BTB domain of KEAP1 binds CUL3, and the Kelch-repeat domain binds NRF2 via KEAP1 homodimerization (PMID: 21251164). The IVR region contains critical cysteine residues whose thiol side chains are modified in response to oxidative stress. Modification of cysteine residues in the IVR disrupts binding of KEAP1 to NRF2 and CUL3, resulting in the release of NRF2 for transcriptional activation of target genes (PMID: 12193649). Mutations in KEAP1 tend to occur throughout the body of the gene (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Apr. 2015), and are commonly thought to disrupt KEAP1-dependent regulation of NRF2. This disruption activates NRF2-dependent pathways, including those regulated in the oxidative stress response (PMID: 24142871).",
    "KIT gene amplifications occur in a subset of melanomas, gliomas and small cell lung carcinomas, among other tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, April 2017). KIT gene amplifications are apparently not correlated with KIT protein overexpression in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and medulloblastomas (PMID: 15869870, 19779861)",
    " . In contrast, KIT amplifications correlated with KIT protein overexpression in both ovarian dysgeminomas (PMID: 21523721)",

    "The proto-oncogene KIT encodes a type 3 transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. The receptor is activated through dimerization and autophosphorylation upon binding by its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF) also known as mast cell growth factor (MGF) (PMID: 9438854). KIT activation results in increased intracellular signaling through several pathways including PI3K, MAPK and STAT, ultimately leading to cell proliferation and survival (PMID: 17546049, 11896121, 22089421). For patients with wildtype gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST; no KIT or PDGFRA mutations), NCCN recommends testing for germline succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations. About 10-15% of GISTs are wildtype; thus, the absence of a mutation does not exclude the diagnosis of GIST. In patients without KIT mutations, a subset of those with advanced GISTs benefit from imatinib (0-45% of patients) (NCCN Soft Tissue Sarcoma v.2.2017). Activating KIT mutations occur in 80 - 90% of GISTs and are distributed over multiple exons with different frequencies (exons 11 (66.1%), exon 9 (13%), exon 13 (1.2%), and exon 17 (0.6%)) (PMID: 15365079, 17268243, 11719439). There are at least eight small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting KIT that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration with the efficacy of each TKI strongly depending on the location of the activating KIT mutation (PMID: 2427414, 18955458, 19164557).",
    "Truncating mutations in KLF2 occur throughout the protein as frameshift indels and nonsense mutations (PMID: 25428260, 25283840)",

    ". In addition, the expression of KLF2 truncating mutations failed to regulate the activity of NF-κB in response to a variety of stimulants that initiate TNF-receptor, TLR (toll-like receptor), canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways, suggesting a defect in binding of KLF2 to DNA (PMID: 25428260)",
    "If the Oncogenic Mutations occur at KLF2, could lead ton Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma",
    "KLF2 is a transcription factor that is a member of the Kruppel protein family (PMID: 25428260). KLF2 expression is important for maintenance of quiescence in a variety of cell types, including in non-cycling B-cells and naïve T-cells (PMID: 17681603, 18246069, 16455954, 16455954). Transcriptional activity of KLF2 mediates the suppression of gene expression programs required for B- and T-cell activation (PMID: 17681603, 18246069). In addition, KLF2 represses the transcriptional activity of NF-κB in response to stimulation from a variety of signaling pathway including Toll-like receptor (TLR) and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, among others (PMID: 25428260). Loss of KLF2 in murine models leads to expanded marginal zone B-cells, likely due to altered differentiation and homing of B cells (PMID: 20691614, 21187409). Somatic inactivating mutations in KLF2 are found in splenic marginal zone lymphoma (PMID: 25428260, 25283840), suggesting that KLF2 functions as a tumor suppressor. Loss-of-function variants in KLF2 result in unrestricted activation of NF-κB, leading to constitutive activation of various B-cell related signaling pathways (PMID: 25428260).",
    "KLF3 is a transcription factor that is a member of the Kruppel protein family (PMID: 21360637). KLF3 modulates epithelial homeostasis by controlling the activation of epidermal differentiation gene programs (PMID: 32659720). In addition, KLF3 functions as a transcriptional repressor in adipocyte, erythroid and chondrocyte differentiation (PMID: 32385917, 32523103, 30619490, 30324848, 29775748, 23918807). Binding of KLF3 to target genes is important for various cellular activities including differentiation, proliferation, fat accumulation, angiogenesis and inflammation (PMID: 31486564, 32213596, 27226561, 31196982). KLF3 cooperates with other transcriptional and chromatin regulators, such as CBP, CtBP2, and C/EBPα, to activate gene expression (PMID: 32659720, 30619490, 25659434, 10756197). KLF family member-mediated gene regulation is complex due to the competition for binding sites across the genome at enhancers and promoters (PMID: 28541545). In various cell types, altered KLF3 activity mediates gene expression via interactions with long non-coding RNAs and micro RNAs (PMID: 31462890). KLF3 expression is downregulated in several cancer types, including lung and colon cancer, and is indicative of poor patient prognosis (PMID: 32213596, 28423541, 21470678).

Overexpression of KLF4 with OCT3/4, SOX2, and c-MYC is able to induce pluripotent stem cells from adult tissues (PMID: 16904174). It is also involved in terminal differentiation of monocytes and the T-cell immune response (PMID: 18390749, 25992862). In certain cancers, KLF4 functions to regulate the differentiation of tumor cells and may have a potential tumor suppressor role (PMID: 25181544, 26113043, 26338995, 26880805, 21224073, 22284679, 26934576).

    "KLF5 (Kruppel-like factor 5) is a zinc-finger-containing transcription factor whose expression is highest in rapidly dividing cells, such as in the crypt epithelium of the intestinal tract or the basal layer of the dermis, and results in the induction of genes regulated by cyclin D1 (PMID: 15077182, 10767086). KLF5 binds to GC-rich regions of DNA and has antagonizing effects on gene expression compared to KLF4, another KLF family member involved in stemness and regulation of cellular differentiation (PMID: 16904174). KLF5 is important in regulating the integrity of intestinal stem cells and has been implicated as a stemness reprogramming factor (PMID: 24626089, 23112162). In tumor models, KLF5 mediates RAS-driven oncogenesis (PMID: 18054006, 15077182) and while amplification of KLF5 is implicated in gastric cancer, it is also thought to regulate breast cancer invasiveness (PMID: 26189798, 26419610).",
    "Truncating mutations of KLHL6 in the BTB domain result in loss of protein function. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that loss of function results in increased growth and survival in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PMID: 29695787)",
    "KLHL6 (kelch like family member 6) encodes a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac)-Kelch protein that is selectively expressed in lymphoid tissue and involved in B-cell antigen receptor signaling and germinal center B-cell maturation (PMID: 29695787, 16166635, 30646831). The protein functions as an E3 ligase through assembly with CULLIN3 to form a functional CULLIN-RING ubiquitin ligase (PMID: 29695787, 28807996, 30646831). Mutations in the KLHL6 gene may cause dissociation of CULLIN3 from KLHL6 resulting in loss of E3 ligase catalytic activity (PMID: 30646831, 29695787). KLHL6 gene mutations have been identified in patients with B-cell malignancies including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma (PMID: 29695787, 29044464, 21642962, 27959900). In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that loss of KLHL6 favors DLBCL growth and survival (PMID: 29695787, 30646831). However, KLHL6 has been found to be up-regulated in gastric cancer and is associated with a less favorable prognosis in this tumor type. Consistent with its role as an oncogene in gastric cancer, down-regulation of KLHL6 in human gastric carcinoma cells results in reduced colony formation, proliferation and viability, and suppressed tumor growth in mice (PMID: 29044464).",

    "KMT2A (also MLL1) is a histone methyltransferase that functions as an epigenetic modulator that methylates lysine residue 4 on the tail of histone H3 (H3K4). Methylation of H3K4 leads to increased genome accessibility, recruitment of transcriptional complexes, and activation of gene expression (PMID: 25998713). KMT2A is crucial for embryogenesis and normal hematopoiesis by stimulating expression of several important developmental genes including the homeobox (Hox) genes (PMID: 24213472). Chromosomal translocations involving KMT2A that result in gain-of-function fusion proteins have been identified in pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and are overrepresented in therapy-related AML. Though KMT2A has a diverse group of fusion partners in leukemia, the most common KMT2A recombination partners include AF4, AF9, and ENL, which are proteins that interact with transcriptional elongation machinery (PMID: 28701730). KMT2A fusion proteins disrupt the normal activity of hematopoietic stem cells and the normal chromatin state, leading to activation of oncogenic signaling pathways (PMID: 16862118). In addition, loss-of-function mutations in KMT2A have been identified in solid tumors including bladder, stomach and endometrial cancers (PMID: 21822268, 23636398).

    "KRAS is a member of the RAS family of small GTPases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Under physiologic conditions, these RAS proteins cycle between an active (GTP-bound) and an inactive (GDP-bound) state, to activate the MAPK and PI3K oncogenic pathway signaling downstream of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) (PMID: 22189424). The function of RAS enzymes is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as SOS, which enable the exchange of GDP to GTP, as well as by GTPase activating proteins, such as NF1, which increase the ability of RAS to hydrolyze GTP. Once activated, RAS mediates the regulation of cellular proliferation and other cellular functions through the activation of distinct intracellular signaling pathways, including the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Transforming mutations in KRAS are frequently found in pancreatic, colon, endometrial, ovarian and biliary cancers; almost all of these mutations result in constitutive activation of KRAS, thereby promoting cell proliferation (PMID: 21993244, 24651010). KRAS mutations occur primarily in three major hotspots, G12, G13 and Q61, the first two of which occur in the GTP-ase domain and the latter interferes with the ability of NF1 to bind and regulate KRAS (PMID: 22589270, 21993244, 24651010). Other less well-characterized mutations such as A146T/V/P and L19F have also been characterized and found to be activating albeit at lower frequencies (PMID: 20147967, 20432530, 20570890). Germline KRAS mutations are responsible for both Noonan syndrome (NS) and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome (PMID: 16474405, 16474404, 19467855, 17056636) that are associated with hyperactivated MAPK pathway, distinctive clinical characteristics and a predisposition to cancer (PMID: 19467855, 17704260).",
    "KSR2 is a scaffolding protein that is a member of the kinase suppressor Ras (KSR) family (PMID: 19560418). The KSR protein family has been implicated in the activation of MAPK signaling cascades via direct protein interactions and substrate localization (PMID: 19560418, 26891695). Proteomic analyses show that KSR2 interacts with several components of the MAPK signaling pathway including BRAF, MEK and ERK, as well as other proteins involved in cellular localization, including C-TAK1, 14-3-3 and PP2A1 (PMID: 19560418, 21441910). KSR2 specifically bridges the signaling molecules RAF and MEK to mediate RAF-mediated MEK phosphorylation (PMID: 11850406, 19560418, 29433126). In addition, KSR2 interacts with the phosphatase calcineurin to regulate calcium-mediated MAPK signaling (PMID: 19560418). KSR2 activity is also important for AMPK signaling and for glucose update and fatty acid oxidation (PMID: 19883615). KSR2 plays a role in negative feedback of the MAPK pathway, possibly by allosterically binding RAF (PMID: 19560418, 29433126). KSR2 is an important regulator of body fat as determined in a murine screen (PMID: 18719666). Loss of KSR2 in mice results in increased adiposity, reduced energy expenditure and insulin resistance, a phenotype consistent with human obesity (PMID: 19883615, 21127480). Germline mutations in KSR2 are associated with obesity and linked to hyperphagia, insulin resistance and impaired fatty oxidation in individuals (PMID: 24209692, 29273807). Somatic mutations in KSR2 are rare in human cancers; however, overexpression of KSR2 has been found in several cancer types including breast cancer (PMID: 21403620). Overexpression of KSR2 in preclinical studies is also associated with increased anchorage-independent growth and proliferation (PMID: 22801368). Small molecule inhibitors of KSR have shown preclinical efficacy and synergy with MEK inhibition, likely due to inhibition of negative feedback signaling (PMID: 27556948, 28333549).",
    "LARP4B is an RNA binding protein that is a member of the LARP family (PMID: 26501340). LARP4B binds to messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) components, such as RACK1 and poly(A) binding protein (PABP), at 3’ poly(A) regions of mRNA (PMID: 12388589, 32517187, 26644407). These LARP4B-containing mRNP complexes mediate translation by serving as a bridge between protein regulators and ribosomes (PMID: 20573744). Because LARP4B has varied roles in mRNA stability and protein translation, LARP4B is important in many cellular processes including proliferation and growth control (PMID: 26001795, 32517187, 29462618). Somatic mutations in LARP4B are found in hypermutated stomach adenocarcinomas and are predicted to promote nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in loss of protein expression (PMID: 28649990). Additional studies have demonstrated that LARP4B may function as a tumor suppressor in glioma and prostate cancer (PMID: 26933087, 25534202, 31173237). However, LARP4B also has cancer-promoting roles in acute myeloid leukemia and liver cancer, suggesting that LARP4B has context-specific roles in cancer progression (PMID: 31772683, 31173237).",
    "LATS1 deletion results in loss of the tumor suppressor LATS1 expression. Deletion of LATS1 in mice led to hyperplastic changes in the pituitary and the development of ovarian tumors (PMID: 9988269)",
    " which was associated with down-regulation of members of the Hippo-signaling pathway including WWTR1, STK4, STK3, LATS2 and YAP1 (PMID: 26040669, 23573293)",
    "LATS1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a regulator of the Hippo signal transduction pathway (PMID: 20935475, 27300434), which is involved in several processes of cancer progression and physiologically has important regulatory functions in organ development and regeneration (PMID: 23467301, 24825474, 24336504). Phosphorylation of LATS1 and co-activator MOB1 by upstream kinases MST1/2 results in LATS1 activation. Under physiologic conditions, activated LATS1 phosphorylates the transcriptional co-activators YAP1 and TAZ (PMID: 19878874). Through such regulation, LATS1 controls the nuclear localization of YAP1/TAZ, thereby regulating expression of genes involved in various cellular functions including proliferation and apoptosis (PMID: 20951342, 18158288). LATS1 is thought to function as a tumor suppressor via the negative regulation of cellular survival pathways mediated by YAP1/TAZ (PMID: 18158288). Somatic loss-of-function alterations in the LATS1 gene are found in several human cancers including malignant mesothelioma (PMID: 25902174, 26928227). In addition, the promoter region of the LATS1 gene is frequently hypermethylated in multiple types of human cancers (PMID: 15746036, 17049657, 23885148).",
    "LATS2 deletion has been found in malignant mesothelioma (PMID: 21245096)",
    ". In cell lines, LATS2 homozygous deletion corresponds to loss of LATS2 protein expression, and rescue with wildtype LATS2 protein in these cells results in decreased proliferation and anchorage-independent growth compared to rescue with truncated LATS2 protein (PMID: 21245096)",

LATS2 mutations have been identified to co-occur with NF2 alterations, leading to Hippo pathway dysregulation (PMID: 28003305).",
    "LCK is a tyrosine kinase that is a member of the SRC family of kinases and is important in the regulation of immune signaling pathways (PMID: 20541955). LCK is expressed predominantly on T-cells and mediates pre-T-cell receptor (TCR) and TCR signaling (PMID: 27469439). TCR signaling requires phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the TCR after peptide-MHC molecule binding (PMID: 20541955). LCK stably binds the cytoplasmic tails of T-cell co-receptors, such as CD4 and CD8, and is recruited to the ITAMs on the TCR/CD3 co-receptor complex to facilitate ITAM phosphorylation (PMID: 2455897, 2470098). Phosphorylation of the TCR complex results in the recruitment of ZAP70, a protein kinase, which initiates LAT phosphorylation, where LAT serves as a docking site for downstream signaling cascades (PMID: 29915297). LCK can also interact with a variety of signaling molecules to mediate signaling axes including CD55, CD44 and NOTCH1, among others (PMID: 28838952, 9573028, 14583609). Overexpression of LCK in mice results in thymic tumors, suggesting that LCK can function as an oncogene (PMID: 1708890). Aberrant activation of LCK has been identified in several tumor types and rearrangements of LCK are found in lymphoid tumors (PMID: 3463975, 18316591). In addition, LCK activity has been associated with cancer stemness and metastasis in solid tumors (PMID: 30353164). Small molecule kinase inhibitors that target LCK, such as saracatinib, are currently under preclinical investigation (PMID: 28838952).",
    "Amplification of LEF1 typically results in overexpression of the protein. LEF1 amplification has been identified in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 25942645, 26950276, 22184516)",

    "LEF1, a member of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor family, encodes for a transcription factor expressed in pre-B and T cells (PMID: 10933391). LEF1 binds to the T-cell receptor-alpha enhancer to drive T-cell antigen receptor-alpha chain expression (PMID: 7958926, 2010090). LEF1 functions as a nuclear effector in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to regulate cellular proliferation and cellular apoptosis (PMID: 8757136, 18316418). Overexpression of LEF1 in various cancer cell lines and models induces tumorigenesis, cellular proliferation, migration and resistance to chemotherapy, suggesting that LEF1 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 31296250, 18316418, 34639214). Amplification of LEF1 has been identified in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 25942645, 26950276, 22184516).",
    "LGR5 amplification is an alteration frequently reported in various cancer types, including basal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, colorectal tumors and ovarian tumors (PMID: 16575208, 18688030)",
    ". In vitro and in vivo studies overexpressing LGR5 in SiHa and HeLa cells and in nude mice demonstrated LGR5 is activating as measured by increased cell proliferation and tumor growth (​​PMID: 25193857). Treatment with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling inhibitor tegavivint in patients overexpressing LGR5 with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including lymphomas and desmoid tumors, is currently being evaluated in a phase I/II clinical trial (NCT04851119)",
    "LGR5, also known as GPR5, is a G-protein coupled receptor that regulates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway through binding to R-spondin (PMID: 21693646, 26086949). LGR5 is a marker for adult stem cells in various organs and tissues, stimulating stem cell proliferation and self-renewal through Wnt signaling (PMID: 22969042). Rearrangement of LGR5 has been identified in glioblastoma multiforme (PMID: 25500544). Amplified LGR5 mutations have been identified in various cancer types including basal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, colorectal tumors and ovarian tumors (PMID: 16575208, 18688030). Aberrant expression of LGR5 in breast cancer cells promotes tumorigenesis through long-term potentiation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway, leading to cancer cell mobility and tumor formation (PMID: 26086949). Conversely, LGR5 has been identified as a negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the context of B cells, demonstrated by upregulated nuclear beta-catenin and tumor growth suppression following ablation of LGR5 in B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Abstract: Cosgun et al. Abstract# 4515, AACR 2018.). Loss of LGR5 mutations have been identified in colorectal tumors (PMID: 23349017). Methylation of LGR5 promotes tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer cell lines and primary tumors as measured by decreased Wnt signaling, increased risk of metastasis and tumor recurrence (PMID: 22056143). LGR5 promotes tumor suppressive activity through Wnt signaling and loss of this function through alteration promotes tumorigenicity as measured by increased invasion, anchorage-independent growth and enhanced tumorigenicity in xenograft models (PMID: 22056143, 23349017).",
    "LMO1 (Lim-domain-only 1, also known as TTG1 and Rhombotin 1) is a Lim-domain-only protein that functions to regulate the formation of transcriptional complexes (PMID: 23303138). The Lim-domain-only proteins (LMO1-4) are characterized by two tandemly arrayed protein interacting LIM domains. The LIM domain is similar to a zinc finger domain; however, instead of mediating DNA-interactions it mediates protein-protein interactions (PMID: 10704826). LMO1 was first described to have oncogenic functions in T-lymphoblastic leukemia. It is was found to be located near chromosome 11 translocation breakpoints leading to overexpression in these leukemias (PMID: 2034676, 2115645). LMO1 expression can drive leukemogenesis and form protein complexes with TAL1 and other proteins. LMO1 protein complexes regulate transcription of known oncogenes such as MYB, one mechanism through which LMO1 leads to leukemogenesis (PMID: 22897851, 1508213). LMO1 is also described as an oncogene in neuroblastoma. A subset of neuroblastoma is robustly associated with germline sequence variants close to the LMO1 gene (PMID: 21124317). These sequence variants lead to high LMO1 expression through differential GATA transcription factor binding (PMID: 26560027). It is clear that LMO1 is associated with poor survival and a higher risk of metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of action are not well understood (PMID: 23303138).",
    "Recurrent translocations involving LMO2 are found in patients with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) (PMID: 16873670, 26108219)",
    ". Most commonly, LMO2 fuses downstream of strong promoter and enhancers of T-cell receptor genes, resulting in activation of LMO2 expression (PMID: 26108219)",
    ". Resultant LMO2 fusion proteins maintain most of the LMO2 protein, but result in the activation of a proximal LMO2 promoter (PMID: 25682596)",
    "If the Fusions occur at LMO2, could lead ton T-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma",
    "LMO2 is a transcription factor that is a member of the LIM-domain only protein family (PMID: 26108219, 20861166). LMO2 is expressed in hematopoietic cells and across many tissues during development; however, LMO2 is silenced in mature lymphoid lineages (PMID: 11248806). LMO2 regulates both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis as well as angiogenesis and maintenance of stemness (PMID: 8033210, 21343360). LMO2 functions as a member of a transcriptional complex containing TAL1, GATA1/2, RUNX1, MYB, and E-proteins, but LMO2 itself does not have any intrinsic DNA binding ability, acting predominantly to mediate protein-protein interactions (PMID: 25466247, 9214632). LMO2 is dependent on the binding of other proteins for stability, and these interactions are context-dependent (PMID: 26598604). LMO2 predominantly functions as a bridging protein to coordinate the binding of transcriptional complexes across GATA and E-box motifs and serves as an LDB1 docking site to activate enhancers at erythroid genes (PMID: 28636938). Increased expression of LMO2 in murine models results in a differentiation block, resulting in an accumulation of immature thymocyte progenitors (PMID: 8605871, 7579400). In combination with TAL1 activation or NOTCH1 mutations, LMO2 expression in thymocytes results in enhanced tumor-initiating properties (PMID: 8605871, 21670468). LMO2 also functions as the driver oncogene in X chromosome-linked severe combined immuno-deficiency syndrome therapy associated leukemias (PMID: 14985489). LMO2 overexpression is common in patients with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), due to recurrent deletions or translocations that fall upstream of LMO2, resulting in activation (PMID: 20861166, 26998100, 16873670, 25682596), suggesting that LMO2 functions predominantly as an oncogene.",

    ". LRP1B truncation mutations are suggested to be sensitive to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors as measured by the increased objective response rate and progression-free survival in patients harboring pathogenic LRP1B deletion, truncation, frameshift and missense mutations in a retrospective pan-cancer analysis (PMID: 33653800)",
    "LRP1B, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, functions in various cellular functions such as signal transduction, DNA damage response, synaptic transmission and cell migration (PMID: 19071120, 15082773). LRP1B interacts with cytosolic adapter and scaffold protein binding partners through canonical receptor-mediated endocytosis or its intracellular domain (PMID: 19071120). The LRP1B intracellular domain is soluble and is released from the extracellular domain through regulated intramembrane proteolysis cleavage (PMID: 17227771). The cleaved LRP1B intracellular domain localizes to the nucleus via nuclear localization signaling and mediates transcriptional activity through interactions with various binding partners (PMID: 17227771). LRP1B-deficient cancer cells demonstrate anchorage-independent growth and the inability to suppress colony formation, suggesting that LRP1B functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 17227771, 20095042, 27499094). Loss of LRP1B has been identified in various different cancers, including prostate cancer, ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma (PMID: 31270961, 27939411, 30719154). Epigenetic silencing of LRP1B, for example hypermethylation and histone deacetylation, has also been identified in different cancers, which include thyroid cancer and renal cell cancer (PMID: 27499094, 23521319). Loss of LRP1B is suggested to contribute to resistance to liposomal therapies such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, due to dysfunction in endocytic activity affecting drug uptake (PMID: 22896685).",
    "Truncating mutations of LRP5 typically occur at the multiple tandem repeat regions of the protein and result in dysregulation of the protein signaling pathways. These mutations have been identified in breast cancer (PMID: 19158955)",
    ". In vivo studies with a mouse xenograft model expressing truncated LRP5 variants demonstrate that truncating mutations are inactivating as measured by loss of β-catenin signaling regulation and increased tumor growth compared to wildtype (PMID: 19158955)",
    "LRP5 is a transmembrane receptor that is a member of the LDL-related protein family (PMID: 28979801, 17143291). LRP5 interacts with the co-receptors LRP6 and Frizzled family members at the plasma membrane following WNT ligand binding, leading to initiation of WNT-mediated downstream signaling (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). WNT signaling is a critical developmental pathway with roles in determining cell fate, tissue identity and polarity (PMID: 28218291). LRP5/6 binding by WNT ligands results in phosphorylation of CK1α and GSK3β, which recruit the signaling molecule DVL to the plasma membrane for polymerization and activation (PMID: 23258168, 19619488). DVL inactivates the β-catenin destruction complex (containing APC, GSK3β and AXIN) due to recruitment of AXIN to the co-receptor complex, allowing β-catenin to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus (PMID: 23258168). In the nucleus, β-catenin associates with the transcription factors LEF and TCF, displacing the repressive TLE proteins and forming transcription factor complexes that promote the expression of β-catenin target genes (PMID: 23258168, 19619488). LRP5 can also interact with antagonists of WNT, like the Dickkopf (DKK) proteins or SOST, to inhibit WNT activation (PMID: 17052975). Germline mutations in LRP5 have been identified in several malignancies including familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), which causes progressive vision loss, and diseases related to altered bone mass (PMID: 15024691, 20340138, 28341377). LRP5 mutations have been identified in various cancer types, though the functional role of these alterations has not yet been carefully elucidated (PMID: 31575382, 19158955, 18044981, 16266997, 19619488). However, mutations in LRP5 are predicted to result in deregulation of WNT signaling.",

    ". Expression of this mutation in HUVEC cells demonstrated that it is likely inactivating as measured by decreased cell surface expression, decreased WNT signaling and reduced cellular proliferation and invasion compared to wildtype (PMID: 24427284)",
    "LRP6 is a transmembrane receptor that is a member of the LDL-related protein family (PMID: 27617575, 17143291).

LRP5/6 also have roles in the regulation of tissue homeostasis and intestinal epithelial development (PMID: 31412666). Germline mutations in LRP6 are associated with several malignancies including tooth agenesis, bone mass disorders, early coronary disease and neural tube defects (PMID: 26387593, 26963285, 31085352, 24203697, 17332414). LRP6 mutations have been identified in various cancer types; however, the functional role of these alterations have not yet been carefully elucidated (PMID: 25500543, 15064719). However, overexpression of LRP6 is found in a variety of cancer types, including liver, breast and colorectal cancer, suggesting that LRP6 predominantly functions as an oncogene (PMID: 31412666, 20194742).",
    "LTB (also TNF-C) is a lymphotoxin or cytokine that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of ligands (PMID: 8621492). LTB forms a heterotrimeric complex with another TNF family member, LTα (one subunit of LTα; two subunits of LTB), which is termed the lymphotoxin protein complex (PMID: 8621492, 27323847). The lymphotoxin protein complex is found on the surface of activated T-, B- and natural killer cells (PMID: 27323847) and serves as the primary ligand for the lymphotoxin beta receptor, which is found on nonlymphoid cells (PMID: 27323847, 8621492). LTB activity is important for follicular dendritic cell development in germinal centers and is an important chemoattractant relevant for B-cell homing to follicles in the lymph node and spleen (PMID: 10917533, 10049949). Lymphotoxin signaling is necessary for normal lymphoid tissue organogenesis and maintenance (PMID: 9256477) and for regulation of stromal cell expression of chemokines in tissues such as the spleen (PMID: 9892622). LTB induces the expression of cytokines and chemokines that promote a positive feedback loop to recruit immune cells (PMID: 10917533, 27323847). Loss of LTB expression in mice results in reduced follicular dendritic cell development, impaired B-cell memory and abnormal lymphoid tissue development (PMID: 9256477). In addition, LTB is a regulator of NF-KB-mediated inflammatory signaling (PMID: 8798772, 28196873). Inflammatory gene expression signatures in autoimmune patients have been linked to lymphotoxin signaling, such as in rheumatoid arthritis (PMID: 25405351). Somatic mutations in LTB are found in patients with multiple myeloma and are predicted to be loss-of-function (PMID: 24429703, 28550183, 26282654). In addition, LTB overexpression has been linked to cancers that are driven by inflammation, such as hepatocellular carcinomas (PMID: 19800575).",

    "LTK (leukocyte tyrosine kinase) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is activated by the FAM10A/B proteins (PMID: 31227593, 25331893, 26630010). LTK is a member of the insulin receptor family and is closely related to ALK, with 79% sequence similarity among the tyrosine kinase domains and sensitivity to ALK inhibitors (PMID: 9223670, 31227593, 22347506, 25331893). LTK is normally expressed in pre-B lymphocytes and neuronal tissues (PMID: 9223670, 31227593). When bound to its ligands, LTK phosphorylates Shc and IRS-1 to activate downstream Ras signaling, thus promoting cell growth and inhibiting apoptosis (PMID: 8910363). Activated LTK also transmits anti-apoptotic signals through the PI3-kinase pathway by phosphorylating c-Cbl (PMID: 9223670). Kinase domain mutations in LTK lead to constitutive phosphorylation of the receptor and activation of downstream signaling targets including Shc, ERK, JAK1 and JAK2 (PMID: 22347506). LTK kinase domain mutants also transform epithelial cells and induce neural outgrowth in vitro (PMID: 22347506). LTK is involved in regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein export, such that knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of LTK leads to significantly fewer ER exit sites compared to wildtype/untreated cells (PMID: 31227593). While LTK is overexpressed among acute myeloid leukemia samples, alteration of LTK in human cancers is not well-characterized (PMID: 14977821).",
    "The LYN gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of the Src family (PMID: 9202419). LYN is involved in immune responses, B-cell signaling, signal transduction of growth factors and response to DNA damage, among other functions (PMID: 19290919, 10574931, 11825908, 11435302). LYN is a mediator that can positively or negatively regulate different processes depending on the cellular and physiological context (PMID: 15664155). LYN has been described to promote tumor growth, invasion, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and ERK signaling in different cancer contexts (PMID: 20215510, 22490227, 22731636). The LYN gene is typically altered by amplification in various tumors, including prostate, breast and ovarian cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016). LYN can be pharmacologically targeted with Src-kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib (PMID: 20215510, 22490227, 18056483).",

    "LZTR1 is a ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein that is a member of the BTB/POZ family (PMID: 30442762). LZTR1 functions as a scaffolding component of the CUL3 E3-ligase complex that targets substrate proteins to the proteasome for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (PMID: 23917401, 30442762). The oncogene RAS is ubiquitinated by the LZTR1-CUL3 complex which is essential for the normal protein turnover of RAS (PMID: 30442762). In addition, LZTR1 also binds RAF1, a signaling molecule in the MAPK pathway (PMID: 30368668). Loss of LZTR1 expression in hematopoietic cell lines results in enhanced MAPK signaling, reduced RAS ubiquitination, and increased association of RAS at the plasma membrane (PMID: 30442762). Germline mutations in LZTR1 have been identified in patients with Noonan syndrome and schwannomatosis (PMID: 24362817, 25335493, 25795793, 30481304). Somatic loss-of-function variants in LZTR1 are also found in patients with glioblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas (PMID: 28622513), leading to activation of MAPK signaling due to RAS stabilization (PMID: 30442762). Reduced LZTR1 expression in preclinical studies results in resistance to several tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, ponatinib, and rebastinib, due to constitutively active RAS signaling (PMID: 30442762).",
    "MAD2L2 (also MAD2B and REV7) is a DNA repair protein that functions as an adaptor protein in several DNA repair-associated complexes (PMID: 25896508, 30154076). MAD2L2 is the non-catalytic subunit of polymerase zeta, which functions as an error-prone DNA polymerase that bypasses DNA lesions during replication (PMID: 19258535, 31410467). The H2AX-53BP1 checkpoint complex recruits MAD2L2 to double strand breaks leading to blockage of homologous recombination (HR) (PMID: 25799992). MAD2L2 then promotes non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), including at unprotected telomeres, by inhibiting 5’ end resection downstream of 53BP1 and RIF1 (PMID: 25799990, 30046110, 30022168). MAD2L2-mediated NHEJ is important for specific cellular functions such as immunoglobulin class switch recombination (PMID: 25799992). MAD2L2 is also a member of the mitotic assembly checkpoint that prevents activation of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) during metaphase (PMID: 25896508). Overexpression of MAD2L2 has been found in several cancer types likely contributing to genomic instability (PMID: 17044027). In addition, MAD2L2-dependent translesion synthesis is predicted to contribute to error-prone repair after chemotherapy and, therefore, small molecule inhibitors targeting polymerase zeta are under development (PMID: 31178121). Loss of MAD2L2 activity has been implicated as a mechanism of PARP inhibitor resistance in BRCA1-deficient patients, due to a switch to HR repair; however, HR restoration may render these cancers radiosensitive (PMID: 25799992, 29789392).",

    "MAF is a transcription factor that is a member of the AP1 protein family (PMID: 19143053). MAF, along with MAFA and MAFB, are categorized as large MAF proteins that regulate gene expression via transactivation domains (PMID: 19143053). MAF coordinates DNA binding as a homodimer, or a heterodimer in complex with other MAF family members (PMID: 19143053), and recruits co-activators (such as EP300, CREBBP, KAT2B, and TBP) to initiate transcription (PMID: 11943779, 18042454, 15328344). MAF activity regulates a variety of cellular processes including migration, cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation, and cell-cell interactions, among others (PMID: 19143053, 16247450, 14998494). In addition, tightly regulated MAF expression is important for context-specific control of transcriptional programs during development and terminal differentiation (PMID: 17569705). The activity of large MAF proteins is also mediated by competition with small MAF proteins for the same binding site (PMID: 8552399). Loss of MAF in murine models results in altered cytokine expression with implications for immune regulation while increased expression of MAF leads to transformation (PMID: 10403649, 16424013, 16247450). Germline mutations in MAF are found in lens development disorders such as pulverulent cataracts (PMID: 12642301).

    "MAL2 truncation mutations typically occur in the MARVEL domain of the protein and produce N-terminally truncated MAL2 proteins. In vitro studies with yeast two-hybrid screening assays with N-terminal truncated MAL2 transcripts demonstrate that the mutation is inactivating as measured by loss of D52-like protein interaction compared to wildtype (PMID: 19175940)",
    "MAL2, a member of the MAL proteolipid family, is an essential transmembrane protein for the basolateral-to-apical transcytotic pathway (PMID: 11549320, 14576188). MAL2 traffics vesicles from the subapical compartment to fuse with basal cargo-containing endosomes and then subsequently traffics basal cargo vesicles back to the apical surface (PMID: 12370246, 16445687, 20493814). The transcytotic function of MAL2 is regulated by binding partners INF2 and CDC42 (PMID: 20493814). Overexpression of MAL2 in human colorectal cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting that MAL2 functions primarily as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 35847380). Despite functioning as a tumor suppressor gene, upregulation of MAL2 has been identified in various epithelial-derived cancers such as breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (PMID: 28562687, 32990678, 19287191). This is suggested to be due to the amplification of chromosomal region 8q24.12 enhancing expression of both MAL2 and known oncogene MYC (PMID: 32059473). The enhanced MAL2 expression is predicted to be associated with earlier stages of cancer progression and eventually, its expression is repressed during metastases as MYC expression increases (PMID: 32059473).",

    "MALT1 is a mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1, a cysteine paracaspase. MALT1 cleaves multiple substrates including BCL10, RELB, and TNFAIP3, and promotes NFkB signaling (PMID: 21873235, 18223652, 18264101). It associates with CARMA1 and BCL10 to form a complex (CBM) with scaffold function to recruit proteins important for signaling (PMID: 24074955, 15125833). MALT1 activity is employed in B-cell and T-cell antigen receptor activation and IL2 production (PMID: 23706741, 14614861, 14576442). Germline mutation can lead to immunodeficiency (PMID: 25627829, 23727036). MALT1 is translocated with partner API2 (BIRC3) in Mucosal-associated B-cell lymphomas (PMID: 10339464).

    "MAP2K1 (also known as MEK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as an effector protein in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade (PMID: 25435214, 17496922). The MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion and transcription (PMID: 25435214, 17496922). As a component of a three-tiered MAPK cascade, MEK1 activity is dependent on phosphorylation by upstream RAF kinases. Activated MEK1 in turn phosphorylates ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases1/2) which then serves as a transcriptional regulator (PMID: 22177953). These signaling events are triggered by growth factors, cytokines, and hormones that activate upstream receptor tyrosine kinases, ultimately leading to altered expression of key regulators of cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and survival (PMID: 9069255, 11242034). Dysregulation of MEK1 signaling is commonly associated with genetic alterations in RAS and RAF (PMID: 12068308, 12509763). Hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway is frequently observed in human cancers, such as melanoma, colorectal and lung cancers; however, oncogenic mutations in MEK1 in primary tumors are infrequent (PMID: 22753777, 25351745). The MEK1/2 inhibitors trametinib and cobimetinib are FDA-approved for the treatment of melanoma in combination with RAF inhibition and preclinical and clinical efforts are ongoing to determine the efficacy of MEK1 inhibition for other indications (PMID: 25435214). Some MEK1 mutations may confer resistance to both MEK and RAF inhibitors and can arise as a resistance mechanism to RAF inhibition (PMID: 19915144, 21383288).",
    "The MEK2 V35M mutation is found in patients with melanoma resistant to RAF inhibition (PMID: 21383288)",
    ". Expression of this mutation in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cells demonstrated that it is activating, as shown by increased pathway activation compared to wildtype MEK2. In vitro studies of cells expressing MEK2 V35M suggest that this mutation is resistant to the RAF/MEK inhibitors dabrafenib and trametinib but sensitive to the ERK inhibitor VRT11E as measured by protein activity and cell proliferation following drug treatment (PMID: 24265153)",

    "MAP2K2 (also known as MEK2) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as an effector protein in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade (PMID: 25435214, 17496922). The MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion and transcription (PMID: 25435214, 17496922). As a component of a three-tiered MAPK cascade, MEK2 activity is dependent on phosphorylation by upstream RAF kinases. Activated MEK2 in turn phosphorylates ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases1/2) which then serves as a transcriptional regulator (PMID: 22177953). These signaling events are triggered by growth factors, cytokines, and hormones that activate upstream receptor tyrosine kinases, ultimately leading to altered expression of key regulators of cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and survival (PMID: 9069255, 11242034). Germline missense mutations and deletions in MEK2 are found in patients with cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (PMID: 20358587, 18456719, 21178588, 24311457, 23379592). Hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway is frequently observed in human cancers; however, oncogenic mutations in MAP2K2 in primary tumors are infrequent (PMID: 24840079). Because of its major role in signaling as a RAF oncogene effector, several inhibitors of wildtype MEK2 and its close structural and functional homolog, MEK1, have been developed (PMID: 20149254, 24840079). The MEK1/2 inhibitors trametinib and cobimetinib are FDA-approved for the treatment of melanoma in combination with RAF inhibition and preclinical and clinical efforts are ongoing to determine the efficacy of MEK1/2 inhibition for other indications (PMID: 25435214). Mutations in MEK2 have been identified in melanomas insensitive to RAF and MEK inhibition and may mediate resistance to MAPK pathway targeted agents (PMID: 24265153, 24055054, 22197931).",
    "Truncating mutations in MAP2K4 result in loss of the C-terminus and subsequent loss of protein stability. Characterization of three truncating mutations (I295fs*23, W310*, R304*) demonstrated the loss of phosphorylation of downstream MAP2K4 substrate JNK1 and complete loss of MAP2K4 encoded protein MKK4 activity (PMID: 21896780)",
    ". In the same study, mouse lung cancer models, inactivation of MAP2K4 in conjunction with a KRAS G12D mutation resulted in an increased frequency and accelerated growth of lung neoplasias, and increased tumor cell migration and invasion (PMID: 21896780)",
    "MAP2K4 is a dual specificity kinase that directly phosphorylates and activates JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAP kinase (PMID: 7716521). MAP2K4 itself is phosphorylated and activated by one of several upstream MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKK). The activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways occurs in response to a variety of environmental stressors, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, heat shock, ionizing radiation, as well as inflammatory cytokines and growth factors (PMID: 17496914, 19629069). Activation of these signaling pathways leads to altered transcriptional activity of downstream effector molecules such as c-Jun, p53, ELK1, ATF2 and several other transcription factors involved in apoptosis, cell survival, growth and differentiation (PMID: 17496914, 19629069). Inactivating mutations in MAP2K4 have been identified in a variety of tumor cell lines and human cancers, suggesting that MAP2K4 functions primarily as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 9331070, 9622070, 17496914, 22522925). Loss of heterozygosity of the 17p chromosomal region, where MAP2K4 is located in close proximity to TP53, is observed at a high frequency in many cancers (PMID: 16721048, 16627982, 19603523). In addition, MAP2K4 has been found to act as a suppressor of metastasis in prostate and ovarian cell lines (PMID: 10554023, 12438272).",

    " (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Feb 2017). While some truncating mutations have been shown to be inactivating and oncogenic, because MAP3K1 can act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, others have been shown to be activating and oncogenic (PMID: 24386504, 24003131)",
    ". Multiple studies point to the link between MAP3K1 kinase activity, normal androgen receptor (AR) function and apoptosis in prostate cancer (PMID: 10373563, 11971970)",
    ". The AR plays a critical role in normal prostate development as well as contributes to prostate carcinogenesis. In one study, overexpression of a truncated, constitutively active MAP3K1 mutant protein led to caspase-dependant apoptosis in AR-positive prostate cancer cells. This effect was not observed in AR-negative cells or with a catalytically inactive form of MAP3K1 (PMID: 10373563)",
    ". In a separate study, it was shown that AR acetylation was necessary for MAP3K1 induced apoptosis (PMID: 11971970)",
    ". These results demonstrate the interplay between MAP3K1 and AR pathways and dependence of MAP3K1 induced apoptosis on the intact AR function in prostate cancer cells. (PMID: 24135036, 25899310, 25613373)",
    "(PMID: 24135036, 25899310, 25613373)",
    "The MAP3K1 gene encodes MEKK1, a kinase that signals in the pro-oncogenic MAP-kinase and JNK signaling pathways. MAP3K1 is unique among the MAPK signaling molecules in that it also acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for ERK1/2, thus allowing for the regulation of pathway output (PMID: 12049732, 25613373). Activation of MAP-kinase and JNK pathways occurs in response to a variety of stimuli such as environmental stress, inflammatory cytokines, pro-apoptotic signals and growth factors (PMID: 10639576, 9528810, 8621725, 11784851, 9078260). Activated MAP3K1 phosphorylates downstream effector molecules such as MAP2K4/7, MAP2K1/2, IKK alpha/beta and other transcription factors involved in apoptosis, cell survival, growth and differentiation (PMID: 7997270, 7624324, 9008162, 12471242) leading to activation of downstream signaling pathways. Germline mutations in MAP3K1 disrupt normal sex development and cause 46,XY sex development disorder (PMID: 21129722, 24135036). Truncating mutations and deletions in MAP3K1 mutations have been identified in breast cancer, predominantly in the luminal A subtype (PMID: 24386504), suggesting that MAP3K1 functions as a putative tumor suppressor. MAP3K1 may also promote oncogenesis and metastasis in some contexts. Elevated MAP3K1 expression has been found in human melanoma samples (PMID: 24003131) and MAP3K1 plays a pro-metastatic role in some cancers, as demonstrated by experimental studies in breast and pancreatic cancer models (PMID: 19513748, 16568086).",
    "MAP3K13 is a serine/threonine kinase that is a member of the JNK signaling pathway. MAP3K13 phosphorylates MAPK8 (JNK) and MAP2K7, resulting in activation of the JNK pathway (PMID: 11163770, 8637721), which is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activated in response to proinflammatory cytokines and extracellular stresses (PMID: 11163770) and functions as a regulator of cellular proliferation, apoptosis and morphogenesis (PMID: 9561845). Through the leucine/isoleucine zipper domain, MAP3K13 forms dimers or oligomers with other proteins, such as JNK interacting protein (JIP-1), an interaction that is essential for the activation of MKK7 in the JNK signaling cascade (PMID: 9353328, 11163770, 11726227). In addition, MAP3K13 has been found to interact with PRDX3 and regulates the activation of NF-κB in the cytosol (PMID: 12492477). MAP3K13 mRNA is found primarily in the pancreas, with lower levels of expression in the brain, liver and placenta (PMID: 9353328). Amplification and loss-of-function mutations in MAP3K13 are found in various solid tumors, including breast, lung cancer, and melanoma (PMID: 22722201, 22817889, 28760853).",
    "MAP3K14 (also NIK) is a serine/threonine kinase which is an important signaling molecule in the noncanonical NF-kB pathway (PMID: 15485626). Following ligand stimulation, the TRAFT2/3 ubiquitin ligase complex releases MAP3K14, which then phosphorylates and activates IKK-α. IKK-α homodimers phosphorylate and activate a precursor protein of the NF-kB complex, p100, triggering its cleavage and ultimately activation of the NF-kB cascade (PMID: 11520989, 11239468, 22435551). Through its role in NF-kB signaling, MAP3K14 influences a wide range of cellular processes, including regulation of B- and T-cells (PMID: 14764671, 16034105, 18799149, 10878354, 10637282), production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (PMID: 18997792, 18997794), formation of osteoclasts (PMID: 12939342) and response to viral infection (PMID: 9182687, 20685151, 18550535). Mice lacking MAP3K14 are immunodeficient, with a reduced B-cell population and a lack of lymph nodes (PMID: 11069060, 10878354, 8605936, 25406581), highlighting the importance of MAP3K14 in immune regulation. Overexpression of MAP3K14 has been linked to lethal liver inflammation and fibrosis. In obese mice, high levels of MAP3K14 result in hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance (PMID: 22581287, 25088600). MAP3K14 overexpression caused by amplification or translocation has been observed in various hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma (PMID: 17692804, 17692805, 21881048, 22469134). Although less common, aberrant expression of MAP3K14 has been observed in some solid tumor models, including pancreatic cancer, lung cancer and melanoma (PMID: 19646419, 20338663).",
    "MAP3K7 encodes for a serine/threonine protein kinase that functions in the MAP kinase signaling pathway to regulate various physiological cellular processes (PMID: 9079627, 8663074). MAP3K7 mediates signal transduction from various cytokines, including TGF-β, TLR and IL-1, to regulate transcription and apoptosis (PMID: 24801688, 10094049, 16845370, 16893890). MAP3K7 functions upstream of the MKK/JNK signal transduction cascade, which in turn activates MAP kinases that control various transcription factors (PMID: 11460167, 8663074). Knockdown of MAP3K7 in various cancer cell lines and models attenuates tumor formation and cellular proliferation, suggesting that MAP3K7 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 31214512, 28194669, 21834757, 21743023, 32523651). Amplification of MAP3K7 has been identified in various types of cancer, including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 28820959, 35053591). Clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of MAP3K7 inhibitors to trigger cell death in the context of various cancers (PMID: 28820959, 34676048, 32273474).",
    "MAP4K4, a member of the mammalian sterile 20 protein kinase family, is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates activation of the JNK signaling pathway (PMID: 10021364). TNFa upregulates the expression of MAP4K4 through a TNFR1-dependent mechanism (PMID: 17500068). MAP4K4 has been implicated in various physiological processes including embryonic development, inflammation, cell migration, cell proliferation and cell adhesion through activation of the JNK pathway (PMID: 11290295, 19407801, 35941177, 25490267). MAP3K11 (or MLK3) is an activator of the JNK pathway and is a direct downstream target of MAP4K4 phosphorylation (PMID: 34511598, 10232608). Inhibition of MAP4K4 in pancreatic cancer cell lines reduces cancer cell growth and migration, suggesting that MAP4K4 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 34511598). Overexpression of MAP4K4 has been identified in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer and lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 27010469, 18981001, 22824148). Alternative splice variants of MAP4K4 that retain the N-terminal kinase domain have been identified in various different human tissues with unknown biological significance (PMID: 12612079).",

    "MAPK1 (also known as ERK2) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as an effector protein in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade (PMID: 25435214, 17496922). The MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion and transcription (PMID: 25435214, 17496922). As a component of a three-tiered MAPK cascade, ERK2 activity is dependent on phosphorylation by upstream MEK1/2 kinases (PMID: 22177953). Activated ERK2 homodimerizes and phosphorylates downstream targets, including transcription factors with central roles in cell proliferation and survival such as RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase), MSK (mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases) and MYC (PMID: 25320010, 22569528). However, ERK2 targets also include upstream MAPK pathway effectors, highlighting the role ERK2 plays in negative feedback on the MAPK pathway (PMID: 15664191, 8816480). ERK2 targets also include cytoskeletal molecules and nucleoporins (PMID: 25320010, 22569528). These signaling events are triggered by growth factors, cytokines and hormones that activate upstream receptor tyrosine kinases, ultimately leading to altered expression of key regulators of cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and survival (PMID: 9069255, 11242034). ERK2 and its homolog, ERK1 (MAPK3), are essential for cell proliferation; they are ubiquitously and often simultaneously expressed, but evidence suggests they may have some distinct functions in specialized contexts (PMID: 23482492, 21248139, 17496918). ERK2 is infrequently mutated in human cancers; however, a recurrent ERK2 mutation is found in cervical and head and neck cancers and amplification is observed in ovarian cancer (PMID: 25631445, 21720365, 23820584). Inhibitors of ERK1/2 are being explored as complementary and alternative options to RAF and MEK inhibition in cases of resistance or partial response (PMID: 25435214).",

    "MAPKAP1 (also SIN1) is a component of the mTORC2 complex, which is involved in cell growth and cytoskeletal organization (PMID: 19339977). MAPKAP1 not only acts as a scaffold protein for mTORC2 complex formation but also as a key factor in mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of AKT (PMID: 24795562, 16962653, 17043309). Functional experiments have demonstrated that knockdown of MAPKAP1 activity results in reduced invasion and migration (PMID: 27993679). In addition, MAPKAP1 can bind RAS and suppress the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (PMID: 17303383). Somatic mutations in MAPKAP1 are infrequent in human cancers; however, MAPKAP1 expression levels are elevated in a subset of patients with breast cancer (PMID: 27780891).",
    "Incativating mutations and deletions of MAX have been described in the germline of patients with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, have been described as somatic mutations in small cell lung cancer and are associated with loss of heterozygosity.

    "MAX (Myc-associated factor X) is a transcription factor that is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZ) family (PMID: 8479534, 2006410). MAX functions at the center of a transcription factor network that governs many aspects of cell behavior, inducing cell proliferation, by binding to enhancer-boxes containing the CANNTG sequence (PMID: 16908182, 1557420). MAX lacks a transactivation domain, and thus MAX homodimers act as transcriptional repressors (PMID: 9824157). However, MAX also dimerizes with other bHLHZs such as MYC, MAD or MXL1 (PMID: 12553908). Heterodimers of MYC/MAX can bind and transactivate gene expression and promote cell proliferation and apoptosis. MAX is expressed in different splice-isoforms, each having different functions (PMID: 10229200, 1566084, 8426752). A \"delta MAX\" isoform, truncated at its C-terminus, appears to enhance MYC-driven tumorigenesis, whereas full-length MAX suppresses MYC-driven tumorigenesis (PMID: 1566084). Chromosomal rearrangements involving the MAX gene location at 14q22-q24 are common in several malignancies such as malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and uterine leiomyomas (PMID: 1594250). Germline loss-of-function mutations in the MAX gene are found in patients with hereditary pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas (PMID: 21685915, 22452945). Other studies, however, were not able to reproduce these findings in a separate cohort (PMID: 23743562).

The mismatch-specific glycosylase domain at the C-terminus of the protein functions in DNA mismatch repair in CpG methylation regions (PMID: 10930409, 10499592). MBD4-deficient mice demonstrate accelerated tumor formation in cancer-predisposing backgrounds and increased CpG mutation burden, suggesting that MBD4 functions primarily as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 12130785, 12417741). Loss of MBD4 has been identified in colorectal cancer, acute myeloid leukemia and uveal melanoma (PMID: 17285135, 35460607, 32421892, 30049810).",
    "MBD6 (also KIAA1887) is a chromatin-associated protein that is a member of the methyl-binding domain (MBD) protein family (PMID: 20700456, 12529184). Expression of MDB6 is most predominant in the brain and testes (PMID: 20700456, 16713569). MBD6 localizes to heterochromatin regions of DNA; however, this interaction is independent of DNA methylation (PMID: 20700456). MBD6 interacts with the Polycomb Repressive-Deubiquitinase Complex (PR-DUB), which removes monoubiquitin at lysine 119 on histone H2A, a critical protein complex involved in gene repression (PMID: 20436459, 24634419). The interaction of MBD6 with PR-DUB is mutually exclusive with family member MBD5, suggesting functional redundancies (PMID: 24634419). In addition, MBD6 binds to sites of DNA damage independent of PR-DUB (PMID: 24634419). MBD6 was also found to interact with the RNA binding protein ATXN1 in neuronal cells, and the protein has been implicated in self-renewal and cellular proliferation (PMID: 16713569, 23052207). Germline mutations in MBD6 are found in patients with autism and Wilson’s disease, a metabolic disorder which stems from accumulation of copper in tissues due to defective biliary excretion (PMID: 30230192, 23055267).

    "MCL1 (Myeloid cell leukemia 1) is a member of the BCL2 pro-survival protein family (PMID: 11960321, 18955968, 23478333). The BCL2 family is defined by the presence of BCL2 homology (BH) domains. MCL1, similar to BCL2, confers cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis. Together with BCL2, MCL1 regulates mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and activation of caspases (PMID: 21763611, 20683470). Genome-wide studies have identified increased gene copy numbers of MCL1 across many cancer entities (PMID: 20164920). Focal amplifications of MCL1 were found in over 10% of cancers and were even higher in lung and breast cancers (PMID: 20164920). MCL1 expression can drive lymphomagenesis (PMID: 9787159) and is required for lung adenocarcinoma formation (PMID: 21406400), possibly through interaction with AKT (PMID: 31662324). Through inhibition of apoptosis, MCL1 leads to increased survival of cancer cells and resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli (PMID: 23478333).

MDC1 binds to sites of DNA double-stranded breaks through its SDT domain, which binds to the MRN complex, and its BRCT domain which binds to phospho-H2AX (PMID: 16377563, 11741547, 16618811, 15201865). The main functions of MDC1 are to regulate the cell cycle check points in S and G2/M phase through Chk1/2 and to regulate TP53 apoptotic response to DNA damage (PMID: 12607005, 11100718, 12607004, 12607003, 16427009). MDC1 binds TP53 through its BRC1 domain which inhibits TP53 transactivation domain (PMID: 17535811, 24194938). Loss of MDC1 results in genomic instability and promotes oncogenesis in a variety of cancer entities (PMID: 17546051). In some cancers, however, oncogenic functions of MDC1 have been observed (PMID: 21853275).",
    "MDM2 amplification results from the gain of the MDM2 gene on chromosome 12q13-15 and is found in a variety of cancers. Often, this amplification leads to overexpression of the MDM2 protein, which has been demonstrated to contribute to tumorigenesis by impairing TP53-mediated tumor suppressor effects in the context of wildtype TP53 (PMID: PMID: 15199139, 24667108)",

    "The MDM2 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates the p53 tumor suppressor protein (PMID: 8875929, 1535557, 25550083). The MDM2-p53 interaction blocks the activation domain of p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity (PMID: 8875929, 25550083, 7686617). Additionally, the MDM2-p53 interaction results in increased proteasomal degradation of the p53 protein (PMID: 8653711, 9153396, 9153395, 9382809). Transcription of the MDM2 gene is directly activated by p53, and levels of both p53 and MDM2 are maintained at low levels in unstressed cells (PMID: 8265599, 8440237, 8319905). Cells may acquire oncogenic potential from p53 loss (50% of tumors) or MDM2 amplification, which cripple the p53 pathway in tumor cells (PMID: 10549356, 23161690, 9671804, 20025780). Recently, numerous studies targeting the interaction between p53 and MDM2 have resulted in the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at normalizing p53 levels in tumor cells (PMID: 14704432, 15715460, 16759082, 15956260, 17126603, 14704432, 15715460, 16759082, 15956260, 17126603).",

    "MDM4 is a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, the most frequently inactivated gene in human cancer (PMID: 25960041, 22154076). The two major negative regulators of p53, MDM2 and MDM4, function by blocking its N-terminal transactivation domain (PMID: 21730163). In addition, MDM4 stimulates the MDM2-catalysed ubiquitination of p53 which leads to its degradation (PMID: 14507994, 12162806). Similar to MDM2, MDM4 is deregulated in several tumor types such as cutaneous melanoma, primary breast tumors, retinoblastomas (PMID: 17080083), Ewing sarcomas (PMID: 21098696) and gliomas (PMID: 22820643, 15199139, 12640683, 11280734). In the overwhelming majority of cases, cells with deregulated MDM2 or MDM4 retain wild-type p53 (PMID: 23303139). Thus, inhibition of the p53 interaction with MDM2 or MDM4 is an attractive candidate strategy for the treatment of cancer via the reactivation of p53 (PMID: 25621298, 21098696, 20080970, 14704432, 25201201, 23374098, 16905541, 16540668).",

    "MECOM (also EVI1) is a transcription factor that is encoded by the MDS1 and EVI1 complex (MECOM) gene locus (PMID: 26729571). MECOM expression is restricted to long and short term hematopoietic stem cells and is transcriptionally silent during hematopoietic differentiation (PMID: 21666053). MECOM functions as a DNA binding protein that regulates the expression of many hematopoietic genes, including SPI1, a master regulator of myelopoiesis (PMID: 30315161). In addition, MECOM activity regulates additional cellular functions including proliferation, apoptosis, and chromatin state (PMID: 28538183). MECOM was identified as an oncogene in retroviral integration assays, which revealed that MECOM could transform murine hematopoietic cells (PMID: 2542863, 2827004). Increased expression of MECOM in hematopoietic assays and murine models leads to ineffective differentiation and skewing towards the expansion of myeloid populations (PMID: 1370341, 8321231). Recurrent MECOM rearrangements are found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID: 19016745, 15156182), resulting in increased EVI1 activity. Overexpression of MECOM is also common in myeloid malignancies and breast cancers, suggesting that MECOM functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 18272813, 28209621). EVI1 alterations may require cooperation with other genetic events to drive transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 17227832).",
    "In a study of lung cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, MED12 knockdown was shown to make the drug-sensitive cell lines H3122, PC9 and H3255, A375, and SW1417 resistant to ALK inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, and BRAF/MEK inhibitors, respectively. Knockdown of MED12 in these cell lines led to higher levels of phosphorylated MEK and ERK, and that drug resistance was mediated by elevation of TGF-βR2 protein levels, leading in turn to activation of TGF-β signaling. The activation of TGF-β signaling was shown to be both necessary and resistant for drug resistance across all cell lines (PMID: 23178117)",
    "MED12 is a component of the CDK8 subcomplex that is involved in transcription initiation. The MED12 protein is essential for activating CDK8 kinase. The CDK8 subcomplex which includes MED13, CDK8 kinase and cyclin C, modulates mediator-polymerase II interactions thereby regulating transcription initiation and reinitiation rates (RefSeq August 2009). The most commonly seen mutations in MED12 are in exon 2. Mutations in this domain have been described in uterine leiomyomas (PMID: 25108465, 24980722, 23443020, 23738515), breast fibroadenomas (PMID: 25038752), and Phyllodes tumors of the breast (PMID: 25593300). In benign breast tumors, MED12 hotspot mutations are thought to be early events that lead to deregulation of estrogen signaling (PMID: 25593300). MED12 is the most frequently mutated gene in uterine leiomyomas, suggesting it has a major role in the development of these lesions (PMID: 25108465). MED12 somatic exon 2 mutations have also been described in uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (PMID: 23132392). The presence of the same MED12 mutations in uLMS as in uterine leiomyomas suggests that a subgroup of the malignant tumors may develop from a leiomyoma precursor. Leucine (L) to Phenylalanine (F) mutations at amino acid 1224 have been described in prostate cancer. These mutations are thought to play a role in tumorigenesis via perturbation of transcriptional programs linked to p53 and androgen signaling (PMID: 22610119).",

    "MEF2B is a transcription factor that has a role in mediating differentiation in heart and skeletal muscle (PMID: 17959722). MEF2B regulates transcriptional programs that facilitate cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition as well as the cancer genes MYC, TGFB1, CARD11, RHOB and NDRG1 (PMID: 26245647). Consistent with a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, overexpression of MEF2B in human cell lines results in increased cell migration (PMID: 26506234). MEF2B has been found to be amplified in several cancer types including ovarian serous cystadenocarcinomas, adrenocortical carcinomas and esophageal carcinomas (PMID: 26506234). Recurrent somatic mutations in MEF2B have been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (PMID: 21796119, 22343534, 21804550, 23292937), follicular lymphoma (FL) (PMID: 21796119) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (PMID: 24145436). The recurrence of MEF2B mutations at particular residues is consistent with the notion that MEF2B mutations have either gain-of-function or dominant negative effects on MEF2B activity. Mutations in MEF2B in DLBCL lead to increased transcription of BCL6, a proto-oncogene essential for DLBCL germinal center proliferation and decreased association with the co-repressor CABIN1 (PMID: 23974956). However, other data suggest that MEF2B mutations lead to loss of DNA binding and decreased DLBCL cell chemotaxis (PMID: 26245647).",
    "MEF2C, a Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 family transcription factor, is an early expressed gene that is a direct transcriptional target of ETS transcription factors and which binds to the MEF2 element in muscle-specific genes to promote muscle differentiation. In addition to its role in myogenesis, MEF2C expression is critical for the development of the neural system, vascular endothelium, heart and bone (PMID: 15501228, 29340119). MEF2C has been shown to have a role in hematopoietic cell differentiation, particularly germinal center formation in B-cells (PMID: 18955699). Germline haploinsufficiency of MEF2C has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders associated with cognitive disability and epilepsy, highlighting its importance in neural differentiation (PMID: 23389741). In cancer, MEF2C contributes to oncogenicity by enhancing the invasion and stemness of cancer cells, and may act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene depending on the cancer context (PMID: 16862118, 23435431, 21481790, 25328135, 24043307, 25404735).",

    "MEF2D is a transcription factor that is a member of the myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) protein family (PMID: 29879430). Gene expression programs necessary for muscle, neuronal, and B-cell differentiation, among other cell types, are modulated by MEF2D activity (PMID: 20716948, 26660426). MEF2D predominantly functions as a transcriptional activator and interacts with other co-activators and chromatin-modifying proteins (e.g. MYOD, p300 and PCAF) to regulate context-specific target gene expression (PMID: 20716948, 32512162, 32512162, 31722213). However, MEF transcription factors can also function as transcriptional repressors (PMID: 28419090). MEF2D expression is important for a variety of cellular activities including proliferation, DNA damage response and cell cycle progression (PMID: 29879430, 24672010, 26506234). The activity of MEF2D has also been linked to the regulation of oxidative stress and pro-survival gene programs (PMID: 2512162). Aberrant MEF2D localization and activity have been linked to cancer progression in a variety of cancer types (PMID: 28419090, 29218083, 25814384).

    "MGA (MAX-gene associated protein) is a dual-specificity transcription factor that regulates the expression of MAX-target genes and T-box family target genes. MAX is a transcription factor that heterodimerizes with other basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZ) family members, including MYC and MXI1, to regulate the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation. As part of this network, MGA contains a MYC-like bHLHZip motif and heterodimerize with MAX to bind to MYC-MAX DNA binding sites (PMID: 10601024). MGA contains a second DNA-binding domain, known as the T-domain, that binds to genes containing Brachyury-binding sites. In vitro studies demonstrated that MGA can function as a transcriptional activator or repressor, and transcriptional activation is dependent on MAX (PMID: 10601024). MGA loss of function mutations have been observed in lung cancer, leukemia and lymphoma, and are mutually exclusive with MYC amplifications (PMID: 25079552, 26192917, 23039309, 23047824).",
    "MGAM (also MGA) is a glucosidase that regulates the digestion of starch to glucose (PMID: 17592362). MGAM and a second glucosidase, sucrose isomaltase (SI), are responsible for the last enzymatic step that results in the release of glucose during starch digestion (PMID: 18036614, 21924903). Starch digestion initially involves breakdown by α-amylases into small malto-oligosaccharides, which then are hydrolyzed by glucosidases (PMID: 22851177, 23838818). The main enzymatic activity of MGAM is to hydrolyze short, linear alpha-1,4-oligosaccharides, resulting in the production of glucose to the lumen (PMID: 20356844, 22058037). Dietary restriction alters chromatin modifications at the MGAM promoter, suggesting that gene expression is regulated by diet (PMID: 22819554). MGAM expression is localized to gastric tissues and is predominantly found anchored to the brush border membrane of the intestinal mucosa (PMID: 3143729, 18036614). Loss of MGAM expression in mice results in the inability to increase intestinal alpha-glucosidic activities in response to a starch-based diet, implicating MGAM in glucose homeostasis (PMID: 19193815). Somatic mutations in MGAM are rare; however, overexpression and amplification of MGAM have been found in several tumor types including gastric and oral cancers, among others (PMID: 17611641, 23405089). In addition, MGAM has been identified as a possible serum biomarker in intestinal cancer (PMID: 23924158) and a proposed drug target for type 2 diabetes (PMID: 22058037).",
    "MIDEAS deletion mutations typically result in the loss of protein expression. In vitro studies with MIDEAS-knockout U2OS cells demonstrate that loss of MIDEAS is inactivating as measured by increased mitotic chromosome misalignment compared to vector control (PMID: 32591534)",
    "MIDEAS is a chromatin-associated protein that shares sequence homology with the REST co-repressor (PMID: 21258344). MIDEAS was identified in a proteomic study to identify interactions of proteins with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (PMID: 21258344). HDAC complexes remove acetyl groups from histone molecules, typically leading to gene repression and compacted chromatin (PMID: 17694093, 26908329). MIDEAS functions in the mitotic deacetylase complex (MiDAC) in association with class I HDACs (HDAC1 and HDAC2) and DNTTIP1, a DNA polymerase involved in the generation of diverse immunoglobulin genes (PMID: 21258344); however, several non-canonical MiDAC complexes have also been elucidated (PMID: 21258344). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the MiDAC complex has increased HDAC activity in arrested cells (PMID: 21258344). In addition, MIDEAS associates with HDAC1 in mouse embryonic stem cells and controls the expression of neurodevelopmental gene programs via deacetylation of lysine 20 on histone 4 (PMID: 21258344). MIDEAS has been associated with histone acetylation at lysine 27 on histone H3, suggesting a role in active transcription (PMID: 25755260).",

MITF regulates the proliferation and differentiation of neural crest melanocyte progenitor cells (PMID: 16862190). It cooperates with BRAF mutations in the transformation process of melanocytes to malignant melanoma. MITF is amplified in >15% of metastatic melanoma (PMID: 12789286). The proliferative activity seems to be mediated by Ink4a, RB1 and CDK2, and MITF has anti-apoptotic activity mediated by BCL2 (PMID: 12086670, 15607961, 15623583, 15716956).",
    "MKI67 (Ki-67) is a non-histone nuclear protein involved in the formation of the perichromosomal layer that helps chromosome organization during mitosis by preventing chromosomal aggregation (PMID: 24867636). Levels of Ki-67 protein are regulated by the cell cycle (PMID: 28283655). Thus, as Ki-67 is only expressed in proliferating cells, it is commonly used as an immunohistochemical marker of cell proliferation in vitro and in tumor samples (PMID: 10837136). While early studies investigated the requirement of Ki-67 for cell proliferation (PMID: 12740923) and ribosomal RNA synthesis (PMID: 17531085) more recent studies have demonstrated that it is not essential for either (PMID: 26823390, 26949251). Ki-67 is rarely overexpressed or mutated in cancer; however, it is critical for tumor formation, tumor growth, regulation of global transcription, promotion of stemness, and metastasis (PMID: 33658388).",
    "Deletion of MLH1 is predicted to promote the loss of MLH1 expression. Reduced expression of MLH1 is associated with defects in the mismatch repair pathway and increased tumor microsatellite instability due to the inability of MLH1 to heterodimerize with one of its molecular partners, thereby preventing effective endonuclease activity necessary for mismatch repair (PMID: 12697830, 11793442, 20533529, 20864418, 18337503, 17135187)",

    "MLH1 is a DNA mismatch repair protein. MLH1 functions to correct mismatched nucleotides and insertion/deletion loops that are erroneously incorporated into the newly synthesized strand of DNA during replication, using the parental strand of DNA as a template. As part of this pathway, MLH1 heterodimerizes with PMS2 (most commonly), PMS1 or MLH3 to form an endonuclease complex that incises the damaged strand, leading to its local excision (PMID: 10037723, 10542278, 10615123). Mutations in MLH1 lead to an inability to correctly repair mismatches and insertion/deletion loops, which are most frequently associated with microsatellite repeat sequences. Tumors with inactivating MLH1 mutations are likely to exhibit a microsatellite instability-high phenotype (PMID: 9823339, 12454837). Mutations in MLH1 occur in multiple tissue types, but are most common in a specific subset of sporadic colon, gastric and endometrial cancers, as well as the inherited lynch syndrome, sometimes referred to as hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) (PMID: 8484122, 8040889, 8261393). Defects in the MMR pathway have been associated with improved response to radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy (PMID: 20153885, 26028255), and the FDA has approved the immunotherapy pembrolizumab for all mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) and MSI tumors, irrespective of specific tumor etiology.",
    "Truncating mutations of MLH3 typically result in the loss of protein function. In vitro studies with COS7 cells expressing truncated MLH3 variants demonstrate that truncating mutations are inactivating as measured by the inability to interact with the DNA mismatch repair complex and increased microsatellite instability compared to wildtype (PMID: 10615123)",
    "MLH3, a member of MLH family, encodes for a DNA mismatch repair protein that functions in preventing microsatellite instability (MSI) and promoting meiotic crossover (PMID: 10615123, 23316435). MLH3 heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form an endonuclease complex that incises damaged DNA strands leading to local excision (PMID: 34088835, 10615123). Knockdown of MLH3 in various cancer cell lines and models induces MSI, impairs DNA damage response, and increases susceptibility to tumors such as gastrointestinal tumors, suggesting that MLH3 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 16204034). Inactivating mutations of MLH3 have been identified in various types of cancer, including hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer and gastric cancer (PMID: 18521850, 16885347, 18551179).",
    "MLLT1 (also ENL) is a transcriptional adaptor protein that is a member of the eleven-nineteen leukemia (ENL) family (PMID: 17855633, 20153263, 28241139). MLLT1 associates with the super elongation transcription complex composed of p-TEFb (Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b), a protein complex implicated in the phosphorylation of RNA pol II (PMID: 20153263), and other KMT2A-associated adaptor proteins involved in transactivation (PMID: 17855633). The super elongation complex targets KMT2A, a hematopoietic transcriptional coactivator, to hematopoietic genes to initiate transcription (PMID: 20153263). MLLT1 interacts with a variety of proteins involved in chromatin regulation, such as the histone H3 K79 methyltransferase DOT1L, and other KMT2A-related adaptor proteins (PMID: 17855633, 17957188, 15856011). Activating mutations in MLLT1 have been identified in patients with Wilm's tumor and these alterations impact the binding of MLLT1 to histone tails (PMID: 26635203). MLLT1 is the third most common fusion partner of KMT2A, a commonly rearranged gene in hematopoietic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 23628958). Mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells engineered to express MLLT1 fusion proteins exhibit altered hematopoietic lineage identity, clonal expansion and transformation in functional assays (PMID: 28572162, 28572162, 17957188, 28068328). MLLT1-rearranged proteins are aberrantly targeted to KMT2A target genes, leading to activation of gene expression programs that promote transformation (PMID: 20153263, 27050521). DOT1L inhibitors or therapeutics targeting transcriptional elongation, such as BRD4 inhibitors, may be efficacious in patients with MLLT1 rearrangements (PMID: 31157223).",

    "MLLT10 (also AF10) is a histone methyltransferase cofactor that is a member of the MLL family of PHD finger proteins (PMID: 7888665). MLLT10 regulates the methylation of H3K79 on histone H3, a histone mark that is predominantly found within gene bodies (PMID: 21724828). Histone proteins are an essential component of the nucleosome, which consists of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones) and histone methylation results in the activation or repression of gene expression in different contexts (PMID: 11498575). Methylation of H3K79 has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions including DNA repair, cellular differentiation, splicing, cell cycle, and regulation of transcription, among others (PMID: 27234562). Binding of MLLT10 to chromatin, in collaboration with the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, mediates the conversion of H3K79me1 to H3K79me2, which serves as a signal for gene expression changes important in several differentiation programs including at the HOXA locus (PMID: 25464900, 21724828). Reduced expression of MLLT10 results in weakened transforming ability in hematopoietic assays, suggesting that MLLT10 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 25464900). Recurrent fusion proteins containing MLLT10 have been identified in patients with hematopoietic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia and T-ALL (PMID: 23673860, 28242784, 23673860). MLLT10-rearrangements are predicted to bind chromatin and activate DOT1L H3K79-methyltransferase activity (PMID: 28242784, 15851025). Hematopoietic malignancies with aberrant MLLT10 activity may be sensitive to DOT1L inhibitors, as demonstrated in functional assays (PMID: 25464900).",
    "MLLT3 fusions generally arise from chromosomal translocations that fuse the N-terminal end of a partner gene with the C-terminal end of MLLT3, such that the fusion proteins exclude the MLLT3 YEATS domain.

    "MLLT3, or A9, is a subunit of the super elongation complex, which plays a key role in the regulation of the transcriptional elongation checkpoint of transcription (PMID: 20159561). MLLT3 is a key regulator of the self-renewal of human hematopoietic stem cells through the maintenance of their transcriptional program (PMID: 31776511). In coordination with the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, MLLT3 localizes to active transcription start sites through its YEATS domain (PMID: 31776511). The YEATS domain of MLLT3 recognizes crotonylated histone H3 and links crotonylation to active transcription (PMID: 27105114). Knocked-down expression of MLLT3 in cell lines results in suppressed cell proliferation and JNK signaling (PMID: 31966817). MLLT3 rearrangements that result in truncation and loss of the YEATS domain promote tumorigenesis through aberrant gene transcription (PMID: 31776511). MLLT3 fusion proteins have been identified in a variety of tumor types including osteosarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 31966817, 20844554). MLLT3 rearrangements may be sensitive to DOT1L inhibitors, as demonstrated in functional assays (PMID: 25464900).",
    "MOB3B (also MOBKL2B) is a kinase activator that shares homology with the MOB family of proteins (PMID: 28792927). While the function of MOB3B is unknown, MOB3B is a paralog of MOB1A/B, components of the Hippo signaling pathway (PMID: 28792927). MOB proteins bind activated Hippo, resulting in the recruitment and activation of the signaling factor LATS (PMID: 30183404). The MOB-LATS complex recruits additional signaling proteins and controls the activity of the downstream transcription factors YAP and TAZ (PMID: 30183404). In addition, MOB proteins have been implicated in the regulation of mitotic checkpoint regulation, cellular proliferation and spindle pole body duplication (PMID: 18328423, 9436989). Deletions in MOB3B are found in patients with mantle cell lymphoma and these alterations are associated with poorer patient outcome (PMID: 20421449, 18984860). In addition, MOB3B overexpression has been implicated in resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors vemurafenib and cetuximab (PMID: 28792927, 29802456), likely due to altered Hippo signaling (PMID: 28792927).",
    "MPEG1 (also Perforin-2) is a pore forming protein that perforates target cell membranes or bacterial envelopes (PMID: 27857713, 7888681, 23257510). MPEG1 is a membrane protein that is most highly expressed in macrophages and is involved in the host defense against intracellular and extracellular bacteria (PMID: 7888681, 25717326, 28705375). Pore-forming proteins, such as MPEG1, homopolymerize resulting in a hollow hydrophobic cylinder that allows for insertion into the membrane or bacterial cell walls (PMID: 27857713, 20860583). Following the MPEG1-mediated immune attack, pore clusters render bacteria susceptible to secondary attack by antimicrobial effectors including reactive oxygen species, the lysozyme and proteases (PMID: 26402460, 26402460). MPEG1 is a largely unspecific effector in innate immunity and is conserved across multicellular organisms (PMID: 26307549). The unspecific mechanism of MPEG1 allows for the clearance of Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and acid-fast bacteria (PMID: 27857713). Expression of MPEG1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in the ability to clear bacteria from the culture, unlike wildtype cells (PMID: 23257510). Loss of MPEG1 expression in model organisms results in an abnormal immune response and the inability to effectively combat bacterial infection (PMID: 25247677, 28422754, 30249808, 26831467). Mutations in MPEG1 are found in patients with persistent nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and immune cells isolated from these patients are unable to kill bacteria in functional assays (PMID: 28422754). Somatic mutations in MPEG1 are infrequent in human cancers.",

    "MPL encodes for the myeloproliferative leukemia proto-oncogene, thrombopoietin receptor. The gene was first identified in as the oncogene v-mpl, from the murine myeloproliferative leukemia virus that transformed hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow in mice (PMID: 7836743). The normal receptor protein is critical in growth and regulation of megakaryocytes and platelet production (PMID: 8202154). The gene is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular cytokine binding domain and intracellular cytokine signaling domains. Binding of its ligand, thrombopoietin (TPO), results in receptor dimerization and activation of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases; this leads to activation of the STAT family of transcription factors (PMID: 7796811). The MAPK pathway can also be activated as a result of receptor activation (PMID: 10438715). The most common mutations, W515L and W515K, which activate receptor signaling are found in myeloproliferative neoplasms such as essential thrombocytosis and myelofibrosis (PMID: 16834459). Aberrant expression of MPL has been reported in some solid tumors. In a study of 128 colorectal cancer cases, higher MPL expression was associated with metastasis to liver and lung (PMID: 23747337). However, in a study of 118 breast tumors and 29 lung tumors, MPL mRNA was either not detectable or at very low levels (PMID: 22967017). The thromobopoietin receptor can be activated by administration of drug agonists such as eltrombopag and romiplostim. These therapies have been approved for the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (PMID: 18046028, 7050891).",

    "MRE11 is a member of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs (MRN) complex involved in sensing and repairing DNA double strand breaks (PMID: 10523656, 11430828). The complex activates the kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM- and RAD3-related) to initiate DNA damage responses and is itself phosphorylated by ATM (PMID: 23525106, 23582259, 26512707). MRE11 has DNA nuclease activity important for stimulating repair (PMID: 18854157). Activation of the MRN complex enables the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint in response to DNA damage (PMID: 14657032). The complex is also important for genomic integrity at telomeres, replication forks, immunoglobulin gene loci during rearrangements, and DNA breaks formed in meiosis (PMID: 19667071, 21565612, 16285919, 17291760). Activation of repair mechanisms include non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair (PMID: 12422221, 24316220). Mutations in MRE11 are associated with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, resulting in chromosomal instability and sensitivity to ionizing radiation (PMID: 10612394). MRE11 is also a familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene and mutations have also been identified in endometrial, colorectal, and lymphoid cancers (PMID: 19383352, 24549055, 24894818, 23755103, 11196167, 11850399, 16959974). MRE11 polymorphisms and mutations affect response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibitors (PMID: 24623370, 25310185, 24927325, 24215868, 25324139, 24240112).",
    "MS4A1, which encodes the B-cell surface marker CD20, is a member of the MS4A (membrane-spanning 4-domains family, subfamily A) family that is comprised of proteins that span the cellular membrane four times (PMID: 25835430, 35091527). MS4A1 functions in B-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation (PMID: 33352466, 35091527). MS4A1 can associate with a variety of membrane proteins, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, MHC class II, tetraspanins (CD53, CD81, and CD82), and CD40; however the exact nature of these associations are still unknown (PMID: 25835430, 32482755). MS4A1 is involved in calcium conductance, as it functions as a store-operated calcium (SOC) channel that promotes calcium influx through physical association with the B-cell receptor (BCR) (PMID: 25835430). MS4A1 is required for optimal humoral immunity, as MS4A1 deficiency in both humans and mice results in impaired immune responses (PMID: 25835430, 32482755). In colorectal cancer, MS4A1 is significantly downregulated and CD20 expression is positively correlated with the patient survival rate (PMID: 33352466). In ovarian cancer, CD20-positive T-cells were shown to be elevated in ascites fluid of patients and were associated with a positive prognosis, as these cells mediate antitumor immunity (PMID: 26137418, 34654826). In breast cancer, patients who demonstrated higher MS4A1 expression also had a better prognosis (PMID: 35091527). CD20 expression is a clinically useful biomarker for B-cell targeted monoclonal antibody therapies, including rituximab, ofatumumab and obinutuzumab (PMID: 34654826, 25835430, 32482755).",

    "The MSH2 (MutS protein homolog 2) protein is a tumor suppressor involved in the mismatch repair process. MSH2 forms heterodimers with other MutS proteins, MSH6 and MSH3, to form the MutS-alpha and MutS-beta mismatch repair (MMR) complexes, respectively (PMID: 8252616, 7973733). Both complexes are involved in the recognition of a mismatched base pair, forming a DNA-MutS complex that signals other components of the MMR machinery to excise the aberrant nucleotide. MSH2 and other MMR genes are most notably implicated in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome (PMID: 428275, 1648437). Loss of function mutations or epigenetic silencing both in the germline and somatic context lead to an increased mutation rate that drives carcinogenesis as well as microsatellite instability (MSI). MSH2 mutations represent approximately 40% of all HNPCC cases (PMID: 11852992) and are associated with the MSI-high phenotype, along with mutations in MLH1 (PMID: 9823339, 9354436). Although most commonly seen in colon cancer, MSH2 mutations have also been reported in a diverse range of other cancer types and syndromes, including endometrial and uterine cancers, and sebaceous gland tumors (PMID: 19078925, 16826164). Tumors with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair defects have been predictive of clinical benefit to certain immune checkpoint blockade therapies (PMID: 26028255, 25409260). Recently, the FDA approved pembrolizumab (PD-1 blockade) for all mismatch repair deficient and microsatellite unstable (MSI-high) tumors, irrespective of specific tumor etiology.",

    "MSH3 encodes the protein MutS Homolog 3 (MSH3) ,the human homolog of the bacterial MutS protein, which functions in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway of DNA repair. MSH3 partners with MSH2 to form the heterodimer MutS-beta, which is important for recognition and repair of mismatched base pairs, forming a DNA-MutS complex which signals other components of the MMR machinery to excise the aberrant nucleotide (PMID: 22179786, 8942985, 9679053). MSH3 deletion or loss-of-function mutations can result in MMR deficiency, leading to an increased mutation rate and increased tumorigenesis in cooperation with loss of MSH6 (PMID: 10706084). MSH3 is altered in nearly 50% of MMR-deficient colorectal cancers by somatic frameshift mutations (PMID: 23724141, 18922920, 14871813, 9331106).

    "The MSH6 (mutS homolog 6) gene encodes the DNA repair mismatch protein MSH6. MSH6 is a tumor suppressor which heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS-alpha. This complex recognizes single base pair mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops, initiating the mismatch repair (MMR) process (PMID: 8816473).

    "MSI1 (Musashi1) is an RNA-binding protein which binds to the consensus RNA sequence GU3-5(G/AG) on specific mRNAs and controls their expression by translational repression (PMID: 22201732). The Musashi family of RNA-binding proteins is known to be important for cell fate determination, neural development and maintenance of stem-cell state, differentiation and tumorigenesis. Musashi1 is selectively expressed in neural progenitor cells, including neural stem cells (PMID: 9790759). Musashi1, in cooperation with Musashi2, activates Notch signaling through translational repression of Numb mRNA, an intracellular Notch signal repressor, and maintains the self-renewing ability of neural stem cells (NSCs) (PMID: 15925591). Musashi1 also activates the WNT pathway and serves to sustain mammary gland stem cell pools (PMID: 18362162). In addition, Musashi1 is a selective marker for intestinal stem or early lineage cells (PMID: 12924647, 15925591). Elevated Musashi1 expression is found in gliomas and glioblastomas and correlates with tumor proliferation (PMID: 11284014, 11896183), however, Musashi1 is infrequently mutated in human cancers.",
    "MSI2 (Musashi2) is an RNA-binding protein which binds to the consensus RNA sequences on specific mRNAs and controls their expression in part by translational repression (PMID: 28143872). The Musashi family of RNA-binding proteins is known to be important for cell fate determination, neural development and maintenance of stem-cell state, differentiation and tumorigenesis. Musashi2, like Musashi1, activates Notch signaling through translational repression of Numb mRNA, an intracellular Notch signal repressor, and maintains the self-renewing ability of neural stem cells (NSCs) (PMID: 15925591). In addition, Musashi2 expression is required for self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells in early stages of differentiation (PMID: 22496868). Musashi2 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and is important in the maintenance of the stem cell compartment and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (PMID: 21613258). Overexpression of Musashi2 in mouse models cooperates with the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein to drive aggressive leukemia (PMID: 20616797). Musashi2 is overexpressed in human myeloid leukemias and increased expression directly correlates with survival of patients with the disease (PMID: 20616797, 20639863); however, Musashi2 is infrequently mutated in human cancers.",
    "Truncating mutations of MST1 can occur throughout the gene and typically result in loss of protein function. In vitro studies with COS-7 cells expressing N-terminal and C-terminal truncated variants of MST1 demonstrate that C-terminal truncation of MST1 is inactivating as measured by decreased interaction with AR compared to wildtype and N-terminal truncated MST1 (PMID: 21512132)",
    "MST1 (mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1) is an intracellular kinase and key component of the Hippo signaling pathway. The Hippo signaling cascade is a critical regulator for controlling cell growth, differentiation and organ size control (PMID: 22683405, 22898666). MST1 is proteolyticaly activated by caspases during apoptosis; activation is mediated by apoptotic stimuli and other stress signals. Full activation of MST1 kinase requires autophosphorylation at Thr-183 and caspase-mediated cleavage. Once activated, MST1 phosphorylates Lats1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1/2), which then phosphorylates and inhibits two transcriptional coactivators in the Hippo pathway, YAP and TAZ (PMID: 17889654). Phosphorylated YAP and TAZ remain in the cytoplasm and cannot induce the expression of genes that promote cell growth and proliferation (PMID: 17889654). Hence, MST1 negatively regulates YAP and TAZ and acts as a tumor suppressor. Reduced expression of MST1 has been observed in gastric cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer and soft tissue sarcoma (PMID: 21940329, 17538946, 18381433).",
    "MST1R (Macrophage Stimulating 1 Receptor) is a cell surface receptor for macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP). The MST1R protein is one of two members of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase family, along with parent receptor MET. Activation of MST1R triggers downstream signaling cascades, including RAS, PI3-kinase (PI3-K), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) to induce cell scattering, migration, survival and invasion (PMID: 12807733, 18836480, 25997828). MST1R is expressed in various cell types including macrophages, epithelial and hematopoietic cells. MST1R is overexpressed in pancreatic and epithelial cancers of the breast, colon, lung, and prostate (PMID: 22834780, 17616662, 17311308, 26477314, 15289319), and is involved in tumor progression and metastasis (PMID: 15289319, 10910951, 19956854). MST1R is rarely mutated, but alternative splicing events are common as the gene transcript is increasingly overexpressed. Approximately eight different MST1R isoforms have been described in various epithelial cancer types (PMID: 23792360). In breast cancer, short-form MST1R overexpression specifically activates the PI3K signaling pathway, resulting in increased tumor growth, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and metastasis (PMID: 22207901). In prostate cancer cells, MST1R has been shown to regulate angiogenic chemokine production (PMID: 19838218). Additionally, one study using gastroesophageal carcinoma (GEC) samples reported increased MST1R gene copy number in 35.5% (16/45) of cases and a novel somatic MST1R juxtamembrane mutation (R1018G) in 11% of samples, making MST1R an important prognostic marker in this GEC cohort (PMID: 21543897).",

    "MTAP is a methylthioadenosine phosphorylase that is a regulator of polyamine metabolism (PMID: 27068473, 26912360). MTAP metabolizes 2-methylthiosdenosine (MTA), a byproduct of polyamine synthesis, for the salvage of methionine amino acids and adenine nucleotides (PMID: 21301207). Loss of MTAP results in increased sensitivity to purine starvation and has been linked to regulation of stemness, apoptosis, and inflammation (PMID: 31040154, 30854099). The MTAP gene resides within the 9p21 chromosomal region, which is deleted in 15% of all cancers (PMID: 27068473). The 9p21 region includes the tumor suppressors CDKN2A, p16-INK4A, and p19-ARF; MTAP co-deletion with these genes occurs in a majority of 9p21 deletions (PMID: 27068473, 26912360). Deletion of MTAP in cancer cell lines results in the accumulation of MTA, a metabolic inhibitor of the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, due to reduced MTAP-mediated byproduct cleavage (PMID: 27068473, 26912360). PRMT5 activity and expression of PRMT5 binding partners are downregulated in MTAP-deleted cancer cells, including RIOK1 and WDR77 (PMID: 27068473, 26912360). Functional studies demonstrated that MTAP-deleted cancer cell lines have an increased sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibitors, and PRMT5 inhibitors may be an efficacious therapeutic strategy in 9p21-deleted cancers (PMID: 27068473, 26912360, 31257072). In addition, MAT2A, a methionine adenosyltransferase that produces a byproduct that also inhibits PRMT5, was identified as an additional vulnerability in MTAP-deleted cancers (PMID: 27068473).",

    "The MTOR protein is a serine-threonine kinase that coordinates cell growth, protein synthesis and metabolic signaling (PMID: 22500797, 21157483).

The two best characterized downstream targets of mTORC1, S6K and 4EBP1, dictate the rate of protein synthesis, nutrient response and many additional features required for rapid tumor growth (PMID: 15314020). Consequently, inhibition of mTORC1 has been therapeutically exploited across a variety of malignancies. mTORC2 coordinates with PDK1 to phosphorylate and activate AKT. mTORC2 is known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle progression and cellular survival (PMID: 18566586). Missense mutations of the MTOR gene occur in many tumors, notably in approximately 6% of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, 7.5% of lung adenocarcinomas, 5% of endometrial carcinomas and 4% of colon and rectal carcinomas (PMID: 24132290). Furthermore, various mTOR mutations have been characterized that cause increased MTOR pathway activation and increased sensitivity to rapamycin (PMID: 24631838, 24625776). Several case reports in the literature have reported extreme durable responses to rapamycin-analogue (rapalogue) therapies in patients with heavily pre-treated metastatic cancer and activating mTOR mutations (PMID: 24622468, 24625776).

Unlike MYC, which is expressed ubiquitously, MYCL is preferentially expressed in the developing kidney and lung (PMID: 8657155), and appears to be less potent in terms of transformation potential (PMID: 2457153). Reports of cancer-associated genomic alterations of MYCL are predominantly limited to small cell lung carcinomas, where MYCL is found amplified in approximately 5-10% of samples (PMID: 2997622, 1327035). Amplification of other MYC family members also occurs in small cell lung cancer, and in some cases these amplifications may co-occur with amplifications of MYCL (PMID: 10378696, 1327035).",

    ". While the majority of research focuses on MYCN in neuroblastoma, MYCN amplification or overexpression has been shown to contribute to tumorigenesis in various other cancer types (PMID: 22139329, 22035742, 21533284, 16116477)",
    "(PMID: 22139329, 22035742, 21533284, 16116477).",
    "MYCN is a MYC-family transcription factor with high homology to the commonly amplified transcription factor c-MYC (encoded by the gene MYC) (PMID: 20399964). MYCN has been shown to function both as a transcriptional activator and repressor, regulating the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism and regulation of the tumor microenvironment, among other processes (PMID: 16934487, 20399964). The MYCN gene is organized into an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain and a C-terminal basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper DNA-binding domain. Unlike c-MYC, which is ubiquitously expressed, expression of n-MYC is temporally restricted to embryonic development and spatially restricted to cells of the nervous system, kidney, lung and spleen. Amplification of MYCN is predominantly associated with cancers of neural origin (e.g. neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, glioblastoma), but has been observed in other solid tumors including prostate, breast and small cell lung cancers (PMID: 24589438, 16934487, 15013217). Targeting MYCN directly has been challenging, and therefore therapeutic strategies have focused on targeting MYCN downstream targets, factors involved in MYCN transcriptional activity or MYCN stability (PMID: 24857145, 24086065).",

    "MYD88 encodes for the signaling adaptor protein Myeloid differentiation primary response 88. It functions to transduce signaling from Toll-like receptors and the Interleukin-1 receptor important for innate immunity (PMID: 16413925, 12467250, 11544529). Signaling through MYD88 activates the NFkB pathway (PMID: 9734363). Patients with MYD88 loss of function mutations are more susceptible to bacterial infections due to immune dysfunction (PMID: 18669862). Activating mutations of MYD88, particularly the L265P mutation, are frequently identified in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia patients (PMID: 22931316). The same mutation is also found in lymphomas, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the Activated B-cell type Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas (DLBCL) (PMID: 21179087, 22150006)",
    "Truncating mutations of MYH11 can occur throughout the gene and typically result in loss of protein function. These mutations have been identified in colorectal cancer and prostate cancer (PMID: 29517504)",
    ". In vitro studies with MSI colorectal cancer cell lines expressing MYH11 frameshift mutations demonstrate that truncating mutations are inactivating as measured by loss of ATPase regulation compared to wildtype (PMID: 18796164, 29517504)",
    "MYH11 is a smooth muscle myosin protein belonging to the myosin heavy chain family (PMID: 32382337). MYH11 functions as a contractile protein involved in inducing muscle contraction via ATP hydrolysis, but may also be able to regulate gene expression patterns of the cell by binding DNA as a transcription factor (PMID: 34380460). Pathogenic germline alterations in MYH11 predispose to familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection (TAAD), and individuals with these mutations show smooth muscle cell disarray and hyperplasia (PMID: 17666408). Meanwhile, in vitro overexpression of MYH11 inhibits cell migration, proliferation and invasion suggesting it acts as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 34380460). Inversion of chromosome 16 can result in the CBFB-MYH11 fusion, which is found in the M4 type of acute myeloid leukemia with associated eosinophilia (PMID: 23160462). This fusion protein disrupts the CBF complex and results in a block in proper hematopoiesis (PMID: 20007544).",
    "MYOD1 deletion mutations typically result in the loss of protein expression. In vitro studies with MYOD1-knockout myoblast cells demonstrate that loss of MYOD1 is inactivating as measured by resistance to apoptosis and increased cellular proliferation compared to wildtype (PMID: 17940048)",
    "MYOD1 is a transcription factor that is a member of the bHLH protein family. MYOD1, together with the closely related regulatory transcription factors MYF5, MRF4 and MYOGENIN, control myogenic differentiation. MYOD1 commits mesoderm cells to a skeletal myoblast lineage, regulates their continued state and can also regulate muscle repair (PMID: 16099183). MYOD1 removes cells from the cell cycle by increasing the transcription of p21 and myogenin, which is important for the switch from cellular proliferation to differentiation. Loss of this control can lead to the formation of rhabdomyosarcoma (PMID: 16099183, 12783965). MYOD1 is infrequently mutated in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (PMID: 25295632, 24824843, 24793135, 24272621).",
    "The NADK I90F mutation is found in the N-terminal domain of the protein.

    ". Structural modeling of this alteration demonstrated that the NADK I90F mutation may increase the dimer interface of the protein, which likely contrinutes to enhanced substrate availability and kinase activity (PMID: 26806015)",
    "NADK is a kinase involved in the regulation of several metabolic and biosynthetic pathways (PMID: 27582489, 21526340, 17855339). NADK is localized to the cytoplasm and catalyzes the phosphorylation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADP+ (PMID: 27582489, 21526340, 17855339). NADK-dependent phosphorylation requires ATP and magnesium cofactors for this conversion (PMID: 21526340, 17855339). NADP+ is then reduced to NADPH by dehydrogenases, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and malic enzymes (PMID: 27582489, 21526340). NADPH is an important cofactor involved in several protein, nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis pathways (PMID: 27582489). Proliferating cancer cells are increasingly dependent on these biosynthetic pathways during growth (PMID: 27582489). In addition, NADPH is necessary for maintenance of the cellular redox state and neutralizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) during cancer cell proliferation (PMID: 22550069, 18020963). Additional roles of NADPH include antioxidant host defense and regulation of glucose-mediated insulin secretion (PMID: 22550069). Somatic gain-of-function mutations in NADK have been identified in patients with pancreatic and colorectal cancer (PMID: 28954733, 26806015). Overexpression of NADK has also been found in patients with various cancers, suggesting that NADK may predominantly function as an oncogene (PMID: 27582489). Suppression of the NADPH pool has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy in cancer patients (PMID: 26219913).",
    "NBN truncating mutations are predicted to result in a mutant NBN protein that lacks the forkhead-associated and BCRT domains and can therefore no longer bind to and repair DNA double-stranded breaks. These mutations are found in the germline of patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome which is characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition (PMID: 9590180)",

    "NBN is a component of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs (MRN) complex involved in DNA double-strand break sensing and repair (PMID: 9590181). The complex activates the kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM- and RAD3-related) to initiate DNA damage response and is itself phosphorylated by ATM (PMID: 23525106, 23582259, 26512707, 10802669). The complex has DNA nuclease activity important for stimulating repair (PMID: 18854157). Activation of the MRN complex enables the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint response to DNA damage (PMID: 14657032). The complex is also important for genomic integrity at telomeres, replication forks, immunoglobulin gene loci during rearrangements and DNA breaks formed in meiosis (PMID: 19667071, 21565612, 16285919, 17291760). Activation of repair mechanisms includes non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair (PMID: 12422221, 24316220). Germline NBN mutations are associated with the Nijmegen breakage syndrome, characterized by increased cancer incidence, microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency and sensitivity to ionizing radiation (PMID: 9590180, 9590181). Mutations have been found in cholangiocarcinoma, liver, prostate cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, medulloblastoma and other cancers (PMID: 24349281, 22864661, 21923652, 18593981, 18056440). Mutations and copy number alterations in NBN may lead to susceptibility to radiation and specific inhibitors related to DNA damage including Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibitors (PMID: 22396666, 25324139, 25415046, 24240112).",
    "NCOA3 (also known as pCIP, SRC3) is a nuclear receptor co-activator involved in the regulation of transcription. It interacts with nuclear hormone receptors to enhance transcription (PMID: 23850489, 15383283). NCOA3 has histone acetyltransferase activity and can recruit other histone acetyltransferase enzymes to the complex (PMID: 9296499, 9192892). It acts to regulate pluripotency in stem cells, mammary gland development and response to TNF alpha (PMID: 10823921, 23019124, 15383283). It is expressed in various cancer cells and affects processes including cancer metabolism, anti-apoptosis, and cell growth (PMID: 24584933, 23388826, 20663904). Its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in various tumor types including gastric and non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 25970779, 20064830). The gene has been found to be amplified in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer (PMID: 9252329, 22371647). Inhibitors of NCOA3 are in development for anti-tumor therapy (PMID: 24743578, 24390736).",
    "NCOR1 is a tumor suppressor and truncating mutations in this gene are assumed to be oncogenic. In breast cancer, NCOR1 acts as a co-repressor and recruitment to DNA is necessary for ligand-dependent transcriptional repression by estrogen receptor (ER) (PMID: 21102521)",
    ". A similar feature is seen with thyroid-hormone receptors and retinoic acid receptors, although the ability of NCOR1 to repress transcription in this setting is ligand-independent (PMID: 7566114)",
    "NCOR1 is a nuclear transcriptional co-repressor that represses transcription mainly by recruiting histone deacetylase HDAC3 to DNA promoter regions (PMID: 20084085). Physiologically, NCOR1 is involved in the control of metabolism and inflammation as well as embryonal development (PMID: 20084085). NCOR1 is involved in the regulation of S-phase progression and genomic stability. It does so by maintaining acetylation and methylation patterns during S phase, which are essential for DNA repair and genomic stability (PMID: 21075309). NCOR1 has previously been linked to several kinds of cancers such as leukemia, glioblastoma multiforme, colorectal as well as endometrial carcinoma and prostate cancer (PMID: 17190815, 17630505, 17694085, 17312396, 19414341, 19269830, 12441355, 16373395, 22695118). Some leukemias are caused by translocation events that pair co-repressor-interacting proteins with proteins that are not regulated by NCOR1. This results in aberrant gene repression, which in some cases can be overcome by HDAC inhibitors (PMID: 9462740). NCOR is dramatically increased in glioblastoma multiforme, which correlates with de-differentiated phenotype and progression of the tumors (PMID: 16479164, 16534112). In these cases, preclinical evidence has shown that inhibition of the NCOR1 pathway can be achieved by simultaneous administration of Retinoic Acid and the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitors which led to dramatic increase in differentiation and inhibition (PMID: 17312396).",
    "NCOR2 (also SMRT) is a nuclear hormone transcriptional co-repressor that is a member of the NCOR protein family (PMID: 20084085). NCOR2 represses transcription mainly by recruiting the histone deacetylase HDAC3 to DNA promoter regions (PMID: 20084085, 11509652). Histone deacetylases predominantly function to add repressive marks to chromatin, resulting in chromatin compaction and reduced gene expression (PMID: 17694085). NCOR2 is homologous to NCOR1 and both corepressors bind similar substrates, namely the HDAC3 complex, which includes TBL1, TBLR1 and GPS2 (PMID: 20084085). In addition, NCOR2 associates with additional DNA binding proteins that regulate actin binding, kinase inhibition, histone binding and scaffolding, p53-dependent DNA damage and ubiquitination (PMID: 20084085). While NCOR1 and NCOR2 have some overlapping functions, non-redundant upstream kinases regulate their activation and differential expression patterns contribute to their context-specificity (PMID: 15491994, 17928865). In addition, NCOR2 preferentially regulates the activity of the retinoic acid receptor (PMID: 11435607). In addition, NCOR2 has been implicated in the regulation of neural stem cell proliferation, lineage commitment, metabolism, and inflammation (PMID: 19066220). Somatic mutations in NCOR2 are rare; however, aberrant NCOR2 activity is predicted to aberrantly regulate histone deacetylation and gene repression in human cancers (PMID: 17694085). In leukemias, NCOR2 mediates the binding of fusion proteins to DNA, such as PML/RARα, to coordinate gene regulation (PMID: 15729358). Additional mutations in NCOR2 binding partners lead to abnormal NCOR2/HDAC3 activity in cancers; however, NCOR2 mutations have not been extensively characterized (PMID: 27733359).",
    "NCSTN is a protease that serves as an essential component of the gamma-secretase complex (PMID: 25565961). NCSTN catalyzes the cleavage of membrane proteins, including Notch receptors 1-4, in order to release a processed intracellular NOTCH domain that can then activate gene expression in the nucleus (PMID: 22547652). The NOTCH signaling pathway regulates various aspects of cell differentiation, growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism (PMID: 27507209). Deletion of NCSTN in the hematopoietic system in murine models results in increased numbers of thymic dendritic cells and T regulatory cells, implicating NCSTN in immune homeostasis (PMID: 22547652). In addition, NCSTN functions as a protease in other contexts, including in the cleavage of APP (amyloid-beta precursor protein) into amyloid-beta peptides, which compose plaques in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients (PMID: 12297508). Germline and somatic NCSTN alterations have been identified in patients with Alzheimer’s disease as well as in dermatological disorders (PMID: 11992262, 12419494, 25211177, 26224166). Somatic mutations in NCSTN are rare in human cancers; however, amplifications in NCSTN may lead to increased NOTCH signaling (PMID: 26109346, 2018). Inhibitors targeting gamma-secretase are currently in clinical trials and may have activity in patients with aberrant NCSTN activity (PMID: 28539479).",
    "NEGR1 is a cell adhesion protein that is primarily localized to cell membrane rafts, especially in regions of cell-to-cell contact. NEGR1 is extracellularly tethered to the membrane using a specialized lipid moiety termed a GPI-anchor. NEGR1 and other GPI-anchored proteins are highly enriched in lipid raft domains and are involved in a number of important cellular activities including signaling processes and cell adhesion (PMID: 12440695). Genetic alterations of NEGR1 have been implicated in human obesity and dyslexia (PMID: 19079261). NEGR1 is downregulated in several cancers types (PMID: 21624008) and reintroduction of NEGR1 into a human cancer cell line results in reduced cell proliferation (PMID: 21624008, 25057311). These data suggest that NEGR1 functions as a putative tumor suppressor, however, pro-tumorigenic roles have been assigned to NEGR1 in the maintenance of tumorigenic activity in metastatic breast cancer cells (PMID: 24648515). In addition, a study aimed at identifying protein biomarkers in urine for early detection of invasive breast cancer found NEGR1 as a protein that was significantly upregulated in patients with metastatic breast cancer compared to the normal control subjects (PMID: 26544852).",

    "The NF1 gene encodes a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPases HRAS, KRAS and NRAS (PMID: 2121370, 1946382). When bound to RAS, the NF1 protein stabilizes the GTPase activity of the RAS proteins, which switches RAS from its active, GTP-bound state to its inactive, GDP-bound state (PMID: 9219684, 9302992). The GAP-related domain (GRD) is the catalytic domain of NF1, which is directly responsible for its GAP activity but only encompasses approximately 10% of the protein. NF1 is congenitally altered in the cancer-predisposing syndrome Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and is somatically altered in many tumor types including breast cancer, melanoma, and glioma (PMID: 2134734, 1946382, 18772890, 23000897, 9639526, 18948947, 22817889). Inactivation of NF1 due to gene deletion, gene mutation, or protein degradation results in elevated levels of active, GTP-bound RAS and activation of downstream pathways such as the MAPK/ERK pathway and the PI3K pathway (PMID: 19573811, 24576830, 8563751, 7542586, 8052307, 12509763). Missense and truncating mutations occur across the entire gene and do not localize to hotspots. Alterations occurring on one allele of NF1 likely lead to haploinsufficiency of the protein (PMID: 7920653, 18089636) as many patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 have an unaltered second allele despite exhibiting symptoms of the syndrome. Additionally, functional loss of heterozygosity likely occurs on the second NF1 allele, as tumors with NF1 point mutations have lower levels of mRNA than wildtype tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, May 2015).",

    "NF2, also known as Merlin, is a membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding protein that is expressed predominantly in nervous tissues (PMID: 25893302). NF2 is important in indirectly linking actin-transmembrane receptors and intracellular effectors to modulate signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and survival. These include downstream signaling pathways of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), cell adhesion, small GTPases, mTOR, PI3K/Akt and hippo pathways (PMID: 20491622). NF2 is a tumor suppressor. Germline inactivation of NF2 by mutation or deletion results in the autosomal dominant tumor syndrome Neurofibromatosis Type 2, which is associated with the development of benign central nervous system (CNS) tumors such as vestibular schwannomas (PMID: 7911002). NF2 is found to be somatically mutated in other types of cancers.",
    "The NFE2 Q7Tfs* mutation is located in the transactivating domain of the protein. This mutation has been found in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 30755419)",
    ". This mutation abolishes expression of the full-length NFE2 protein and instead allows for expression of a shorter, 350-amino acid isoform. Expression of this mutation in CB3 cells demonstrated that this mutation is likely activating as measured by increased transcriptional activity compared to wildtype NFE2 (PMID: 30755419)",
    "NFE2 is a transcription factor that regulates erythroid and megakaryocytic gene expression (PMID: 11154691, 8469283). The NFE2 transcription factor complex consists of two subunits: p45, a hematopoietic-specific subunit and the smaller Maf protein subunit, which is more ubiquitously expressed (PMID: 11154691). NFE2, in collaboration with the chromatin regulatory protein CBP, binds erythroid and megakaryocytic promoters to regulate gene expression and epigenetic state (PMID: 11154691). In addition, NFE2 co-binds with the transcription factor AP-1 to modulate the expression of the erythroid globin genes (PMID: 12920035). NFE2 expression is regulated by JAK2 in myeloproliferative neoplasms, a malignancy that is dependent on JAK-STAT pathway activity (PMID: 29519804). Overexpression of NFE2 results in leukemic transformation in murine models, likely due to the upregulation of a chronic inflammatory response and subsequent clonal evolution (PMID: 23932394, 22231305). Somatic NFE2 mutations in human cancers are rare; however, NFE2 is overexpressed in myeloproliferative neoplasms and polycythemias (PMID: 16572198, 24297870). In addition, rare truncating gain-of-function mutations have been identified in myeloproliferative neoplasms (PMID: 23589569), suggesting the NFE2 predominantly functions as an oncogene.",
    "NFE2L2 (Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2), also known as NRF2, is a transcription factor that is important in activating antioxidant proteins to protect against certain environmental and oxidative stresses (PMID: 16968214). Under normal cellular conditions, the interaction of NRF2 with KEAP1 retains the protein in the cytoplasm and promotes its proteasomal degradation via ubiquitination (PMID: 9887101). Upon sensing stress signals, KEAP1 undergoes a conformational change, preventing it from interacting with NRF2 and allowing NRF2 to translocate to the nucleus and drive the expression of specific genes (PMID: 12359864). NRF2 can have a protective role in cancer formation from certain chemical carcinogens (PMID: 11248092). However, chronic activation of NRF2 can also support the development of chemo- and radio-resistance (PMID: 24142871). Tumor-associated NRF2 activation can result from inactivation of KEAP1 through mutation, loss of heterozygosity or epigenetic silencing (PMID: 19321346). NRF2 activation can also arise directly from mutations in NFE2L2 in the KEAP1-binding domains (PMID: 18757741, 19967722).",

    "NFκBIα (NF-κB inhibitor α) is a protein that represses signaling of NF-κB, a family of transcription factors activated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. NFκBIα helps keep NFκB in an inactive state by supporting its interaction with inhibitory molecules in the cell cytoplasm. A range of external stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors or stress, can lead to phosphorylation of NFκBIα and subsequently the release and nuclear translocation of NFκB; this results in the transcriptional activation of hundreds of genes that regulate the immune response, protect against apoptosis and signaling pathways critical to the formation of ectodermal tissues. Lack of NFκB is often due to loss-of-function mutations (small insertions, deletions, or missense) in one allele of NFκBIα coupled with deletion or inactivation of the second allele (PMID: 9572494). Constitutive expression of NF-κB signaling results in overexpression of several target genes encoding anti-apoptotic proteins and growth-promoting proteins (PMID: 11313274). Deletion of NFκBIA has demonstrated an effect similar to EGFR amplification in glioblastomas (GBM) and is associated with relatively reduced survival (PMID: 21175304). Further, enrichment of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations in NFκBIA have been observed in Hodgkin’s lymphoma (PMID: 10023670, 19507254), colorectal cancer (PMID: 17354114), melanoma (PMID: 17492467), hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 19797428), breast cancer (PMID: 16959974) and multiple myeloma (PMID: 16540234).",

    "NKX2-1 is a homeobox-containing transcription factor essential for the development of the lung, thyroid and ventral forebrain (PMID: 16405855). Expression of NKX2-1 is restricted to specific cell types in these lineages and NKX2-1 has a role in the regulation of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. In the lung, NKX2-1 is a critical regulator of the expression of surfactants, which are proteins important for reducing surface tension in the lung and play a critical role in host defense against infection and inflammation (PMID: 15173172). Thyroid precursor cells express NKX2-1 in order to regulate thyroid-specific genes and maintenance of NKX2-1 expression is important in adult tissues for the regulation of thyroid hormones (PMID: 25350068). In thyroid carcinomas, NKX2-1 is primarily expressed in follicular neoplasm and papillary carcinoma but not in anaplastic carcinoma (PMID: 12023581). Germline mutations in NKX2-1 have been identified in families affected by multinodular goiter and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PMID: 19176457). In lung adenocarcinoma, somatic mutations of NKX2-1 are rare but sustained expression of NKX2-1 is frequently associated with gene amplification (PMID: 17925434, 18212743, 17616654, 17982442). Loss of NKX2-1 expression is also associated with favorable prognosis and reduced metastasis in murine models and humans (PMID: 21471965, 23125078), likely due to altered differentiation programs controlled by NKX2-1 (PMID: 23523371). Rearrangements of NKX2-1 with T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin heavy chain loci have also been identified in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 21481790).",

    "The NRAS gene encodes a membrane-associated GTPase that controls intracellular oncogenic MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways. Activating NRAS mutations lock the enzyme in an active state causing increased cellular proliferation via hyperactivating these downstream pathways (PMID: 20194776, 21993244). NRAS mutations are common in thyroid cancer, ovarian cancers, melanoma and hematological cancers (PMID: 21993244, 22589270, 24651010). NRAS is also important during development with germline mutations enhancing stimulus-dependent MAPK activation and accounting for some cases of Noonan syndrome (PMID: 19966803). NRAS mutations and upregulation can also provide resistance to cancer therapies, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and BRAF inhibitors (PMID: 22389471, 20619739, 25110411, 24024839).",

    "NRG1 is a cell adhesion protein that is a member of the neuregulin protein family (PMID: 18478032, 25501131). The NRG1 gene encodes six types of proteins with distinct N-terminal domains and at least 31 different isoforms, which all contain an EGF-binding domain (PMID: 18478032, 11042203). NRG1 growth factors are predominantly synthesized as membrane-bound proteins that are cleaved and released into the extracellular space; however, type III NRG1 isoforms have transmembrane and intracellular activities (PMID: 18478032, 9789034). NRG1 functions as a ligand for the HER receptor tyrosine kinases, with specificity for HER3 and HER4 (PMID: 11042203, 17250808). Binding of NRG1 via the EGF-domain initiates HER dimerization, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways including the MAPK and PI3K pathways (PMID: 18478032, 25501131). NRG1-mediated signaling regulates a variety of cellular functions including neuronal survival, migration, differentiation, and cellular proliferation, among others (PMID: 12821646, 18478032, 25501131). The expression and processing of the differential NRG1 proteins are highly cell-type specific, leading to the activation of specialized cellular programs (PMID: 27989735, 24237343). Germline NRG1 variants are found in developmental disorders and schizophrenia (PMID: 30180823, 30180823). Overexpression of NRG1 has been implicated in tumor progression in a variety of cancer types including ovarian cancer and gastric cancer, among others (PMID: 20227043, 28573357). NRG1 rearrangements are also found in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, resulting in increased NRG1 expression, suggesting that NRG1 functions as an oncogene (PMID: 25501131, 24469108, 27626312, 29802158).",

    ". Restoration of NSD1 function in glioma and neuroblastoma cells lacking NSD1 leads to a reduction in colony formation and cell proliferation (PMID: 20018718)",
    "NSD1 is a ligand-regulated nuclear transcription factor that is activated by steroid hormones (PMID: 11733144). NSD1 has a unique role as a bifunctional cofactor that can both positively and negatively regulate transcription (PMID: 12805229, 9628876, 11733144). Additionally, NSD1 recognizes histone lysines and contains histone methyltransferase activity with specificity for H3K36 and H4K20 (PMID: 12805229, 21972110). H3K36 methylation is most commonly associated with activation of gene transcription, but may also affect other processes such as DNA repair or RNA splicing (PMID: 22266761). Germline mutations of NSD1 are associated with Sotos syndrome, characterized by overgrowth, distinctive appearance, and developmental delay (PMID: 11896389). Translocations involving NSD1 and the NUP98 gene are highly prevalent in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and are associated with a poor prognosis (PMID: 11895789, 23630019). Loss-of-function NSD1 mutations have also been identified in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and leukemias (PMID: 25631445, 26438511, 25056374, 22976956). NUP98-NSD1 fusions and NSD1 loss-of-function mutations result in global genomic histone methylation changes leading to altered gene expression (PMID: 17589499, 26690673, 28067913).",

    "The NSD2 gene encodes the NSD2 histone lysine methyltransferase. NSD2 specifically methylates the H3K36 residue of histones and promotes an open chromatin state that favors gene transcription (PMID: 22099308, 20974671, 19808676). Activation of NSD2 enhances an oncogenic H3K36me2-dependent transcriptional program that includes genes such as MET, PAK1 and PRKCA, and activates tumorigenesis in in vitro and in vivo cancer models (PMID: 19808676, 24076604, 37463241). NSD2 is mutated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Mantle cell lymphoma (PMID: 24076604, 24145436).",

Nature Medicine, 2017. http://doi:10.1038/nm.4333). The amplification is associated with increased expression levels in cancer cell lines and its depletion correlated with decreased cellular proliferation (PMID: 24874471, 18757432, 21664949)",
    "(PMID: 24874471, 18757432, 21664949). Assuming the amplification is associated with increased protein levels this suggest a putative oncogenic role for NSD3 amplification, although this has not been directly described.",

    "The NSD3 gene encodes the NSD3 histone lysine methyltransferase. NSD3 methylates both the H3K4 residue, which constitutes an epigenetic mark for transcriptional activation, and the H3K27 residue, which acts as a repressive mark (PMID: 16682010). Thus, it is controversial whether this gene acts as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor (PMID: 20599755). NSD3 is altered by amplification in a subset of various cancers, including breast and lung tumors (PMID: 20940404, 25942451, 2016).",
    "The NT5C2 R39Q mutation lies in a positively charged pocket at the interface of the tightly associated dimer. This mutation has been found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) following treatment with 6-mercaptopurine (PMID: 30910786)",
    ". The mutation is likely activating as demonstrated by increased 5'-nucleotidase activity of recombinant protein expressing the mutation compared to wildtype NT5C2 (PMID: 29990496, 30910786)",
    ". Crystallization, structural modeling, and biochemical characterization of this mutant protein demonstrate that it is activating as it disrupts a regulatory switch responsible for NT5C2 self-inactivation (PMID: 30910786)",
    "NT5C2 (also CN-II) is a 5’ nucleotidase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of nucleotides (PMID: 29990496, 30201983). Activity of NT5C2 is important for the maintenance of nucleotide pools and the export of excess purine nucleotides out of the cell (PMID: 29990496). NT5C2 functions as a dimer of dimers to dephosphorylate purine substrates including inosine monophosphate (IMP), xanthine monophosphate (XMP), and guanosine monophosphate (GMP), resulting in the clearance of purine nucleosides (PMID: 30201983). Nucleotide analog chemotherapies that disrupt DNA synthesis, such as cytarabine and thiopurines, are also targets of dephosphorylation by NT5C2, ultimately leading to their inactivation (PMID: 30201983). High expression of NT5C2 in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia correlates with drug resistance and poor outcome (PMID: 16330448, 17350683, 26294725). Activating NT5C2 mutations are found in patients with hematopoietic malignancies, including childhood and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and B-lymphoblastic leukemia, predominantly after relapse to nucleotide analog chemotherapies (PMID: 29990496, 23377183, 23377281, 25790293, 28253933). Gain-of-function NT5C2 mutations can activate NT5C2 by several distinct mechanisms: locking the enzymatic complex in an activate state, disrupting the NT5C2 off-switch, or loss of the negative regulation at the C-terminal (PMID: 29535428, 29990496). Germline NT5C2 variants have also been linked to relapse in hematopoietic and non-small cell lung cancers (PMID: 30201983, 22173087, 28573946). Expression of activating NT5C2 mutations in murine models results in impaired leukemia growth and tumor-initiating capacity due to the excessive export of purines, suggesting that NT5C2 functions as an oncogene at relapse but not at tumor initiation (PMID: 29342136). In preclinical studies, NT5C2-mutant leukemia cells were sensitive to blocking guanosine synthesis by inhibiting inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) (PMID: 29342136).",

NTHL1 localizes in the nucleus, where it catalyzes the N-glycosylation of damaged DNA and subsequent cleavage of the resulting modified bond, constituting the first steps towards DNA repair in the base excision repair (BER) pathway (PMID: 10882850, 18166975, 21930793, 9890904, 17923696). Low NTHL1 expression has been associated with a decreased capacity for DNA repair in gastric cancer (PMID: 19414504). However, a dual role for NTHL1 has been described in irradiated cells; it both repairs potentially lethal DNA lesions and generates lethal double-strand breaks at radiation-induced sites (PMID: 16111924). NTHL1 interacts with PCNA and p53 proteins (PMID: 15358233). Germline truncating mutations of NTHL1 have been identified as the causal alteration in families with hereditary colorectal tumors and other neoplasias (PMID: 25938944, 26559593). Paradoxically, NTHL1 is somatically amplified in a subset of breast and pancreatic tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).",

Activation of NTRK3 leads to autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of a downstream signaling pathway controlling cell proliferation, survival and differentiation via MAPK, PI3K and PLC-γ (PMID: 10851172). NTRK3 has been found altered, mainly in the form of oncogenic fusions, in several human cancers (PMID: 9462753, 11801301, 10895816, 12450792, 9823307, 25207766, 21401966, 24327398, 24135138, 23583981, 24705251).

    "NUP214 is a nucleoporin found on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (PMID: 8108440). NUP214, a phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeat-containing nucleoporin, is responsible for nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins and mRNA across the nuclear envelope in conjunction with NUP88 and the nuclear export receptor XPO1 (PMID: 7878057, 9488438, 8896451, 16943420). The FG-repeat of NUP214 is a disordered domain that contributes to selective transport while also acting as a selective barrier to specific proteins and RNAs, and mutations that alter this domain affect the movement of molecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (PMID: 16769882). Because NUP214 regulates the proteins and mRNA that cross the nuclear envelope, it plays a role in the regulation of cell cycle, mitosis and gene expression (PMID: 30669574, 9488438). NUP214 fusions such as SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214, which may arise de novo or due to prior treatment, have been identified in liquid tumors such as AML and ALL (PMID: 30669574) and are associated with disease that is characterized as more aggressive, with poor prognosis, higher risk of relapse, etc. (PMID: 24441146, 16628187, 30669574).",

    "NUP93 is a subunit of the nuclear pore complex that is essential for the exchange of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope (PMID: 24572986). NUP93 activity promotes and maintains the correct assembly of the nuclear pore complex (PMID: 15229283, 22171326). Functional studies have suggested that NUP93 plays a role in gene regulation by tethering chromatin at superenhancer sites to generate the necessary structural environment for transcriptional repression or activation (PMID: 26341556, 27807035). Expression of NUP93, along with other members of the nucleoporin complex, is increased in cardiac tissue of patients with heart failure and decreased in the thymus of patients with Down syndrome (PMID: 23152829, 21856934). While NUP93 copy number alterations are observed in a variety of solid cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov. 2017), NUP93 mutations in human cancers are not common.

    "NUTM1 encodes the nuclear protein in testis (NUT), which is expressed in normal spermatocytes. NUTM1 is a novel gene located on chromosome 15; not much is known about its function, except that the protein harbors an acidic binding domain for the acetyltransferase p300 (PMID: 20676058). Most of the current knowledge on NUTM1 is focused on alterations involved in cancer (PMID: 17934517). More specifically, chromosomal translocations involving NUT and BRD proteins—in particular BRD4, but also BRD3—are found in NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), a rare, aggressive, and lethal genetically defined epithelial cancer syndrome, characterized by the insurgence of carcinomas in various tissues along the upper midline of the body, that mainly affects young individuals (PMID: 17934517, 26551281, 24655834, 12543779, 25675182). Approximately 75% of NMC cases feature BRD4-NUT translocation, where the fusion oncogene is expressed under the BRD4 promoter and consists of the first half of the BRD4 protein (which contains all of the functional domain of BRD4) and all of the coding region of NUT. Translocation leading to the fusion protein BRD3-NUT is less common. A novel translocation that results in the fusion protein NSD3-NUT has been observed in NMC of the lung (PMID: 25466466). In a small number of cases involving NUT rearrangements, called NUT variants, the partner of the translocation is unknown. These NUT variants are associated with longer survival, compared with BRD4-NUT carcinomas (PMID: 15483023). NUT rearrangements are found in 18% of cases of undifferentiated carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract (PMID: 18391746).

GPCRs signal by association with heterotrimeric G proteins at the plasma membrane and function as exchange factors leading to G-protein activation (PMID: 30262890). P2RY8 signals via the G-protein GNA13 and the downstream effector ARHGEF1, leading to activation of signaling pathways (PMID: 26573295). P2RY8 is highly expressed in germinal center B cells; functional studies in murine B cells demonstrate that P2RY8 suppresses B cell growth and mediates B cell positioning in the germinal center in a GNA13-dependent manner (PMID: 25274307, 26573295). In addition, P2RY8 is required to promote the clustering of activated B cells within follicles in collaboration with follicular dendritic cells (PMID: 26573295). P2RY8 fusions are found in patients with B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and ALL-associated Down Syndrome (PMID: 19838194).

    "PAK5 (also PAK7) is a serine/threonine kinase and member of the PAK family of proteins, which function as downstream effectors of Rho GTPases (PMID: 24869804). PAK5 is predominantly expressed in neuronal cell types and functions as a target of the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and RAC (PMID: 11756552, 12860998). Cdc42 cycles between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state, in which PAK5 binds activated Cdc42 to initiate downstream signaling pathways (PMID: 24869804). PAK5 mediates a variety of cellular functions including regulation of MAPK and JNK signaling, as well as cell motility and survival (PMID: 12032833, 11756552, 18199048), apoptosis via phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD (PMID: 12897128, 20567954), and cytoskeletal stability (PMID: 16014608, 20564219). In neuronal cell types, PAK5 is predominantly localized in the mitochondria (PMID: 12897128) and expression of PAK5 leads to the induction of neurite formation via downstream activity of Cdc42 and Rac (PMID: 11756552, 15322108). Loss of PAK5 expression in mice results in defects in memory and learning and variants in PAK5 have been associated with the risk of psychosis in humans (PMID: 24474471). PAK5 overexpression has been identified in a variety of human tumor types including lung cancer, gastric cancer and melanoma, among others (PMID: 19415746, 16845324, 20564219, 23685956, 23106939, 25052921, 26116538). Expression of PAK5 in preclinical studies has been associated with increased invasion and migration and cellular protection from apoptosis (PMID: 25726523, 19415746, 20567954).

    "PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2, also known as FANCN) encodes a DNA-repair factor and BRCA2 binding protein (PMID: 16793542). PALB2 acts as a scaffold protein in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, likely mediating recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 at damaged loci (PMID: 19423707). PALB2 also interacts with BRCA1, possibly functioning as an intermediary factor between BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the HR pathway (PMID: 19268590, 19584259). Preclinical data show that mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 can abrogate interaction with PALB2 and disrupt HR-mediated DNA repair (PMID: 19369211, 16793542). Germline biallelic mutations of PALB2 are linked to the hereditary disease Fanconi Anemia, which predisposes to various cancers (PMID: 20858716, 17200671, 17200672).

    "PARP1 encodes a nuclear localized poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase that transfers an ADP-ribose group to target proteins. PARP1 activity has been implicated in several biological processes including DNA repair, DNA replication, transcription, and chromatin remodeling (PMID: 9315851, 26184161). After induction of DNA damage, PARP1 binds to sites of single-strand breaks and recruits DNA repair proteins to the site of damage (PMID: 9315851, 26184161). PARP1 is also a key factor in regulating other biological and oncogenic processes, including maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic development, cell reprogramming and transcriptional regulation (PMID: 17286852, 22902501, 23939864, 21095583, 19262751, 26184161). Functional studies have demonstrated that PARP1 loss leads to genomic instability and resistance to DNA damage-induced cell death (PMID: 24916104). PARP1 is highly expressed in several human cancers, however, PARP1 mutations are rare (PMID: 25528020). In the absence of PARP1, single-strand breaks cause replication fork collapse resulting in double-stranded breaks and ultimately triggering DNA repair by homologous recombination pathways involving DNA repair genes such as BRCA1/2 (PMID: 24916104, 25286972). PARP1 inhibitors have been developed to leverage the ability of PARP1 to induce double-strand breaks in cancers with mutations in DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1/2, resulting in inefficient repair and cell death (PMID: 15829967, 19351835, 20858840, 25286972). PARP inhibitors have also been shown to be efficacious in other tumor types that share clinicopathological characteristics with BRCA-mutant tumors (‘BRCAness’), such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and ovarian serous papillary carcinoma (PMID: 16912188).

    "PAX3, a member of the paired-box (PAX) family, encodes for a transcription factor that regulates expression of target genes involved in cellular proliferation, survival and differentiation (PMID: 22532290). All PAX proteins contain a paired box DNA-binding domain, a homeobox DNA-binding domain and a transactivation domain (PMID: 24496612). The expression of PAX genes is temporally and spatially restricted during organogenesis and these genes play a key role in controlling cell fate during early development (PMID: 24496612). There are seven human isoforms of PAX3, with each isoform regulating intersecting target genes (PMID: 17187370). Knockdown of PAX3 in melanoma, glioblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell models suppresses cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that PAX3 functions predominantly as an oncogene in these contexts (PMID: 36057879, 10871843, 23701726). PAX3 chromosomal rearrangements have been identified in rhabdomyosarcoma and gastric cancer (PMID: 18457914, 25653235, 12039929).",

    "PAX5 is a protein in the paired-box family of transcription factors that is important in early B-cell development and differentiation (PMID: 10524622). PAX5 plays a key role in the commitment of bone marrow multipotent progenitors to the B-lymphoid lineage by favoring VDJ gene rearrangement and activating the expression of B-cell-specific genes (PMID: 9442394) while simultaneously repressing genes involved in other hematopoietic differentiation programs (PMID: 12479824). The oncogenic function of PAX5 is likely tissue specific. PAX5 deficiency in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and models induces leukemia development and aberrant B-cell development and differentiation, suggesting that PAX5 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene in this context (PMID: 25855603, 24939936, 30643249). Inactivating mutations, hypermethylation, translocations and deletions of PAX5 have been found in B-ALL, pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and breast cancer (PMID: 17344859, 8943844, 25855603, 19020546, 37403081). A germline susceptibility mutation in PAX5 for development of B-ALL has also been identified (PMID: 24013638). Conversely, expression of PAX5 in other cancer cell models induces increased cancer cell viability, promotion of c-Met transcription and confers cisplatin resistance, suggesting that PAX5 functions predominantly as an oncogene in these tissue contexts (PMID: 19139719, 9815975, 29964012).

    "PAX8 is a protein in the paired-box (PAX) family of transcription factors that plays a key role in controlling cell fate during early development and organogenesis (PMID: 24496612). All PAX proteins contain a paired box DNA-binding domain, a homeo box DNA-binding domain and a transactivation domain (PMID: 24496612). The expression of PAX genes is temporally and spatially restricted during organogenesis and these genes play a key role in controlling cell fate during early development (PMID: 24496612). PAX8 is the only member of the family expressed in the thyroid tissue; it is involved in thyroid follicular cell development and expression of thyroid-specific genes, and also functions in very early stages organogenesis of the kidney, the gynecologic tract and the thymus (PMID: 1337742). A fusion protein, PAX8-PPARγ, is implicated in some follicular thyroid carcinomas and follicular-variant papillary thyroid carcinomas (PMID: 10958784). An array of heterogenous mutations of PAX8 have been seen in thyroid dysgenesis, which causes congenital hypothyroidism (PMID: 25231445).",

    ". Deletion of PBRM1 and VHL in the kidney synergize to form clear cell tumors (PMID: 28329682)",
    "The PBRM1 gene encodes the protein BAF180, which is a component of the nucleosome-remodeling complex switching defective/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) (PMID: 21248752). Nucleosomes are histone octamers around which DNA is wrapped in order to regulate its exposure to transcription factors and RNA polymerases (PMID: 23113498). Remodeling complexes such as the SWI/SNF family serve to loosen, reposition and break DNA/histone contacts ultimately rendering the DNA accessible to modulation (PMID: 21654818). BAF180 contains 6 bromodomains, which bind to lysine residues in histone tails (PMID: 19084573). Aberrations of each individual bromodomain are sufficient to disrupt the protein's function as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 22435813). Specifically, one study demonstrated that BAF180 is among the key components required for p53-dependent cellular senescence (PMID: 20660729). Additional work focusing on breast cancer cell lines identified BAF180 as a critical promoter in the induction of p21 activity, which functions as a key component of cell cycle regulatory functions (PMID: 18339845). PBRM1 truncation mutants can no longer bind and remodel the p21 locus leading to cell cycle defects and aberrant cell proliferation (PMID: 18339845, 22949125). Loss of PBRM1 activity is also associated with chromosomal instability due to its inability to promote cohesion (PMID: 24613357).",
    "PCBP1 (also alpha-CP1 and HNRNP E1) is an RNA binding protein that mediates transcription, translation and alternative splicing of mRNA molecules in a variety of contexts (PMID: 17389360). PCBP1 functions as a poly(rc)-binding protein (PMID: 7607214) that binds cloverleaf and large stem-loop IV mRNA structures (PMID: 10608888). The proteins PCBP1 and PCBP2 are translated from the same intronless gene and can cooperate to regulate RNA binding in collaboration with other components, including the hnRNPK ribonucleoparticle (PMID: 7607214, 9257647, 10455157). PCBP1 has been implicated in the stability of a variety of mRNA substrates including alpha-globin (PMID: 9234743), the androgen receptor (PMID: 12011088), EPO (PMID: 10068686), p21(WAF1) (PMID: 12431987), the folate receptor (PMID: 14722620), histone molecules (PMID: 18656558) and STAT3 (PMID: 14722620), among others. PCBP1 activity regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression (PMID: 19211566), metastasis (PMID: 20154680, 26096938), and alternative splicing in both normal and malignant cells (PMID: 20361869, 27746021). For example, TGF-β activity promotes PCBP1 regulation of SMAD3, a critical mediator of metastasis (PMID: 27746021, 20154680, 26096938). Somatic mutations in PCBP1 are found in Burkitt’s lymphoma and gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and these alterations are predicted to disrupt mRNA stability and alternative splicing (PMID: 29622466, 26173642). PCBP1 regulates a diverse range of substrates implicated in oncogenesis and therefore can function as either a tumor suppressor or oncogene (PMID: 18656558).",
    "PDCD1 (Programmed cell death protein 1) encodes the protein PD1, which is a coinhibitory receptor expressed on T-cells and pro-B cells that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily (PMID: 20636820, 12421930). PD1 acts to inhibit an immune response by binding to the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed on other normal or malignant cells (PMID: 17629517). PD-L1 binding to PD1 leads to programmed cell death in antigen-specific T-cells and reduced apoptosis in regulatory T-cells, which results in an overall decrease in immune response (PMID: 11857337, 16382236, 20208540). Amplification or overexpression of PD1 has been identified in some tumor types and can be predictive of responses to immunotherapy (PMID: 22437870, 26918453, 28652380, 27620277). Antibodies targeting PD1 have been developed and assessed in clinical trials that block the immune evasive PD-L1/PD1 interaction. Atezolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (PMID: 28424325) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy (PMID: 28611199). Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, is considered first-line therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanomas that express PD-L1 and may be efficacious in other tumors that express PD-L1 (PMID: 28806116). Nivolumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody that targets PD-1, is also effective in tumors with high PD-L1 expression due to the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and activation of a robust immune response (PMID: 28806116). Tumors with defects in mismatch-repair and overexpression of PD-L1 should be considered for PD-1 blockade (PMID: 26028255).",

    "If the Amplification occur at PDCD1LG2, could lead ton Primary Mediastinal (Thymic) Large B-Cell Lymphoma",
    "The PDCD1LG2 gene encodes the \"programmed cell death 1 ligand 2\" (PD-L2) protein. PD-L2 is highly similar to PD-L1, a protein whose overexpression by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells (APC) leads to negative regulation of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and subsequent tumor immune evasion (PMID: 15599732, 22437870, 16864790). PD-L2 binding affinity for PD-1 is higher than PD-L1, although the biological consequences of this are unknown (PMID: 12893276). PD-L2 is also expressed in activated T-helper cells type 2 (Th2), inhibiting its function and regulating IFN-γ production (PMID: 21752471). Impaired tumor growth has been observed in several in vitro and in vivo cancer models upon dual PD-L1/PD-L2 inhibition, but the specific additive role for the latter remains elusive (PMID: 22611421). PDCD1LG2 overexpression or amplification has been reported in renal, cervical and breast cancers, among others, and in some cases predicts poor prognosis (PMID: 26464193, 26913631, 26424759, 26752545, 26317899, 24270737, 15837746).

    "PDGFB is a signaling ligand that is a member of the platelet-derived growth factor family (PMID: 7073684, 18483217). PDGFB encodes a precursor peptide that requires intracellular, proteolytic processing to initiate receptor binding (PMID: 16007151). Receptor binding activity of PDGFB is also dependent on ligand dimerization, either as a homodimer or a heterodimer with family member PDGFRA, to form PDGF-BB or PDGF-AB (PMID: 2836952, 18483217). PDGF dimers activate PDGF receptor kinases in a context-specific manner, dependent on ligand configuration and receptor expression (PMID: 28267575). PDGFR signaling mediates a variety of downstream signaling effectors including PI3K, MAPK, and PLC-γ, among others (PMID: 18483217). These signaling pathways regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, differentiation, and invasion (PMID: 18483217). Overexpression of PDGFB is implicated in several cancer types and promotes tumor progression in preclinical studies (PMID: 18478301). Rearrangements involving PDGFB are found in patients with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, a sarcoma of the skin (PMID: 17431412, 12131162). These translocations result in enhanced expression of PDGFB and increased PDGFR signaling activity, suggesting that PDGFRB functions as an oncogene (PMID: 17431412, 12131162).

    "PDGFRB (platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta), is a transmembrane receptor-tyrosine kinase whose ligands are the homodimers PDGF-BB and PDGF-DD (PMID: 18483217, 20581310). Upon binding to PDGF ligand, the receptor undergoes homodimerization (or heterodimerization with PDGFRα), bringing the intracellular kinase domains into proximity and triggering kinase activation. Downstream signaling pathways include JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, PLCγ, and NF-κB (PMID: 18483217, 20581310). PDGFRB is primarily expressed on cells of mesenchymal origin (e.g. fibroblasts, endothelium) and is involved in organ development, angiogenesis and wound repair (PMID: 7958864, 10375497, 18483217, 20581310). Although PDGFRB plays a role in early hematopoiesis, its role in adult hematopoietic cells is less clear (PMID: 7958864, 11264163). Pathologic overexpression of PDGFRB in hematopoietic cells contributes to neoplastic growth and progression (PMID: 20581310). Although PDGF/PDGFR signaling appears to play an important role in numerous types of solid tumors, mutations, amplifications or translocations/fusions of PDGFRB are relatively rare in most solid tumors (PMID: 18483217).",

    "PDK1 encodes for a master serine/threonine kinase which functions in the regulation the activation of at least 23 other kinases, including the AKT serine/threonine kinase family and AGC serine/threonine kinase family (PMID: 24352480, 9368760, 20027184, 23448267). PDK1 can activate and control the expression of various downstream substrates, including CDKN1B, CCND1 and PI3K, to regulate critical cellular processes such as proliferation, cell cycle control and survival (PMID: 18430722, 23893244, 34646383). Overexpression of PDK1 in various types of cancer cell lines and models induces aberrant cellular proliferation, adhesion, invasion and tumor growth, suggesting that PDK1 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 31646108, 32071289, 27878287, 36474273). Amplification of PDK1 has been identified in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer (PMID: 21542898, 23401739, 33403023). Aberrant PDK1 expression has been implicated in conferring chemoresistance in various cancer cell models through hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR downstream signaling (PMID: 24044505, 36474273, 37169941).",
    "PDPK1 (also known as PDK1) encodes for 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 that mediates downstream signaling from phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). It is a serine-threonine kinase that responds to mitogenic and insulin signals to phosphorylate targets including the AGC family of kinases such as p70 S6K and AKT (PMID: 10801415, 9094314, 9427642). Breast cancer and multiple myeloma cells have shown dependency on PDPK1 for survival and tumor progression (PMID: 19573809, 25269480). In pancreatic cancer, PDPK1 signaling can contribute to Kras oncogenic activity (PMID: 23453624). The PDPK1 gene has been found to be amplified in breast and thyroid cancers (PMID: 19602588, 18492751).

    "PDS5B (also AS3 and APRIN) is a protein that binds cohesin, a ring-like structure that regulates sister chromatid segregation during cell division (PMID: 15855230). PDS5B mediates cohesin-dependent sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis or meiosis to ensure proper chromosome-spindle attachments (PMID: 26903600). In addition, PDS5B activity is important for the maintenance of the curved interface of the cohesin ring and for the dissolution of the cohesin complex during mitosis to allow for appropriate chromosome segregation (PMID: 15855230, 27549742). PDS5B mediates additional cellular functions including regulation of stem cell function (PMID: 20383194) and chromatin looping (PMID: 29217591). PDS5B also interacts with BRCA2 to mediate DNA repair and is located on a chromosomal region that contains BRCA2 that is commonly lost in breast cancer (PMID: 22293751). Loss of PDS5B expression results in chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy and developmental defects in mice (PMID: 17652350, 24141881). PDS5B also mediates androgen-dependent signals that are required for growth arrest in prostate cells (PMID: 18499069, 10215036, 10963680). Germline mutations in PDS5B are found in patients with cohesinopathies, such as Cornelia de Lange syndrome (PMID: 19412548). Somatic loss-of-function mutations in PDS5B are found in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia as well as some solid tumors (PMID: 26492932, 23850494, 19737411), suggesting that PDS5B functions as a tumor suppressor. PDS5B expression is also correlated with improved patient survival and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents (PMID: 27924011, 22293751).",
    "PGBD5 is a DNA transposase that is a member of the piggyBac transposase family (PMID: 24180413, 26406119). piggyBac transposases mediate the mobility of genetic elements flanked by inverted terminal repeats (ITR) and reintegrate these elements, termed transposons, into another location in the genome via a “cut and paste” mechanism (PMID: 24180413, 26406119). Transposons mediate genetic evolution and comprise half of the human genome, with PGDB5 functioning as the most conserved transposase in humans (PMID: 26406119). PGBD5 is predominantly expressed in the brain and in the central nervous system during development (PMID: 24180413). Increased expression of PGBD5 in cell lines and murine models results in transformation, suggesting that PGBD5 functions as an oncogene (PMID: 28504702). Overexpression of PGBD5 is found in childhood cancers including rhabdoid tumors, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma and Ewing sarcoma (PMID: 28504702, 30333322). PGBD5 promotes the formation of chromosomal rearrangements by binding site-specific sequences and disrupting the expression of tumor suppressor genes (PMID: 30333322). Oncogenic PGBD5 activity requires DNA end-joining repair and is sensitive to ATM and ATR inhibition (PMID: 29093183).",
    "PGR encodes the progesterone receptor (PR) which is a nuclear hormone receptor. It bind to progesterone in the cytoplasm and dimerizes. The complex then enters the nucleus and binds to DNA. PR then modulates transcription depending on its isoform and on the pattern of phosphorylation at a large number of possible sites (PMID: 11110801). PR is essential in the coordination of the reproductive cycle and is especially associated with the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. PR has been shown to interact with STAT3 (PMID: 21184768) and the SP1 transcription factor (PMID: 21184768).The PR protein is commonly expressed in breast and endometrial tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2016; PMID: 11041059, 8319181) and provides a key prognostic indicator alongside the presence and absence of estrogen receptor (ER) (PMID: 1634918). PGR can be involved in other tumor types (PMID: 26892043, 26976979) and is mutated in a range of solid tumors especially at the R740 codon in the ligand binding domain (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2016). Germline mutations in PGR are associated with endometrial cancer (PMID: 26881523). PR is targeted to some extent by endocrine therapy, PGR expression has been associated with response to tamoxifen in ER- patients (PMID: 16497822).",

PHF19 binding to H3K36me3 is a mark of transcriptional activation and leads to the association of H3K36me3 demethylases and recruitment of the PRC2 complex (PMID: 23160351, 23228662). Recruiting the PRC2 complex causes PRC2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation and the demethylation of H3K36 and subsequent transcriptional silencing (PMID: 23160351). Overexpression of PHF19 in multiple myeloma and prostate cancer cell lines induces cellular proliferation, growth and metastasis, suggesting that PHF19 functions primarily as an oncogene (PMID: 32155117, 31383640).

    "PIGA deletion mutations typically result in the loss of protein expression. In vitro studies with PIGA-deficient JY5 cells demonstrate that loss of PIGA is inactivating as measured by reduced expression of GPI-anchored proteins compared to wildtype (PMID: 24706016)",
    "PIGA (also PIG-A) is an enzyme involved in the first step of the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway (PMID: 8500164). Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors are post-translational modifications that attach the C-terminal of extracellular proteins to the cellular membrane (PMID: 8500164, 22265715). Cell surface proteins require GPI anchors for attachment at the membrane as well as for protein sorting, signal transduction, and immune regulation (PMID: 25885527). GPI anchors are added to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) prior to protein sorting (PMID: 8500164, 9463366). PIGA is the catalytic enzyme in the GPI-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (GlcNAc) complex that is responsible for the first step in GPI synthesis (PMID: 8500164, 9463366). PIG-A initiates the formation of the intermediate N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphatidylinositol by transferring GlcNAc to phosphatidylinsositol (PI) (PMID: 8500164). GPI anchoring is required during embryogenesis and loss of PIGA in mice results in embryonic lethality (PMID: 7851884).

    "Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is comprised of a regulatory subunit (p85α) as well as a catalytic subunit (p110α) and it is the catalytic subunit that is encoded by the PIK3CA gene. PIK3CA is among the most commonly mutated genes in cancer and aberrant activation of PI3K is a transforming event (PMID: 17376864). Multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, ERBB2 (HER2), RET, MET, and VEGFR, among others, convert extracellular cues into intracellular signals and recruit PI3K to the plasma membrane via scaffold proteins such as IRS1 or by activating RAS. Upon stimulation, PI3K-110α converts its lipid substrate PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol - 4,5 - bisphosphate) to PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol - 3,4,5 - bisphosphate), which activates several signaling cascades, including the well-characterized AKT-mTOR pathway. Once activated, AKT-mTOR downstream signaling promotes cell survival, proliferation, growth and motility (PMID: 16341083). Adding to this complexity, exposure to some PI3K/mTOR pathway-targeted drugs relieves cancer cells of self-regulatory properties inherent in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway thereby promoting tumor resistance to these agents (PMID: 22576208).",
    "The ACPP-PIK3CB fusion results in the fusion of ACPP exons 1-2 with PIK3CB exons 2-22, including the PIK3CB catalytic kinase domain. This mutation has been found in prostate cancer (PMID: 26000489)",
    ". Expression of this mutation in prostate cancer tumor samples demonstrated that it is likely activating as measured by increased PIK3CB protein expression, which has been shown to be activating in chicken embryo fibroblasts by increased pathway activation and colony formation (PMID: 16432180)",
    "PIK3CB, also known as p110-β, is a catalytic subunit of PI3K that is important in creating phosphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which acts as a secondary messenger in key cellular signaling pathways such as AKT-mTOR. PIK3CB plays a critical role in tumorigenesis driven by loss of PTEN (PMID: 18755892, 18594509) and drives PI3K signaling. Roles other than oncogenic activation of PI3K/AKT pathway have also been described for PIK3CB, including effects on growth and cell metabolism, including insulin signaling (PMID: 18594509, 18780892, 26132308). In HER2-amplified and PIK3CA-mutant cancers, inhibition of PIK3CA can lead to reactivation of PI3K signaling through PIK3CB (PMID: 25544637). Hence, combined inhibition of both isoforms is a promising therapeutic strategy that blocks pathway activation and leads to successful tumor regression (PMID: 25544636, 25544637, 25409150).",
    "The PIK3CD G124D mutation is located between the p85 binding domain and the RAS binding domain of the protein. Expression of this mutation in Ba/F3 and MCF10A cells demonstrated it is activating as measured by increased factor-independent proliferation compared to wildtype PIK3CD (PMID: 29533785)",
    "PIK3CD, also known as p110-ẟ, is a catalytic subunit of PI3K that is important in creating phosphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which acts as a secondary messenger in key cellular signaling pathways such as AKT-mTOR. PIK3CD primarily functions in immune cells through AKT signaling. It is required for T-cell receptor activation (PMID: 12130661), and it is also necessary for a full antibody response in B-cells (PMID: 12235209). Germline mutations in PIK3CD likely causes both immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferative disease as a result of hyperactivation of AKT-mTOR signaling, which forces the differentiation of naive CD8+ T-cells into short-lived effector cells and reduces long-term memory T- and B-cells (PMID: 24165795). Idelalisib, a specific inhibitor of PIK3CD, has been used with Rituximab (a CD20 antibody) in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and has been associated with significant increase in progression-free survival (PMID: 24450857).",
    "PIK3CG (phosphatidelinositol-4,5-bisphophsphate3-kinase catalytic subunit gamma), also known as p110-gamma, is a class I catalytic subunit of PI3-kinase and acts as a lipid and protein kinase that phosphorylates phosphoinositides (PMID: 17290298). PIK3CG is involved in extracellular signaling and linking cell-surface receptors to intracellular signaling networks, such as the PI3-kinase/AKT pathway (PMID: 12040186). Once activated, AKT-mTOR downstream signaling promotes cell survival, proliferation, growth and motility (PMID: 16341083). PIK3CG is primarily expressed in white blood cells, and through its direct interactions with RAS and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (PMID: 12507995) is important in immune cell responses and inflammatory stimuli (PMID: 10669418). While deletions of PIK3CG are often found in myeloid malignancies in conjunction with broad 7q22 deletion, PIK3CG is not likely a tumor suppressor in these settings (PMID: 11756194).",
    "Deletions of PIK3R1 resulting in loss of the regulatory subunit of PI(3)-kinase have been identified in patients with breast cancer (PMID: 24229379)",
    ". Studies in primary human immunodeficiency with lymphoproliferation demonstrate that PIK3R1 truncating mutations likely lead to loss of PIK3R1 function, as measured by increased pathway activation, proliferation and survival compared to wildtype (PMID: 25133428, 25488983)",
    ". These mutations are predicted to disrupt the ability of p85α to inhibit the PI3K catalytic subunit, p110α, thus resulting in aberrant activation of AKT-mTOR signaling",
    "PIK3R1 encodes p85α, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)(PMID: 12040186). In the absence of upstream receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation, p85α both stabilizes and inhibits the activity of p110α, the catalytic subunit of PI3K. Upon RTK activation, p85α binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of RTKs. Subsequently, this recruits the PI3K enzymatic complex to the cell membrane and allows the p110α catalytic subunit to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (PMID: 12040186, 1707345, 2833705). The production of PIP3 results in recruitment and activation of the serine/threonine kinase, AKT, which in turn activates numerous downstream targets (e.g. mTOR) involved in cell growth, proliferation and survival (PMID: 12094235). PIK3R1 mutations occur most frequently in its two SRC Homology 2 (SH2) domains, nSH2 and iSH2 (PMID: 21478295, 19962665). These mutations disrupt the ability of p85α to inhibit the PI3K catalytic subunit, thus resulting in aberrant activation of AKT-mTOR signaling (PMID: 9450999, 11606375, 15932879, 17626883, 18079394, 19962665). Across all tumor types, PIK3R1 mutations tend to be mutually exclusive with alterations in TP53, PIK3CA, SETD2 and WT1 (PMID: 24132290). PIK3R1 mutations are prevalent in glioblastoma and to a lesser extent in endometrial, breast and colorectal cancers (PMID: 23636398, 24120142, 17932254, 22810696).",
    "Genomic amplification of PIK3R2 increases the number of copies of PIK3R2 in the genome, and can lead to increased transcription of the gene. In turn, increased transcription of PIK3R2 may increase activation of the Pi3K signaling pathway and its associated downstream targets. Although the consequences of PIK3R2 amplification have not been thoroughly investigated across multiple cancer lineages, in glioblastoma multiforme, amplification of PIK3R2 was predicted to lead to an increase in phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate and increased signaling via the AKT/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway (PMID: 25502460)",
    "PIK3R2, also known as p55-β, is a regulatory subunit of PI3K and functions to regulate activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) via direct interaction (PMID: 12094235). It is thus important in regulating various downstream activities in the cell, such as growth, proliferation and motility. Upon RTK activation, PIK3R2 helps recruit the PI3K enzymatic complex to the cell membrane and allows the PI3K catalytic subunit to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is important in activating downstream signaling pathways such as AKT-mTOR (PMID: 12040186). PIK3R2 mutations are often found in endometrial cancers with wildtype PTEN, and allow for increased PI3K and downstream AKT signaling (PMID: 21984976).",
    "Truncating mutations in PIK3R3 result in PIK3R3 C-terminal truncated proteins (PMID: 27766312)",
    ". In a single study with lymphatic endothelial cells harboring PIK3R3 mutations, mutant cells were demonstrated to exhibit increased phosphorylated AKT and were associated with increased sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294 as well as mTOR inhibitor rapamycin when compared to normal endothelial cells (PMID: 25424831)",
    "The PIK3R3 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit gamma) protein, also known as p55-gamma, is a regulatory subunit of PI3K and functions to regulate activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) via direct interaction (PMID: 12094235). It is thus important in regulating various downstream activities in the cell, such as growth, proliferation and motility. Upon RTK activation, PIK3R3 helps recruit the PI3K enzymatic complex to the cell membrane and allows the PI3K catalytic subunit to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is important in activating downstream signaling pathways such as AKT-mTOR (PMID: 12040186). PIK3R3 has been shown to directly modulate IGF2 signaling in glioblastoma and is amplified in some cases (PMID: 17360667, 16530701).",
    "The PIM1 L2V mutation occurs in the N terminus of the protein, prior to a kinase domain. In a lymphoma cell line, expression of L2V did not alter cell proliferation or viability compared to the wildtype. In a colony formation assay, however, the mutated protein altered morphology and increased the number of colonies.

DAG and IP3 are secondary messengers that mediate cellular signaling pathways (PMID: 29174396, 23140367). IP3 binds calcium-mediated receptors resulting in an increase in cytosolic calcium concentrations and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (PMID: 9096335, 10373546, 19179337). PLCG1 activity is regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as PDGFR, VEGFR, and EGFR, in response to hormones and growth factors (PMID: 9096335). PLCG1-regulated signal transduction pathways, such as the MAPK and JNK pathways, regulate a variety of cellular processes including migration, proliferation, oxidative stress, angiogenesis and transformation (PMID: 11931670, 15944397). Somatic mutations in PLCG1 have been identified in T-cell lymphomas (PMID: 24497536, 25304611, 26415585, 26437031), Sezary syndrome (a leukemic variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas) (PMID: 27121473, 26415585) and angiosarcomas (PMID: 24633157, 25252913).

The enzyme is autoinhibited by a C-terminal SH2 domain and activated by phosphorylation (PMID: 20807769). It is expressed mainly in B-cells and Natural Killer cells where it acts to transduce signals from the immunglobulin family of receptors (PMID: 10933392, 16002670).

    "PMAIP1, also known as NOXA, encodes for phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1, a gene involved in regulating apoptosis (PMID: 15694340). PMAIP1 contains a Bcl2 homology 3 (BH3) domain that mediates interactions with Bcl-2 family member proteins to alter the balance towards pro-apoptosis (PMID: 15901672). Specifically, inhibition of Mcl-1 by PMAIP1 can lead to mitochondrial cytochrome c release and cell death (PMID: 17115033). PMAIP1 is induced by TP53 as a consequence of DNA damage and other death signals such as c-Myc induction (PMID: 10807576, 18042711, 23948298, 23153536, 19647221).

    "PMS1 is one of four MutL homologs that functions in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, which is important in detecting and repairing nucleotide base mismatches. Within the MMR system, PMS1 forms a heterodimer with MLH1 (known as the MutLβ complex); in humans the specific function of this complex is unknown (PMID: 24614649, 16136382). The MMR system primarily acts as a sensory system that scans newly synthesized DNA for base pair mismatches caused by DNA polymerase strand slippage. Upon recognition of DNA mismatches, the MMR system recruits repair enzymes that excise mismatched bases and initiates resynthesis along the parental template by DNA polymerase. Loss of function of the MMR system leads to an accumulation of distinct single nucleotide mutations and alterations known as microsatellite instability (MSI), which can cause frameshift mutations or protein truncations, potentially increasing the risk of tumorigenesis (PMID: 24614649). Germline mutations in PMS1 have been shown to be involved in Lynch syndrome, which can cause a predisposition to certain types of cancer, including colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer (PMID: 15528792). Patients who are MMR-deficient have also been shown to respond well to PD-1 blockade immunotherapies, hence the FDA-approval of pembrolizumab for patients with MSI-high or MMR-deficient tumors regardless of tumor etiology (PMID: 26028255).",

    "PMS2 is an endonuclease that plays an essential role in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Specifically, PMS2 nicks DNA to initiate excision of a mismatched strand (PMID: 20624957). Mutations in PMS2 lead to an inability to correctly repair mismatches and insertion/deletion loops in the DNA, which results in increased tumor hypermutation and a microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) phenotype (PMID: 14871975). Germline mutations of PMS2 can cause Lynch syndrome, which predisposes to certain cancers including colon, endometrial and ovarian cancers and implicates PMS2 as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 16472587). Sporadic PMS2 mutations have also been reported in cancers from numerous tissue types (PMID: 16472587). Tumor hypermutation has been associated with response to certain immunotherapies. Specifically, pembrolizumab has been FDA approved for all MMR-deficient and MSI tumors, irrespective of specific tumor etiology (PMID: 25409260, 26028255).",
    "PNRC1 is a nuclear receptor coactivator that modulates the transcriptional activation of a variety of nuclear receptors. Among these, the nuclear receptors (e.g. estrogen receptor α and β, progesterone receptor, androgen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor) bind PNRC1 in a ligand-dependent manner, whereas the orphan receptors (e.g. steroidogenic factor 1 and estrogen-related receptor α 1) interact with PNRC1 in a ligand-independent manner (PMID: 23925889, 17068076, 15604093). PNRC1 also stimulates transcription by RNA polymerase III through direct binding of its subunit RPC39 (PMID: 7578250, 10894149, 17612402). In addition to its function as a modulator of transcription, PNRC1 plays an important role in the Ras-MAPK pathway, where it downregulates the signaling cascade through its interaction with Grb2 (PMID: 15122321). Downregulation of PNRC1 has been observed in various tumor types including breast, gastric, hepatocellular and colorectal carcinomas; however, somatic mutations in PNRC1 are infrequent in human cancers (PMID: 15122321, 11768609).",

    "POLD1 is the catalytic subunit of the DNA polymerase δ complex p125. The p125 subunit contains both polymerase and 3ꞌ to 5ꞌ exonuclease activity (PMID: 7490075, 9030545). POLD1 is involved in DNA synthesis of the lagging strand during DNA replication, proofreading activity during polymerization and DNA repair (PMID: 18439893, 10781066, 11027336). In functional studies, reduced expression of POLD1 was shown to cause genomic instability resulting from the accrual of errors during DNA replication. Furthermore, reduced expression of POLD1 was associated with fragile site instability and a high frequency of chromosomal aberrations (PMID: 11003646, 18591249). Recent studies have demonstrated that levels of POLD1 protein decrease with age, resulting in reduced DNA repair capacity (PMID: 22915169, 21556771). Germline loss-of-function mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLD1 are responsible for several disorders including the distinct multisystem disorder characterized by subcutaneous lipodystrophy, deafness, mandibular hypoplasia and hypogonadism in males (PMID: 23770608, 25131834). Heterozygous germline mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLD1 also predispose individuals to colorectal and endometrial cancers (PMID: 23263490, 24501277, 23528559, 26133394). In addition, associations between POLD1 variants and breast cancer risk have been shown in several studies (PMID: 15113441, 25023197, 16685647).

Germline loss-of-function mutations in POLE have been identified in patients with polyposis and predisposition to colorectal cancer (PMID: 26133394, 29072370, 24501277). Several recurrent mutation hotspots in the exonuclease domain of POLE have been identified as impacting its proofreading capability and leading to ultra-high mutation rates, primarily in cancers of the colon, rectum and endometrium. Somatic mutations in the proofreading domain of POLE have been reported in endometrial cancers (PMID: 23636398, 25505230) and colorectal cancers (PMID: 25228659).

Mutations in the polymerase domain of POLG lead to reduction in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, decreased oxidative phosphorylation and increased cell migration in breast cancer cell lines (PMID: 19629138). Furthermore, mice with POLG mutations affecting the exonuclease \bdomain exhibit accumulation of mtDNA mutations, earlier onset of ag\bing phenotypes and increased apoptotic markers compared to wildtype (PMID: 16020738). Autosomal dominant or recessive mutations in POLG, mostly in the polymerase domain, are associated with mitochondrial diseases such as Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PMID: 23545419, 11431686).

    "POT1 is a telomere binding protein that is a component of shelterin (PMID: 29149597, 30208292). Shelterin is a protein complex that protects the ends of chromosomes, or telomeres, from inappropriate DNA repair mechanisms (PMID: 27218840). Telomeres are repetitive sequences at the end of chromosomes that prevent fusion with other chromosomes, maintain chromosome integrity, and are implicated in aging and cancer (PMID: 15181449). POT1 is an oligonucleotide binding protein that interacts with single-stranded DNA on telomeres and controls telomerase-mediated telomere elongation (PMID: 12768206). In addition, POT1 binds other telomere regulatory proteins including TRF1 (Telomere Repeat Factor 1), which inhibits unnecessary telomere extension (PMID: 15231715). POT1 also interacts with other telomere interacting proteins including PIP1 (POT-interacting protein), TIN2 (TRF1-interacting factor) and TPP1, among others, to maintain telomere stability and to recruit telomerase (PMID: 15231715, 15181449). Disruption of these protein interactions with POT1 results in aberrant mutagenic alternative non-homologous end joining (A-NHEJ) leading to genomic instability and chromosome fusions (PMID: 28393832, 27869160). Inhibition of POT1 expression also results in the activation of ATR-dependent DNA damage resulting in replication stress (PMID: 27239034). Germline loss-of-function mutations in POT1 are found in familial cutaneous melanoma, lymphoma and glioma (PMID: 24686849, 25482530, 29693246). Somatic loss-of-function POT1 mutations are found in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and disrupt oligonucleotide binding activity (PMID: 23502782).

    "The PPP2R1A gene encodes protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in cell growth and division (PMID: 11171037). PP2A activity has long been considered an important tumor suppressor (PMID: 2153055), although recent evidence suggests that it may function as an oncogene in some context (PMID: 27272709). The PPP2R1A gene encodes the 'scaffolding' subunit of the PP2A trimeric holoenzyme, so named because it bridges PP2A's catalytic subunit to a myriad of targeting subunits (PMID: 17055435). Targeting subunits confer specificity for substrate selection and enzyme localization in the cell. PPP2R1A mutations have recently been found to positively correlate with whole-genome doublings in human cancers (PMID: 24071852). These mutations have been identified in uterine (endometrial) carcinomas (PMID: 23636398, 21435433, 21381030, 21435433), uterine (serous) carcinomas (PMID: 21435433) , ovarian low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous carcinomas (PMID: 21435433, 20826764, 21381030). The functional impact of these mutations during tumorigenesis is limited, however, the available studies describing these mutations indicate that normal function of PPP2R1A is tumor suppressive (PMID: 22262169).",

    "PPP2R2A (also PR55α) is a subunit of the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) that is a member of the PP2A regulatory B subunit family (PMID: 18588945). PP2A is a trimeric enzyme, which is composed of a catalytic subunit, a scaffold subunit, and one of 18 regulatory subunits, such as PPP2R2A, functioning as the predominant serine/threonine phosphatase (PMID: 18588945). PPP2R2A binding contributes to the selectivity of the PP2A phosphatase for substrates (PMID: 18588945, 18042541). Oncogenes, such as MYC and AKT, are negatively regulated by PPP2R2A activity (PMID: 32522823). Dephosphorylation of these targets results in altered cellular functions including reduced proliferation and cellular survival (PMID: 18042541, 12932319). In addition, PPP2R2A regulates ATM dephosphorylation, leading to homologous recombination at sites of DNA damage in the genome (PMID: 23087057). PPP2R2A has additional protein targets including AP-1, HDAC4, and TFGBR1, among others (PMID: 18158287, 12912990, 18045992, 12932319, 14712210, 9774674). Somatic PPP2R2A loss-of-function mutations and deletions have been reported in many cancer types, including prostate, ovarian and non-small cell lung cancers (PMID: 21872824, 23087057, 25879784, 31349904, 27531894), and are predictive or poor survival (PMID: 32522823, 25879784, 31822657, 26893480, 25879784). In loss-of-function preclinical studies, PPP2R2A deletion corresponded to increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, such as ATR, CHK1, and PARP1 inhibitors, due to elevation of replication stress pathways (PMID: 32522823, 23087057).",
    "PPP4R2 encodes a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 4 (PPP4C), a protein serine/threonine phosphatase that has been implicated in microtubule organization at centrosomes. PPP4R2 may be instrumental in targeting PPP4 catalytic subunit (PPP4c) to the centrosomes, and may also regulate (inhibit) the activity of PPP4c at centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (PMID: 10769191). PPP4R2 interacts with Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN) protein complex and is essential for differentiation of neuronal cells (PMID: 22559936) as well as for temporal localization of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), suggesting a role in maturation of spliceosomal snRNPs (PMID: 12668731). PPP4R2 is part of a conserved ternary complex including PPP4R3 and PPP4c that mediates dephosphorylation of RPA2 and γH2AX, and is required for DNA double strand break repair (PMID: 18614045, 20154705).",

    "The PPP6C gene encodes the catalytic subunit of serine/threonine phosphatase 6 (PP6) (PMID: 9143513), which integrates signaling from multiple pathways. In normal cells, PP6 regulates cell cycle progression, and hence restricts G1 to S phase progression in cancer cells (PMID: 9013334, 21187329, 10227379). PP6 plays an important role in oocyte meiosis, and loss of PP6 protein is associated with female infertility (PMID: 26349807). In addition, PP6 is involved in the homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation; it also plays an important role in inflammatory responses by IL-1 via dephosphorylation of Thr-187 in the activation loop of TAK1 (PMID: 21451261, 17079228). PP6 has been shown to promote replication of influenza A virus (PMID: 25187537). PP6’s involvement in cancer has been largely established. Somatic mutations that lead to inactivation of the protein, loss of heterozygosity and nonsense mutations are observed in approximately 10% of melanomas harboring NRAS or BRAF mutations; these mutations are associated with poor prognosis (PMID: 24336958, 22842228, 24755198, 23729733, 22817889). Overexpression of PPP6C in glioblastoma is associated with worse overall survival (PMID: 25332711, 22395973); downregulation of PP6, which is dependent on miR-373, is observed in hepatocellular carcinoma and mesothelioma (PMID: 21481188, 20463022). PPP6C mutations play a role in the progression of thyroid cancer (PMID: 24718460).",

PRDM1 was initially described as a transcriptional repressor of interferon ß, and as an essential component of B cell differentiation, wherein it represses MYC (PMID: 1851123, 9887105, 8168136, 9110979). More recent results from animal studies indicate PRDM1 as an important factor in establishment in the germ cell lineage, T cell differentiation and homeostasis and heart function (PMID: 15937476, 16565720, 24821700). Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located intergenic to PRDM1 and ATG5 have been associated with increased risk for radiation therapy-induced second malignant neoplasms after radiotherapy for pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma (PMID: 21785431).",
    "The PRDM14 gene encodes a zinc-finger protein that acts as a transcriptional regulator. It belongs to the PRDM family of genes, which exert both positive and negative roles in the transcription of genes involved in development, and either possess or enhance histone methyltransferase activity (PMID: 22669819, 22028065). PRDM14 plays an important role in the establishment of germ cell lineage in mice (PMID: 18665129, 18622394). Additionally, PRDM14 is required for the maintenance of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) identity, and enhances the reprogramming of human fibroblasts into hESC by co-regulating the expression of key genes (PMID: 20953172, 24268575). PRDM14 overexpression in breast cancer cells leads to increased growth and colony formation capabilities and decreased apoptosis (PMID: 17942894). PRDM14 is overexpressed or amplified in a subset of breast and prostate cancers (PMID: 17942894, 2016).",

    "The PREX2 gene encodes a protein that facilitates the exchange of GDP to GTP on RAC1, leading to the activation of its downstream effectors. PREX2 is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and G-protein coupled receptors and mediates the PI3K pathway-dependent activation of RAC1 (PMID: 15304343, 15304342, 15897194). PREX2 can activate the PI3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway by antagonizing PTEN inhibitory effects (PMID: 19729658); conversely, PTEN negatively regulates PREX2-mediated oncogenic effects (PMID: 25829446). PREX2 activation increases cell proliferation, activates PI3K signaling and downregulates tumor suppressors such as CDKN1C in NRAS-mutant melanoma (PMID: 25829446, 26884185). Oncogenic effects of PREX2 have also been described in other cancers (PMID: 26718453), as well as a role for PREX2 in the insulin signaling pathway (PMID: 26438819).

    "PRKACA, a catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), is involved in the phosphorylation of many cellular proteins important for cell proliferation, maturation, and apoptosis. Cyclic-AMP (cAMP)-dependent activation of PKA leads to the release of PKA regulatory subunits and subsequent phosphorylation of a number of downstream substrates. Cellular substrates of PKA, including transcription factors such as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), are involved in the activation of multiple downstream processes, typically those involved in cellular metabolism. Fusions of PRKACA to DNAJB1 are the defining oncogenic alteration in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) (PMID: 25557953, 25698061, 25605237, 25122662, 24578576, 26489647). PRKACA overexpression has been identified in HER2-targeted breast carcinoma (PMID: 24909179), and an activating hotspot mutation (L205R) in PRKACA has been frequently identified in patients with adrenal Cushing's syndrome (PMID: 24700472).",
    "PRKAR1A is a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent regulatory subunit that inhibits the catalytic subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) (PMID: 15331577). Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunit PRKAR1A releases the catalytic subunits of PKA to phosphorylate target proteins, resulting in the activation of signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, cell division and invasion (PMID: 26042218, 27995993). Germline mutations in PRKAR1A are responsible for the Carney complex disorder characterized by skin pigmented lesions, myxomas, collagenomas and fibromas (PMID: 10973256) and for primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease leading to Cushing's syndrome (PMID: 17036196, 12424709). Deletions and loss-of-function mutations in PRKAR1A have been identified in adrenocortical tumors (PMID: 14500362). Missense and nonsense mutations result in decreased cAMP-dependent dissociation of PKA catalytic subunits, suggesting that PRKAR1A functions as a tumor suppressor.

    "The PRKCI gene encodes the protein kinase C iota, an atypical serine/threonine kinase involved in multiple cellular processes. PRKCI protects BCR-ABL leukemia cells from undergoing apoptosis (PMID: 9346882). It also enhances cell proliferation and survival via NF-KB pathway activation (PMID: 10467349, 10356400). PRKCI promotes colony formation and tumor growth in vivo (PMID: 15994303) and cooperates with SOX2 to activate the Hedgehog signaling pathway in lung cancers (PMID: 24525231). PRKCI phosphorylates BAD in glioma cells, thus allowing them to evade apoptosis (PMID: 21419810).

It is part of a family of serine protease enzymes that perform a wide variety of functions including immune response, digestion, blood coagulation and reproduction (PMID: 12475199). Germline mutations in PRSS1 are associated with premature activation of trypsin-1 causing pancreatic self-digestion that results in pancreatitis and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (PMID: 23187834, 25479140).

PSMB2, along with the other six beta subunits, form the proteasome complex's proteolytic chamber through the assembly of two heptameric rings (PMID: 12015144). Overexpression of PSMB2 promotes tumorigenesis through decreasing homologous recombination, impairing DNA double-strand break repair, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (PMID: 21660142, 36110152). In vitro knockdown of PSMB2 in cell lines suppresses proteasome complex activity and cell proliferation, and promotes apoptosis (PMID: 36110152).

PTCH1 functions as the primary receptor for sonic hedgehog (SHH), a secreted protein involved in embryonic development (PMID: 11001584, 8906787). In response to SHH, PTCH1 binds and inhibits Smoothened (SMO), a G protein-coupled receptor; this results in decreased signaling via the HH pathway (PMID: 14737121). Thus, PTCH1 functions as a classic tumor suppressor by inhibiting SMO-mediated oncogenic signaling. Germline PTCH1 mutations are associated with the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS, Gorlin syndrome), which predisposes patients to basal cell carcinoma as well as medulloblastoma (PMID: 8658145).

    "PTEN is a tumor suppressor that is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer (PMID: 9072974, 9090379, 22473468). PTEN has several physiological functions, most notably operating as a phosphatase that converts phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-diphosphate (PIP2) at the cell membrane (PMID: 18767981). Impairment of PTEN function through multiple mechanisms, including through non-synonymous mutations, results in PIP3 accumulation and constitutive activation of catabolic downstream AKT/mTOR signaling. Therefore, PTEN inactivation promotes cell growth, proliferation and survival (PMID: 12040186). Additionally, nuclear PTEN is thought to regulate RAD51 expression, and in this way is also associated with homologous recombination and repair of DNA strand breaks (PMID: 17218262, 23888040). Thus, loss of PTEN may also lead to greater genomic instability and provide a setting for the accumulation of other deleterious mutations. PTEN is frequently mutated in many types of human cancers (PMID: 15254063). Germline loss-of-function PTEN mutations occur in approximately 80% of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome Cowden disease, which is associated with high-penetrance breast and thyroid cancer (PMID: 9467011, 24136893, 21430697).",
    "The PTP4A1 gene encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) with a characteristic PTP domain that is necessary to dephosphorylate its substrates, and a prenylation domain that allows the protein to bind the plasma membrane (PMID: 9018080, 15571731). PRP4A1 forms part of the mitotic spindle and stimulates progression from G1 to S phases during mitosis, probably via negative regulation of the p21 tumor suppressor (PMID: 12235145, 14643450). PTP4A1 enhances cell migration, invasion and metastasis by activating SRC and ERK pathways (PMID: 12782572, 19199380). THE PTP4A1 gene is rarely altered in human tumors, only being amplified in a small subset of tumors such as prostate cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).",
    "Expression of truncated PTPN1 mutants in HEK293 cells and knockout of PTPN1 in a human lymphoma cell line demonstrated loss of PTPN1 is activating as measured by increased JAK/STAT signaling (PMID: 24531327)",
    ". Knockout of PTPN1 in mouse models has been shown to accelerate lymphomagenesis and induce myeloproliferative disorders (PMID: 16267035, 28111468)",
    "PTPN1 (also PTP1B) is a tyrosine phosphatase that functions as a signaling protein. PTPN1 is implicated as a negative regulator of the insulin pathway and removes phosphat molecules from activated insulin receptor kinase (PMID: 11884589). In addition, PTPN1 regulates the activity of a variety of other kinases implicated in a variety of cellular contexts including EGFR (PMID: 9050838), JAK2 (PMID: 11694501), TYK2 (PMID: 11694501), and FAK (PMID: 16291744), among others. PTPN1 activity has been associated with the regulation of several cellular processes including invasion (PMID: 18332219), cytokine sensitivity (PMID: 26817397), cell adhesion (PMID: 10409197), and proliferation (PMID: 14766979). Loss of PTPN1 in preclinical studies leads to increased JAK-STAT pathway activity in hematopoietic cells (PMID: 24531327) and deletion of PTPN1 in mice results in a hematopoietic malignancy (PMID: 28111468). Somatic mutations in PTPN1 have been identified in lymphomas including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and Hodgkin’s lymphoma (PMID: 29650799, 24531327). PTPN1 alterations are largely loss-of-function mutations that are associated with reduced PTPN1 protein expression and phosphatase activity, suggesting that PTPN1 functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 24531327). However, overexpression of PTPN1 truncation and splice mutations in cell lines results in transformation, implicating some alterations as dominant negative mutations (PMID: 27855221). In addition, the PTPN1 gene lies within the 20q region that is frequently deleted in myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes (PMID: 7949181) and amplified in breast and ovarian cancers (PMID: 8758909, 10815905). PTPN1 fusion proteins have also been identified in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (PMID: 27268263).",
    "The causative role of PTPN11 deficiency remains to be determined, but is likely due to a loss-of-function mutation (PMID: 22869052)",
    ". In a mouse model, selective deletion of PTPN11 in hepatocytes led to impaired regenerative capacity of the liver following hepatectomy. Though the association of PTPN11-activating mutations with oncogenes would lead to the anticipation that inactivating mutations of PTPN11 would be protective against malignancy development this was not the case. Indeed, at 12-months, PTPN11 deficient mice developed macroscopic adenomas suggesting a duality to PTPN11, and its potential role as a tumor suppressor.",
    "If the Oncogenic Mutations occur at PTPN11, could lead ton Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia",
    "PTPN11 (also known as SHP2) is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that removes phosphate groups from signaling molecules (PMID: 18286234). In its resting inactive state, PTPN11 maintains a conformation that inhibits phosphatase activity (PMID: 18286234). After growth factor or cytokine stimulation of a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), PTPN11 is recruited to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the RTK leading to a conformational change and activation of phosphatase activity (PMID: 18286234, 21575863). PTPN11 regulates multiple signaling cascades and is involved in the negative regulation of the PI3K/AKT (PMID: 14644997), STAT5 (PMID: 23103841) and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways (PMID: 25026279, 24618081). Germline mutations in PTPN11 have been identified in Noonan syndrome and LEOPARD syndrome, while somatic PTPN11 mutations have been identified in several cancers and are prevalent in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) (PMID: 11704759, 16358218). PTPN11 mutations typically occur as missense mutations that disrupt phosphatase activity or have dominant negative function, leading to the activation of signaling pathways that regulate growth (PMID: 21575863). However, both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations can lead to pathway activation, as the open conformation of PTPN11 resulting from mutation matters more for its interaction with other proteins than does its catalytic activity (PMID: 29559584). KRAS-mediated tumorigenesis has been shown to depend on functional PTPN11 protein (PMID: 29808010, 29808006, 29808009).While PTPN11-specific therapies have not yet been developed, small molecule inhibitors targeting members of the RAF and PI3K signaling pathways have been found to be therapeutically effective in the context of PTPN11 loss (PMID: 26365186).",
    "Truncating mutations in PTPN13 result in loss of protein function. In vivo studies have demonstrated that truncation of PTPN13 results in increased growth and invasiveness of breast tumors in mice that lack the PTPN13 catalytic domain compared to wildtype (PMID: 31938048)",
    "PTPN13, a member of the PTP family, encodes for a tyrosine phosphatase that functions in apoptotic regulation (PMID: 15611135). PTPN13 interacts with FAS and NGFR through its phosphotyrosine substrate recognition pocket to negatively regulate pro-apoptotic signaling (PMID: 7536343, 20620960). PTPN13 functions in the regulation of various other cellular physiological processes, including cell-cell adhesion and cellular proliferation, by regulating phosphorylation levels of signaling pathways such as Akt and PI3K (PMID: 32919955, 23604317). Knockdown of PTPN13 in various cancer cell lines and models reduces cell-cell junction stability and cell-cell adhesion, tumor growth and invasiveness, and colony formation and invasion, suggesting that PTPN13 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 31938048, 20501847, 17982484). Downregulation of PTPN13 has been identified in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (PMID: 20501847, 22245727, 32919955). Hypermethylation of the PTPN13 promoter region has also been identified in lymphoma, breast cancer, liver cancer and gastric cancer (PMID: 16572203).",
    "Truncation mutations of PTPN14 typically result in the loss of protein function. In vitro studies with HEK293 cells expressing truncated transcripts of PTPN14 lacking linker regions demonstrate that truncating mutations are inactivating as measured by loss of YAP1 binding, the inability to translocate YAP1 to the cytoplasm from the nucleus and the inability to inhibit anchorage-independent growth compared to wildtype (PMID: 22948661)",
    "PTPN14, a member of the PTP family, encodes for a tyrosine phosphatase that functions in development and the regulation of various cellular processes including cellular proliferation, cellular adhesion and cytoskeleton organization (PMID: 10212280, 10934049). PTPN14 modulates angiogenesis and organogenesis through the TGF-β/BMP pathway and Hippo-YAP pathway (PMID: 22233626, 17893246, 26950094). Knockdown of PTPN14 in various cancer cell lines and models induces cellular proliferation and invasion, suggesting that PTPN14 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 29017057, 32141101, 32645410). Loss of PTPN14 has been identified in various types of cancer, including prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and basal cell carcinoma (PMID: 32645410, 29017057, 33602785).",

    ". Overexpression in PTPN2 null cells leads to decreased JAK1 activity (PMID: 21791476)",
    "PTPN2 (also TC-PTP) is a tyrosine phosphatase that functions as a signaling protein. PTPN2 is highly expressed in immune cells and functions to remove phosphate molecules from proteins, namely protein tyrosine kinases (PMID: 19290937). Many substrates of PTPN2 have been identified including JAK1 (PMID: 11909529), JAK3 (PMID: 11909529), STAT1/6 (PMID: 12138178, 17210636), EGFR (PMID: 11514572, 9488479), and the oncogenic fusion BCR-ABL (PMID: 14966296), among others. Predominantly, PTPN2-mediated dephosphorylation of protein tyrosine kinases results in negative regulation of downstream signaling pathways (PMID: 11514572). PTPN2 can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, which is dependent on numerous factors including the presence of cellular stress (PMID: 11479308). Activity of PTPN2 is required for a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle control (PMID: 11498795), lymphocytic proliferation (PMID: 12847239), lymphocytic lineage specification (PMID: 28798028), insulin signaling (PMID: 20484139), apoptosis (PMID: 21984578) and cytokine sensitivity (PMID: 21115548). PTPN2 also negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling, leading to attenuation of immune responses (PMID: 22080863). Loss of PTPN2 expression in mice results in hematopoietic deficiencies and dysregulation of inflammatory responses (PMID: 9271584, 29444435). Polymorphisms in PTPN2 are associated with autoimmune disorders such as Crohn’s disease, type I diabetes and ulcerative colitis (PMID: 22080863, 22457781, 24445916). Deletions and somatic loss-of-function mutations in PTPN2 have been identified in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PMID: 20473312, 21551237, 21791476). In contrast, PTPN2 expression has been associated with colon cancer promotion due to reduced inflammasome activity (PMID: 29444435). Consistent with this result, deletion of PTPN2 leads to enhanced efficacy of immunotherapies as evidenced in preclinical studies by an activated inflammatory response (PMID: 28723893).",
    "Deletion mutations in PTPRD lead to protein inactivation. Experimental studies using glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and melanoma cell lines containing deletions of PTPRD demonstrate that these alterations are associated with cell growth suppression and apoptosis (PMID: 19074898)",

Specifically, PTPRD contains extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains thus constituting a receptor-like PTP with a role in cell-cell adhesion (PMID: 16557282, 22977525). Identified targets for dephosphorylation by PTPRD include STAT3 and AURKA (PMID: 19478061, 22305495). PTPRD is inactivated in a large number of glioblastomas and is mutated, deleted or promoter methylated in multiple other human cancers, ranging from neuroblastomas to endometrial, lung and colon cancers and has a putative tumor suppressor function (PMID: 25263441, 19478061).",

    "The PTPRS gene encodes the enzyme receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase T (PTPσ), which is a member of the family of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that are involved in various cellular processes. Specifically, PTPRS contains extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains thus constituting a receptor-like PTP. Additionally, PTPRS is considered a member of the leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) subfamily of PTPs, due to its role in development of the nervous system and evolutionary conservation (PMID: 15674434). PTPRS is seldom altered in cancer but its deregulation has been observed in several cancers, such as colorectal, head and neck and ovarian tumors, and it might act as a tumor suppressor through regulation of angiogenic and EMT processes (PMID: 16557282, 25998839, 26308964, 22065749).",
    "Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data showed that hypermethylation of the promoter was observed in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), in breast invasive carcinoma and in colon and lung adenocarcinoma. In HNSCC, hypermethylation of the promoter was associated with downregulation of PTPRT mRNA expression and hyperphopshorylation of its substrate STAT3. Treatment of HNSCC cells with hypermethylated PTPRT with a non specific DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-azacytidine), resulted in demethylation of the PTPRT promoter and subsequently induction of expression of PTPRT protein and dowregulation of phopshorylated STAT3 (PMID: 25982282)",

PTPRT contains extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains, thus constituting a receptor-like PTP with a role in cell-cell adhesion (PMID: 16973135, 16557282). Identified targets for dephosphorylation by PTPRT include cadherins E, N and VE, STAT3, PXN and BCR (PMID: 16973135, 22767509, 20133777). Mutations in PTPRT are found specifically in colon cancer but also in a wide range of other human cancers, including both solid and blood tumors. PTPRT is characterized as a tumor suppressor, as PTPRT mutations in cancer are predominantly loss of function, and PTPRT knock-out mice are hypersensitive to AOM (azoxymethane)-induced colon cancer (PMID: 17223850, 25982282, 15155950, 21517784).",
    "PUM1 is an RNA-binding Pumilio protein of the highly conserved PUF family of proteins, which are important mediators of post-translational gene regulation. These proteins bind to the 3’UTR of target mRNAs, promoting their degradation and thereby controlling their translation (PMID: 18411299, 28232582, 31395860). However, PUM1 has also been shown to mediate transcript-specific post-translational gene activation in certain contexts (PMID: 28232582). Due to its role in regulating gene expression, PUM1 is known to be involved in tumorigenesis, as dysregulated expression of PUM1 can lead to DNA repair damage, chromosomal instability (PMID: 29428722) and may inhibit apoptosis (PMID: 18166083). PUM1 may also regulate innate immunity (PMID: 28760986). In leukemia, PUM1 is known to promote and maintain hematopoietic stem and myeloid leukemia cell growth (PMID: 28232582).",
    "The RAB35 A151T mutation occurs in a residue that is conserved in Ras-like GTPases, and is paralogous to a well-documented KRAS missense mutation A146T. Stable expression of RAB35 A151T variant in NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated growth factor-independent elevation in AKT phosphorylation and caused inhibition of serum starvation-induced apoptosis, as assessed by cleaved Poly Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-Ribose Polymerase (PARP) and cleaved caspase-3 levels. The A151T variant also induced significantly higher number of NIH-3T3 colonies in focus formation assay, compared to wildtype RAB35, indicating oncogenic potential. This in vitro transformation of NIH-3T3 cells due to RAB35 A151T variant was shown to occur in a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner (PMID: 26338797)",
    "RAB35 is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that collectively function in regulating the myriad of membrane transport processes in eukaryotic cells (PMID: 19931531, 20937701, 23060965). RAB35 (also named Ray or Rab1c), interacts with p53-related protein kinase and distributes in the nucleus, cytosol, and cell membrane (PMID: 16600182). RAB35 is an interacting partner for nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) in human lymphoma cells (PMID: 14968112) and mediates Wnt5a-induced migration of breast cancer cells (PMID: 23353182). Through mutual antagonism, RAB35 and ARF6 are geared to reciprocally balance the recycling of integrins and cadherins in order to tune cell adhesive behavior towards cell migration or intercellular contact. Consistent with that, there is a strong reduction in RAB35 expression levels in brain, breast and squamous tumors, which are all associated with EGF receptor overexpression and enhanced ARF6 activity (PMID: 23264734). A clinical investigation demonstrates a significant positive correlation between RAB35 and androgen receptor (AR) expression in ovarian cancer, making RAB35 attractive as a candidate for biomarker of AR function in ovarian cancer (PMID: 19623182). Importantly, RAB35 is a critical regulator of PI3K-AKT signaling that acts upstream of PDK1 and mTORC2 and downstream of growth factor receptors (PMID: 26338797). Expression of two known cancer-related RAB35 missense mutations, RAB35-A151T or RAB35-F161L, resulted in increased AKT phosphorylation, enhanced cell viability, resistance to apoptosis under growth-factor deprivation, and PI3K-dependent transformation, indicative of a gain-of-function effect (PMID: 26338797). Searches of existing human tumor sequencing databases reveal that RAB35 mutations are rare and are therefore unlikely to appear on current lists of human cancer genes that rely solely on statistical methods to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations (PMID: 26338797). Finally, RAB35 is a target gene of miR-720 in HEK293T and HeLa cells, a nonclassical miRNA involved in the initiation and progression of several tumors (PMID: 26413265).",

    "The RAC1 (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1) gene encodes a member of the Rho family of GTPases, which includes RHO, RAC1 and CDC42. Rho GTPases regulate the assembly and disassembly of the cytoskeleton; in this regard, RAC1 plays a role in cell adhesion, differentiation and migration (PMID: 24072884, 17373658). Additionally, RAC1 is involved in pathways governing proliferation (MAPK pathway), the inflammatory response (NFkB pathway) and regulation of the cell cycle (PMID: 24072884, 10816416, 17373658). The activity of RAC1 is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which switch GDP for GTP and trigger catalysis of GTP to GDP, respectively (PMID: 10816416). RAC1 is ubiquitously expressed, and gain-of-function mutations are implicated in processes underlying metastasis and drug-resistance; therefore, RAC1 is a putative drug target (PMID: 22407364, 25056119, 19509242, 24072884, 25594058, 24750242). RAC1 mutations are found predominantly in melanoma, but have also been identified in other cancer types (PMID: 22817889, 22842228, 17904119, 22786680).

RAC2 regulates various cellular processes such as secretion, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell polarization (specifically lamellipodial extension and membrane ruffling), and phagocytosis (PMID: 16949823). RAC2 has been identified as a component of the phagocytic oxidase complex in neutrophils, and a dominant negative mutation (D57N) in RAC2is associated with phagocyte immunodeficiency in humans (PMID: 10961859, 15814684, 21167572). In addition, RAC2 is involved in multiple kinase-mediated signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) signaling networks (PMID: 7664330, 9042860, 10843388). Unlike RAC1 and RAC3, RAC2 is expressed specifically in cells of hematopoietic lineages (PMID: 23850828, 12370311), and RAC2-deficient mice demonstrate cellular defects in multiple hematopoietic lineages, including stem and progenitor cells, neutrophils, mast cells, T and B cells (PMID: 12370311, 11057896, 11320224). Mouse models have revealed a distinct role for RAC2 in promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis (PMID: 24770346) and loss of RAC2 causes a significant delay in the development of BCR-ABL-driven myeloproliferative disorders (PMID: 17996650).",

    "RAD17 is a cell cycle checkpoint chromatin-binding protein that functions as a regulator of cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair in response to DNA damage (PMID: 20424596). When DNA damage occurs in cells, RAD17 is phosphorylated at two conserved serine motifs on its C-terminus by ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases (PMID: 11418864). Phosphorylated RAD17 in turn recruits and activates Claspin to phosphorylate CHK1 to halt mitotic entry and mediate DNA repair and replication (PMID: 16885023, 11090622, 11390642). Loss of RAD17 function promotes tumorigenesis through increased chromosomal aberrations, DNA double-strand breaks and endoreduplication, significantly reducing cell viability (PMID: 12672690).

Within this complex, RAD50 functions as a flexible and dynamic dimer with ATPase activity. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that RAD50 functions in the maintenance of genomic integrity via the bridging of multiple RAD50 molecules to DNA and subsequent recruitment of the MRN complex to damaged chromatin (PMID: 21458667, 21511873, 21441914, 12152085, 25576492). RAD50 also has a direct function in bridging the ends of DNA that are to be repaired via NHEJ (PMID: 15309560).

    "RAD51 is a member of the RAD51 recombinase family that functions in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). RAD51 acts at an early step in the DSB pathway: the 5’ended DNA strands flanking the DSB break site are resected and the single-stranded overhangs are coated by RAD51 forming a nucleo-protein filament (PMID: 25833843). RAD51 then probes for homologous DNA and initiates the process of strand invasion and exchange between homologous DNA (PMID: 19122145, 20930833).

    "RAD51B (also known as RAD51L1) is a member of the RAD51 recombinase family that functions in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). RAD51B, in complex with the central homologous repair protein RAD51, acts at an early step in the DSB pathway: the 5’ended DNA strands flanking the DSB break site are resected and the single-stranded overhangs are coated by RAD51 forming a nucleo-protein filament (PMID: 25833843). RAD51 then probes for homologous DNA and initiates the process of strand invasion and exchange between homologous DNA (PMID: 19122145, 20930833). RAD51B expression is upregulated following ionizing radiation (PMID: 9788630) and RAD51B function is required for the formation of repair complexes including RAD51 paralogs, XRCC2 and XRCC3 (PMID: 11751635, 11283264, 10938124). In addition to the DNA damage repair pathway, RAD51B has been shown to influence cell cycle regulation through phosphorylation of p53, CDK2 and cyclin E, resulting in G1 cell cycle delay (PMID: 10623463). Germline RAD51B variants have been identified as risk factors in familial breast cancer (PMID: 27149063, 21852249, 23001122, 24325915, 25779941, 21852249) and glioblastoma (PMID: 22017238).

    "RAD51C is infrequently mutated in human cancers; however, RAD51C gene expression was reduced in a subset of breast cancer tumor samples (PMID: 23512992). RAD51C (also known as RAD51L2) is a member of the RAD51 recombinase family that functions in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). RAD51C, in complex with RAD51, acts at an early step in the DSB pathway: the 5’ended DNA strands flanking the DSB break site are resected and the single-stranded overhangs are coated by RAD51 forming a nucleo-protein filament (PMID: 25833843). RAD51 then probes for homologous DNA and initiates the process of strand invasion and exchange between homologous DNA (PMID: 19122145, 20930833). RAD51C is a component of two DSB repair complexes, BCDX2 (including RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and XRCC2) and CX3 (including XRCC3), which have roles in damage-stabilization and assembly of RAD51 filaments, respectively (PMID: 16093548, 23149936). RAD51C activity is also important for resolving Holliday junctions (PMID: 17114795, 14716019). Biallelic germline mutations of RAD51C are associated with a Fanconi anemia-like disorder (PMID: 20400963) characterized by developmental defects and predisposition to cancer. In addition, germline mutations in RAD51C confer susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer (PMID: 20400964, 21616938, 21990120, 22538716), as well as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 24315737).",

    "RAD51D (also known as RAD51L3) is a member of the RAD51 recombinase family that functions in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). RAD51D, in complex with RAD51, acts at an early step in the DSB pathway: the 5’ended DNA strands flanking the DSB break site are resected and the single-stranded overhangs are coated by RAD51 forming a nucleo-protein filament (PMID: 25833843). RAD51 then probes for homologous DNA and initiates the process of strand invasion and exchange between homologous DNA (PMID: 19122145, 20930833). Biochemical studies demonstrate that RAD51D forms a complex with three other RAD51 paralogs: XRCC2, RAD51B and RAD51C (known as the BCDX2 complex) (PMID: 10871607, 11751635, 16236763). This complex plays a role in the early stages of HR, prior to recruitment of RAD51 to damaged DNA foci (PMID: 11751635, 21821141). RAD51D also interacts with DNA binding and replication proteins including SFPQ, NONO, MCM2, and MSH2 (PMID: 19658102) and has a role in the telomere maintenance (PMID: 15109494). RAD51D-deficient cells develop spontaneous chromosomal aberrations and exhibit G2 arrest (PMID: 11283264, 21205838, 15781618). Germline mutations in RAD51D confer increased risk for ovarian cancer and breast cancer (PMID: 21822267, 23372765, 1903388, 15170666). RAD51D somatic mutations are rare in human cancers, however, RAD51D variants have been associated with increased chemoresistance (PMID: 1903388).",
    "RAD52 is a recombinase protein involved in RAD51-mediated DNA recombination and repair (PMID: 27649245). RAD52 binds to RAD51, promoting strand exchange during homologous recombination (HR) by pairing of homologous single- and double-stranded DNA (PMID: 27649245). Biochemical studies suggest RAD52 may help recruit RAD51 to double-stranded break (DSB) loci or form RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments (PMID: 10212258, 8550550, 9450758, 8370524). Whereas RAD51 knockout is embryonic lethal in mice, depletion of RAD52 in mice or human cell lines does not render a lethal or DSB-sensitive phenotype (PMID: 9774659, 8943369, 8692798). However, preclinical studies show that inactivation of RAD52 in cells lacking BRCA2, BRCA1, RAD51 paralogs or PALB2 results in synthetic lethality (PMID: 9774659, 22964643, 23071261) indicating that RAD52 has redundant function in RAD51-mediated HR repair pathways (PMID: 22964643, 23071261). Rare germline RAD52 variants have been found in familial breast and ovarian cancer (PMID: 12883740, 10463575, 23188672), however somatic RAD52 mutations in human cancers are infrequent.",

The RAD54L-RAD51 interaction results in supercoiling ahead of replication factor complex movement and the stabilization of the D loops during DNA repair (PMID: 11459989, 16818238). RAD51 binding to single and double-stranded DNA is stabilized by RAD54L during recombination initiation (PMID: 12566442). There is additional evidence that RAD54L can disassociate RAD51 from duplex DNA after recombination has been initiated (PMID: 12453424).

    "RAF1, or CRAF, is one of three RAF serine/threonine kinases that signal in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (PMID: 17555829). In response to extracellular stimuli, RAS-mediated signaling induces the formation of CRAF homodimers or CRAF/BRAF heterodimers leading to phosphorylation of MEK and subsequently ERK, which are signaling effectors in the MAPK pathway. Activation of MAPK signaling stimulates a wide range of cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation and migration (PMID: 21779496). CRAF is ubiquitously expressed and is necessary for normal physiology in several tissues despite partially overlapping functions with ARAF and BRAF (PMID: 9767153). Somatic mutations in RAF1 occur at a low frequency in different cancers, including uterine, stomach, colorectal and malignant melanoma (PMID: 27273450, 24957944). Several RAF1 missense mutations have been shown to be oncogenic, leading to increased MAPK signaling and oncogenic transformation in vitro (PMID: 24569458). Additionally, rare oncogenic RAF1 fusions have been found in different types of cancer (PMID: 19363522, 20526349, 25266736).

    "RARA (retinoic acid receptor alpha) is a transcription factor that plays a role in the differentiation of white blood cells. RARA heterodimerizes with the RXR nuclear receptor and is activated by binding retinoid ligands (PMID: 1310350). Binding of the ligand results in a conformational change and recruits histone acetyltransferases and chromatin remodeling ATPases that activate transcription (PMID: 8274399, 11106744). RARA signaling is involved in the development of multiple tissue types, hematopoiesis, and stem cell specification (PMID: 9053308, 10529422, 24074870). Translocations between RARA and PML is implicated in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (PMID: 23841729).

The absence of RASA1 activity leads to accumulation of GTP-bound RAS and persistent MAP kinase signaling following growth factor stimulation (PMID: 9121432). Somatic alterations in RASA1 map to all regions of the gene, including the C-terminal GAP catalytic domain and the N-terminal tandem SH2-SH3-SH2-PH-C2 domains. The SH2 and SH3 domains have been shown to interact with signaling proteins, including RhoGaps. Statistical analysis of mutational profiles of more than 8,200 tumor data sets identified RASA1 as a candidate driver and a putative tumor-suppressor gene based on a high ratio of inactivating to benign mutations (PMID: 24183448). RASA1 has also been implicated as a potential tumor suppressor in aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and several subtypes of breast cancer (PMID: 25303977, 16570289, 19372580). The highest rates of RASA1 mutations have been reported for prostate adenocarcinoma (13.1%) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (13%) (PMID: 22722839, 25303977). In most cancers somatic alterations in RASA1 are infrequent (e.g. 1.6% across 21 tumor types) (PMID: 24390350). RASA1 plays an essential role in vascular system development, as loss-of-function mutations cause capillary ‘malformation-arteriovenous’ malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) (PMID: 24038909, 22913934).",

    "RB1, also known as RB, is involved in the cell-cycle checkpoint and in its active form inhibits the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle until the cell is ready to divide. RB is active in its unphosphorylated form where it binds to E2F family of transcription factors, which together with the E2F Dimerization Partner (E2F-DP), inhibits the transcription of S-phase promoting factors by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and induce heterochromatin formation (PMID: 1655277). At the end of G1, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) phosphorylate RB to pRB which leads to its dissociation from the E2F-DP complex, thereby allowing entry into S-phase. RB remains phosphorylated until the end of mitosis at which point it is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to activate the G1-S-phase checkpoint (PMID: 20694007). In addition to its role in G1 cell cycle arrest, RB1 has also been shown to play a role in safeguarding genome stability and mediating apoptosis, senescence and differentiation in response to various stimuli (PMID: 22293180). As a result of its role in these essential cellular functions, loss of function of RB1 not only leads to unregulated cell division and growth but also to the abrogation of multiple mechanisms that safeguard against cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Loss-of-function and deletions of RB1 have been associated with many human cancers including lung, breast, prostate and bladder cancers, and concomitant loss of RB1 and p53 are thought to constitute a tumor-initiating event (PMID: 12204530). Homozygous loss or inactivation of the RB1 gene is a hallmark of retinoblastoma (PMID: 22293180), and germline mutations in RB1 and are at an increased risk of retinoblastoma as well as other cancer types (22205104).",
    "RBM10 deletions have been identified as the cause of TARP syndrome is associated with defects in exon splicing due to loss of RBM10 nuclear function and is considered an oncogenic event (PMID: 24000153)",
    ". Similarly, RBM10 mutations in lung cancer is associated with defects in splicing of the NOTCH regulator, NUMB, leading to the promotion of cell proliferation (PMID: 24332178)",
    ". Consistent with this, knockdown of RBM10 in human cancer cell lines enhanced tumor growth in mouse xenograft experiments (PMID: 26853560)",
    ". Additionally, experimental studies have shown that depletion of RBM10 in HeLa cells enhanced cell colony formation; in contrast, overexpression of wildtype RBM10 reduced the clonogenic capacity of A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (PMID: 24332178)",
    "RBM10 encodes a nuclear protein that belongs to a family of proteins with RNA-binding motif. RBM10 is located on the X chromosome and therefore subject to X-inactivation whereby the remaining active allele is widely expressed in human cell lines and tissues (PMID: 11944989, 15514923). Mutations that result in a truncated RBM10 protein are identified as the causes of TARP (Talipes equinovarus, Atrial septal defect, Robin sequence, and Persistent left superior vena cava) syndrome, which has been reported to cause pre- or postnatal death in affected males (PMID: 20451169, 21910224, 24000153). RBM10 was discovered to be among the most frequently mutated genes in lung adenocarcinoma samples (PMID: 22980975, 25079552); mutations in this gene have also been observed in breast, colon, ovary, pancreas and prostate cancers (PMID: 20668451, 16959974). RBM10 has been characterized as an RNA-binding protein both in vitro and in vivo, and identified as an important regulator of alternative splicing (PMID: 24000153, 24332178). Recently, RBM10 has been shown to regulate alternative splicing of FAS and Bcl-X, two genes involved in apoptosis (PMID: 24530524).",

    "RBM15 (also OTT) is an RNA binding protein that is a member of the SHARP family of proteins (PMID: 17376872). RBM15 is a regulator of N6-methyladenosine methylation of RNA, an RNA modification that impacts gene expression (PMID: 17376872). RBM15 binds pre-messenger RNA at introns of important hematopoietic genes, including GATA1, MPL, and RUNX1, and recruits splicing factors to mediate alternative splicing (PMID: 26575292, 25468569). In addition, RBM15 is important in the nuclear export of mRNA via binding to the nuclear receptor NFX1, leading to nuclear envelope localization in order to coordinate messenger ribonucleoprotein binding (PMID: 17001072, 18981216, 19586903, 19786495). RBM15 is also important in the regulation of several cellular functions including X chromosome inactivation, cell fate specification, DNA damage and cellular proliferation (PMID: 26190105). RBM15 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and RBM15 expression restricts the development of myeloid and megakaryocytic cell types (PMID: 17283045). In addition, RBM15 coordinately regulates differentiation in a cell-type specific manner with NOTCH transcriptional activity (PMID: 17283045). Loss of RBM15 expression in murine models results in hematopoietic abnormalities including loss of peripheral B cells and a shift towards myeloid progenitor fate (PMID: 17376872). Recurrent RBM15 translocations are found in patients with acute megakaryocytic leukemia (PMID: 11344311). In addition, somatic loss-of-function mutations in RBM15 have been identified in phyllodes tumors, a benign fibroepithelial neoplasm of the breast (PMID: 29315289).",

    "The RECQL gene encodes a DNA helicase that localizes to sites of DNA damage where mismatch repair factors are also recruited and unwinds the DNA (PMID: 7961977, 8056767, 15886194). The precise mechanisms of action of RECQL are largely unknown, but it is thought to be required for proper DNA replication, DNA repair and genome homeostasis (PMID: 18074021, 20065033, 15886194, 23095637). Alternative functions for RECQL include a role in telomere maintenance (PMID: 24623817). RECQL has been described to regulate genes that promote cell migration and invasion and inhibit apoptosis (PMID: 25424877, 25483193). The RECQL gene is rarely altered in tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016). Germline mutations in RECQL have been associated with breast cancer susceptibility (PMID: 25915596, 25945795).",

    "RECQL4 appears to function both in single-stranded DNA annealing and double-stranded DNA unwinding and is involved in DNA replication and various types of DNA repair, including double-strand break repair, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair and single strand repair (PMID: 20065033, 20222902, 17320201, 18693251, 16949575, 22508716, 19567405). RECQL4 functions as a tumor suppressor. Inheritance of two compromised alleles leads to Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome (RTS), Baller-Gerold Syndrome (BGS), or RAPADILINO syndrome, each a rare syndrome with many overlapping phenotypic features. It has been suggested that the different syndromes are a result of mutations with different effects on the protein product, with certain domains involved in specific pathways (PMID: 20301383, 20113479, 17364146). RTS and RAPADILINO have a cancer predisposition, particularly osteosarcoma. RECQL4 somatic mutations, reported in tumors of numerous tissue types, are found across the gene without any specific hotspot. There is currently no therapy targeted at RECQL4 mutations. Missense mutations make up approximately 69% of all point mutations in RECQL4 in reported tumor samples. These mutations are scattered throughout the gene, include the Sld2 (DNA replicative factor) domain and the conserved RecQ-family helicase domain (PMID: 23238538, 23899764, 20668451, 24332040). Mutations in the Sld2 domain have the potential to affect the initiation of DNA replication (PMID: 25336622). Mutations within the helicase domain may affect the ability of RECQL4 to carry out strand annealing/unwinding functions (PMID: 25336622).",
    "REL encodes a transcription factor in the NF-kappa B family of transcription factors regulating immune function (PMID: 22405852). It is important for the development of regulatory T-cells, B-cell proliferation and survival, and cytokine production (PMID: 19995950, 10049356, 12646638, 12426000). While normally expressed mainly in lymphocytes, it has also been found expressed in various solid cancer types in an oncogenic role (PMID: 18037997, 21933882). Polymorphisms in REL are associated with autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and gastrointestinal autoimmune disorders (PMID: 19503088, 20953190, 21425313). REL is most frequently altered by amplifications seen in both Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas (PMID: 11433522, 12511414, 11830502). It can also be over expressed in lymphomas through translocation with the immunglobulin loci (PMID: 17079453). Mutations that alter REL transactivation activity are rare but have been seen in lymphomas (PMID: 17072339, 1650444, 11921291).

    "RELN (also Reelin) is a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein important in neuronal function (PMID: 27303269). Expression of RELN is highest during brain development and is predominantly secreted from Cajal-Retzius neurons and regions of hypothalamic differentiation (PMID: 9182958). In addition, expression of RELN shifts dramatically postnatally, suggesting different roles of RELN during development and adulthood (PMID: 18477607). Activity of RELN is required for appropriate cell migration, aggregation, synaptic function and dendrite formation (PMID: 27803648). RELN acts as an exogenous ligand that binds the receptors VLDLR and ApoER2, resulting in the phosphorylation of DAB1, a signaling effector molecule (PMID: 27803648). Activation of DAB1 initiates the activity of downstream signaling proteins including PI3K and the Src-family protein Crk (PMID: 18477607). RELN signaling mediates the activity of RAP1-GTP and cofilin, proteins involved in cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton (PMID: 27803648). Loss of RELN in mouse models results in central nervous system defects including aberrant motor coordination, tremors, and altered gait (PMID: 7972007, 7715726). Reduced RELN expression has been implicated in a variety of neurological diseases including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism, among others (PMID: 27092053). Germline RELN mutations are found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorder autosomal recessive lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (PMID: 10973257). Somatic mutations in RELN were identified in patients with T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, adult T-ALL and lung cancers (PMID: 22237106, 25595890, 22980976). Epigenetic silencing of RELN expression via methylation occurs in several cancer types including gastric and hepatocellular cancer (PMID: 19956836, 20734148, 29222813), suggesting that RELN likely functions as a tumor suppressor.",

    "REST (also NRSF or RE-1 silencing transcription factor) is a transcriptional repressor that is a member of the Krüppel-type zinc-finger transcription factor protein family (PMID: 23414932, 15907476). REST functions to suppress the expression of neuronal genes by binding to neuron-restrictive silencer elements (NRSE) (PMID: 15907476). Epigenetic modifying proteins that facilitate gene repression are recruited to chromatin by REST, including CDYL1, EHMT2, HDACs, and SIN3a, among others, to inhibit neuronal gene expression (PMID: 10491605, 15200951, 28286748, 10734093). REST activity has been implicated in the restriction of neuroendocrine cell fate, including in neuroendocrine tumor types such as small cell lung and prostate cancer (PMID: 28489825, 28256535, 24163104). REST also regulates various cellular functions including stemness, invasion, proliferation, hypoxia, neuronal function and embryonic development (PMID: 28256535, 27531581, 28286748). Germline mutations in REST are associated with Wilm’s tumor, a pediatric cancer that affects the kidney (PMID: 26551668). Epigenetic silencing of REST expression is implicated in neurodegenerative disease and in cancer (PMID: 29351877). Somatic truncating mutations and deletions in REST have been identified in several cancer types, including colorectal cancer, suggesting that REST predominantly functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 15960972, 23414932). However, increased REST activity is found in neuronal cancers, such as glioblastomas, medulloblastomas and neuroblastomas, suggesting that REST activity may be context-dependent (PMID: 23414932).",

    "RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds ligands of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family and transmits intracellular signals via the pro-oncogenic mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (PMID: 24561444). RET is normally expressed in the developing embryo, playing a particularly important role in neural and neuroendocrine lineages (PMID: 8306871). In cancer, RET can be activated either through point mutations or gene rearrangements with a variety of translocation partners resulting in constitutively active cytosolic oncoproteins (PMID: 24561444). Heritable activating mutations in RET lead to the highly penetrant familial cancer syndromes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A: medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B: medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, multiple mucosal neuromas and intestinal ganglioneuromas, marfanoid habitus) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) (PMID: 15322516). Oncogenic somatic mutations include point mutations and genomic rearrangements of the RET locus leading to inversions or translocations. These have been identified in various cancers including papillary thyroid cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). In addition, aberrant expression or activation of wildtype RET correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer and endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer (PMID: 24561444).",

    ". REV3L overexpression demonstrated resistance against treatment with cisplatin as measured by attenuated cisplatin-induced apoptosis in treated U251MG and U87MG glioma cell lines (PMID: 19289490)",
    "REV3L, also known as POLZ, encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta and functions in translesion DNA synthesis (PMID: 9618506). The catalytic activity of REV3L requires interaction with the non-catalytic subunit of polymerase zeta, REV7, and the scaffolding protein, REV1, to allow assembly of translesion DNA polymerases at sites of DNA damage (PMID: 22859296). REV3L maintains genomic stability and proliferation of cells in response to DNA damage, however, accumulation of DNA damage occurs as a result of REV3L-mediated proliferation (PMID: 11050391, 12805232). The expression level of REV3L varies in a variety of cancer tissues (PMID: 11115544) and cell lineage plays a large role in dictating the oncogenic function of REV3L alterations. Amplification of REV3L has been identified in various cancers, including glioma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and cervical cancer (PMID: 19289490, 26752104, 18593951). Overexpression of REV3L in cervical cancer cells promotes tumorigenesis as measured by increased cell growth and tumor colony formation (PMID: 25781640). Loss of REV3L has been identified in various cancers, including colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer (PMID: 18622427, 15617831). In vitro studies examining the deletion of REV3L have had conflicting results on the effects on cancer cell growth. REV3L inhibition in HeLa cells demonstrated no effect on tumorigenesis as measured by no alteration in colony growth or survival, however other studies using cervical cancer, lung, breast, mesothelioma and colon tumor cells demonstrated suppressed colony growth (PMID: 20028736, 22028621). Polymorphisms of REV3L resulting in loss of REV3L function have been identified in non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and mesothelioma (PMID: 22349819, 21455670, 24956248).",
    "Amplification of RHEB has been found in breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell cancer (PMID: 20388784)",
    ". In vivo studies with mice overexpressing RHEB demonstrate RHEB amplification is activating as measured by constitutive mTOR signaling activation and tumor development compared to wildtype mice (PMID: 20388784)",
    "RHEB encodes a small GTPase within the RAS superfamily that functions as a molecular switch by activating the mTOR pathway (specifically, mTORC1) when bound to GTP (PMID: 24863881). Specifically, RHEB is thought to enact its activation upon mTORC1 via affecting the substrate affinity of mTORC1 for 4EBP1, a downstream effector of the mTOR pathway, resulting in protein synthesis activation (PMID: 19299511). RHEB is negatively regulated by the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2) which functionally activates the GTPase activity of RHEB causing exchange of the RHEB-bound GTP for GDP thus preventing RHEB from activating mTORC1 (PMID: 18708577). The TSC1/TSC2 complex is frequently mutated in human cancers, which allows for RHEB-associated upregulation of the mTOR pathway (PMID: 18708577, 15240005). RHEB is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is localized to the lysosomal membrane along with mTORC1 and the TSC1/TSC2 complex (PMID: 24863881, 14614311). Beyond its role in the regulation and activation of the mTORC1 complex, RHEB has been suggested to have multiple other non-canonical functions, including regulation of BRAF, as well as being important in developmental functions (PMID: 24863881, 21412983). RHEB has also been postulated to play a context-dependent role in the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy (PMID: 24216995). RHEB is not a commonly mutated gene in human cancer, although hotspot, activating mutations have been discovered within the effector domain in a small number of renal cell carcinomas and endometrial cancers (PMID: 24390350, 24631838, 2015). RHEB has, however, been shown to be overexpressed in multiple cancer types, including liver, lung, prostate, lymphoma and bladder cancer, and RHEB overexpression has been postulated to be associated with poor outcomes in breast cancers and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (PMID: 18708577, 18708578, 20388784). This overexpression may result in part from copy number gains (RHEB is located at 7q36) or focal amplifications, which occur in numerous cancer types including ovarian (12%, cbioportal March, 2015). RHEB overexpression has been proposed to be a biomarker for response to mTOR pathway inhibitors (rapalogs), although clinical evidence for this is lacking at this time (PMID: 18708578, 24631838).",

    "If the Oncogenic Mutations occur at RHOA, could lead ton Angioimmunoblastic T-Cell Lymphoma",
    "The RHOA gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed small GTPase protein that primarily localizes to the cytoplasm. RHOA cycles between an active, guanosine triphosphate (GTP) bound, and an inactive, guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound state. Proteins known as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) facilitate activation and inactivation of RHOA respectively. RHOA mediates several cellular functions by activating a number of downstream effectors, including the ROCK-cofilin pathway which stimulates cell motility by causing actin stress fiber formation and contractility (PMID: 25660168). RHOA plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis by mediating invasion of tumor cells, and inhibition of RHOA signaling has shown anti-tumor effect in preclinical models (PMID: 21622195, 25728708, 20364104, 25333508). On the contrary, recent studies have shown that several oncogenic RHOA mutations lead to inactivation of the protein, and RHOA deletion is more common than RHOA amplification in some tumors, suggesting a complex and potentially context-dependent role of RHOA in cancer (cBioPortal, MSKCC, April. 2015; PMID: 24413737, 24816253).",

RICTOR is an upstream kinase for several AGC kinase family members, including AKT/PKB, PKC (protein kinase C) and SGK1 (serum-glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase-1). In response to growth factors, mTOR2 phosphorylates and activates these kinases to regulate cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation and survival (PMID: 22350330, 15268862, 15718470, 18566586, 18925875, 17141160, 18566587). Included in the mTORC2 targets is AKT, a key component in the pro-oncogenic PI3-kinase signaling pathway that regulates various cellular functions including cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis (PMID: 25505994, 15718470). RICTOR also associates with factors independent of mTOR (PMID: 20832730, 18339839, 18426911), and some of the less well-characterized mTOR-independent functions of RICTOR include regulation of cell morphology, migration and protein degradation (PMID: 21670596). Overexpression of RICTOR is positively associated with tumor progression and poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 25371154), endometrial carcinoma (PMID: 24966915), pituitary adenoma (PMID: 23898069) and gastric cancer (PMID: 26159923).

These proteins function as binary molecular switches; in response to external stimuli, they exchange GDP with GTP, thereby triggering several intracellular signaling networks. RIT1 is widely expressed in adult and embryonic tissue, including primary neurons and the developing brain. It plays a central role in the induction of neuronal differentiation through activation of both the BRAF/ERK and the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways (PMID: 15632082, 11914372). Additionally, RIT1 plays a role in regulating axonal versus dendritic growth, and it contributes to IFNγ-induced dendritic retraction (PMID: 17460085, 12668729, 18957053). RIT1 has been identified as a regulator of a p38/MAPK-dependent cascade that functions as a prosurvival mechanism in response to oxidative stress (PMID: 21737674, 21444726, 23123784).

    "The ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 90 kDa, polypeptide 4 (RPS6KA4, also known as MSK2 or RSK-B), is a serine/threonine protein kinase, composed of two kinase domains, the N and C-terminal kinase domains and acts as an important downstream effector of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (PMID: 9003374, 7498520). Many growth factors, peptide hormones, and neurotransmitters regulate RPS6KA4 through Erk1/2 signaling (PMID: 10411321, 10610536). Knockdown of RPS6KA4 gene expression leads to upregulation of p53 transcriptional activity and its overexpression results in the inhibition of p53 target promoters and p53-mediated apoptosis, indicating that RPS6KA4 has a p53-inhibiting function (PMID: 16929179, 19797274). Moreover, the antitumoral effect of α-Lipoic acid (α-LA) on colorectal cancer cells stems, at least partially, from its property to prevent RPS6KA4-mediated p53 inhibition (PMID: 23599020). MAPKs play a major role in UV-induced skin cancer development and a phospho-MAPK array analysis indicated that p38α and its downstream target proteins, MSK2 and HSP27, were strongly activated by UVB and SUV (PMID: 23382047). RPS6KA4 is also known as MSK2 (human mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 2) and shares 64% homology with MSK1. Activated MSK1/2 is known to induce cellular transformation in various cell lines; for instance, following induction by EGF and TPA, MSK1/2 activation leads to cellular transformation of mouse epidermal cells (JB6 cells) (PMID: 18381464). The role of MSK1/2 in cellular transformation also involves its ability to activate various transcription factors such as CREB, ATF1, ER81, and the p65 subunit of NFκB, which in turn activate the transcription of genes involved in tumorigenic and metastatic progression (PMID: 22983151). MSK1/2 also mediate chromatin remodeling that is required at the enhancer and upstream promoter element for TPA-induced initiation of TFF1 expression in MCF-7 breast cancer epithelial cells (PMID: 23675462). Finally, an exciting new study reported that MSK1/2 is involved in an in vivo model of skin tumor development (PMID: 21314333). Mice lacking MSK1 and 2 exhibit reduced skin tumor formation by tumor promoting agents 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and TPA in a multistage skin carcinogenesis model compared to wild-type mice. As such, MSK1/2 as a key regulator of expression of several oncogenes presents a potential target in chemotherapeutic development (PMID: 21314333). Inhibition of MSK1/2 can be achieved by cell permeable molecules that have varying degrees of potency and selectivity.

Genetic variations in RPS6KB2 are associated with Alzheimer disease (PMID: 21811019). S6K2 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels found in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and central nervous system; levels in normal tissues are relatively low, compared with levels in corresponding tumor samples (PMID: 21444676, 16810323). High levels of S6K2 are found in adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer and gastric cancer (PMID: 15627062, 21748818, 15995633, 15627061, 20953835, 16810323, 23393338). Expression and localization of RPS6KB2 are distinguishing features of cancer cells (PMID: 15627062). Amplification of RPS6KB2 has prognostic value and can help predict treatment success in breast cancer. In endometrial and gastric cancers, the level of nuclear expression of RPS6KB2 correlates with tumor grade and decreased overall survival. In lung cancer, increased expression of S6K2 is correlated with drug resistance (PMID: 15627062, 21748818, 15995633, 15627061, 20953835, 16810323). Somatic mutations are found in lung adenocarcinomas in nonsmokers and are associated with worse survival (PMID: 24894543). Polymorphisms in RPS6KB2 are associated with a risk of developing colon cancer and rectal cancer (PMID: 21035469).",
    "RPTOR (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR) encodes a scaffolding protein that regulates the assembly, localization and substrate binding of mTORC1. mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) is an atypical serine-threonine protein kinase that belongs to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family (PMID: 19339977). It interacts with several proteins to form two distinct complexes named mTOR complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2). RPTOR/raptor is a unique member of the mTRORC1 complex and serves as a scaffolding protein and is essential for mTORC1 complex activity (PMID: 25450580, 14684181, 26159692). mTORC1 is a key regulator of protein synthesis (PMID: 19339977). RPTOR binds to the translational regulator 4E-BP1 and mTORC1 then directly phosphorylates 4E-BP1, which, in turn, promotes protein synthesis (PMID: 19339977, 15718470). mTORC1 also controls the synthesis of lipids required for proliferating cells to generate membranes (PMID: 19948145). The mTOR pathway is of great importance in cancer pathogenesis (PMID: 25450580). Many components of the pathway upstream of mTORC1 are mutated in human cancers (PMID: 22500797). Derivatives of rapamycin (rapalogs) that potently inhibit mTOR activity are tested in different cancer types some of which are clinically approved (PMID: 21490404).",
    "The RRAGC gene encodes a guanine-binding protein of the RAG family of GTPases; it acts as a heterodimer with RRAGCA or RRAGCB (PMID: 24095279). RRAGC targets mTORC1, a complex that responds to growth factors and various other stimuli to positively regulate cell growth that is frequently deregulated in cancer. Specifically, RRAGC regulates the intracellular localization of mTORC1 and facilitates its RHEB-dependent activation (PMID: 20381137, 27234373). RRAGC missense mutations are found in follicular lymphomas (PMID: 26691987).",
    "The RRAS Q72H mutation is located in the GTP/GDP binding domain of the protein and is a statistically significant hotspot. In vitro studies with NIH3T3 cells expressing RRAS Q72H demonstrate that the mutation is activating as measured by increased transforming activity compared to wildtype (PMID: 36476833)",
    "RRAS (also R-Ras) is a small GTPase protein belonging to the RRAS subfamily of Ras-like GTPases. RRAS regulates diverse cellular processes including angiogenesis, vascular homeostasis, vascular regeneration, cell adhesion and neuronal axon guidance (PMID: 28610953). In addition, RRAS regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and promotes the formation of ruffling lamellipodia via its activation of phospholipase Cε (PMID: 16537651). RRAS mediates cell adhesion, cell spreading, cell polarization and phagocytosis via Integrin β1 activity (PMID: 8620538, 18270267, 11257001). Loss of RRAS expression in mice results in vasculature defects, highlighting the importance of RRAS in the hematopoietic system (PMID: 27029009). Germline mutations in RRAS are found in disorders related to Noonan Syndrome collectively called \"RASopathies\" and rare somatic alterations have been associated with hematologic and pediatric cancers (PMID: 24705357).",
    "The RRAS2 G23V mutation is located in the P-loop of the protein. This mutation has been shown to lead to a constitutively active gene product, with a subsequent increase in PI3K pathway activity and tumorigenesis (PMID: 24826867)",
    "RRAS2 (also TC21) is a small GTPase protein belonging to the RRAS subfamily of Ras-like GTPases. RRAS2 primarily localizes to the plasma membrane and activates the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and JNK signaling cascades (PMID: 10557073, 11850823). Interaction of RRAS2 with c-Raf initiates these downstream signaling pathways and mediates transformation and differentiation of diverse cell types (PMID: 10557073, 11850823). Functional experiments have demonstrated that RRAS2 can function as an oncogene, as engineered gain-of-function mutations have high levels of transforming activity and induce transcriptional activation from Ras-responsive promoter elements (PMID: 8196649). Oncogenic mutations in RRAS2 are occasionally found in tumor cell lines (PMID: 8052619, 7478545) and RRAS2 amplification is found in many cell lines derived from breast cancer (PMID: 8552388); however, RRAS2 alterations are relatively rare in human cancers.",

    "RTEL1 (Regulator of telomere length1) encodes a DNA helicase implicated in telomere length regulation, DNA repair, and maintaining genomic stability. The helicase activity of RTEL1 is essential in disassembling telomere loops and suppressing telomere fragility to maintain the integrity of chromosome ends (PMID: 24115439). In addition, it interacts with proteins in the shelterin complex known to protect telomeres during DNA replication (PMID: 23959892). It also acts as an anti-recombinase to affect the disassembly of toxic DNA recombination intermediates, and thus regulates meiotic recombination and crossover homeostasis (PMID: 18957201). Germline mutations in this gene have been associated with dyskeratosis congenital (PMID: 23329068) and Hoyerall-Hreidarssonsyndrome (PMID: 23959892).",

    "RUNX1, also known as AML1 or CBFA2, is a transcription factor that is a master regulator of hematopoietic differentiation. It interacts with a diverse subset of transcriptional complexes and can act as a transcriptional activator via recruitment of histone acetyltransferases or methyltransferases (PMID: 18695000, 22012064), or a repressor via recruitment of histone deacetylases or Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) (PMID: 21059642, 22325351). Due to its important role in hematopoiesis, conditional deletion of RUNX1 in mice results in an expansion of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor population, and defective T- and B-lymphocyte development (PMID: 14966519). RUNX1 is highly regulated via alternative splicing, ubiquitination, phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation, which has important regulatory consequences in cancer (PMID: 19386523). RUNX1 is frequently translocated and altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and Familial platelet disorder with predisposition for acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML) (PMID: 17290219, 15156185, 21174539). Many translocations involving RUNX1 lack the activation domain, and have a leukemogenic effect by acting as a dominant negative inhibitor of wild-type RUNX1 in transcription activation (PMID: 15156182).",
    "RUNX1T1 (also ETO, MTG8, CBFA2T1) is a transcription factor that is a member of ETO/MTG family of proteins (PMID: 15649458). RUNX1T1 functions as a transcriptional repressor and interacts with several complexes involved in silencing of gene expression, including the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR), silencing-mediator for retinoid/thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), mSin3a, and histone deacetylases (PMID: 9724795, 9819404, 9819405, 9724795). In addition, RUNX1T1 co-binds CEBPA, a transcription factor associated with tissue-specific differentiation programs (PMID: 19811452). RUNX1T1 is expressed in normal heart and brain tissues and is not highly expressed in hematopoietic lineages (PMID: 9661669, 9209371). Functional studies of RUNX1T1 activity have been predominantly completed in the context of leukemic fusion proteins; therefore, further work is necessary to study the cellular functions of wildtype RUNX1T1. The RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or t(8;21) fusion (most commonly termed AML-ETO fusion) is the most frequent translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 8338940). In this fusion protein, the RUNT homology domain of the RUNX1 gene on chromosome 21 is fused to the entirety of the RUNX1T1 gene on chromosome 8 (PMID: 11607817). The AML-ETO fusion protein is insufficient to drive leukemia in murine models and human leukemias, suggesting that a second mutational hit is required for leukemogenesis (PMID: 22875638, 26666262). This translocation functions as an oncogene by enhancing self-renewal in hematopoietic stem cells and mediating transcriptional activity via the recruitment of epigenetic complexes to target genes (PMID: 28299657, 11607817).",
    "RXRA encodes the Retinoid X Receptor Alpha, which is a member of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily of transcriptional regulators. RXRA functions either as a homodimer or as a heterodimeric partner for a number of nuclear receptors. RXRA/PPARA (Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor- alpha) heterodimers regulate PPARA-mediated transcriptional activity on genes involved with fatty acid oxidation, such as the cytochrome P450 system genes (PMID: 10195690). RXRA also heterodimerizes with the thyroid hormone receptor (T3R), Vitamin D3 receptor (VD3R) and Retinoic Acid Receptors (RARs). RXRA is required for forming stable complexes of these receptors with their cognate DNA response elements and for transactivation of genes regulating growth, differentiation, metabolism, homeostasis and neoplasia (PMID: 1314167, 1310351). In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) driven by PML/RARA fusion protein, RXRA is deemed essential for APL pathogenesis in vivo, even though PML/RARA can complex with DNA and transform primary hematopoietic progenitors ex vivo (PMID: 17613434). RXRA deficiency causes hyperplasia and aberrant differentiation of skin epidermis and prostate epithelium (PMID: 11171393, 12183441).",
    "RYBP is a tumor suppressor and truncating mutations in this gene are assumed to be oncogenic. RYBP directly interacts with MDM2 and decreases p53 ubiquitination, leading to stabilization of p53 and an increase in p53 activity. RYBP induces cell-cycle arrest and is involved in the p53 response to DNA damage, and its loss of expression may thus be important in cancer disease progression (PMID: 19098711)",
    "The RYBP (RING1 and YY1 binding protein) protein is a Polycomb group protein that is involved in transcriptional regulation. RYBP is part of the Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and interacts directly with RING1, RNF2, and YY1, to mediate H2A ubiquitylation at specific polycomb target sites to repress these genes (PMID: 22325148). It has been show to play an important role in development and stem cell programming through its role in transcriptional repression (PMID: 10369680). RYBP also has polycomb-independent roles, and can act as a tumor suppressor through interaction with MDM2 and subsequent stabilization of TP53 (PMID: 19098711). The genetic locus of RYBP is frequently deleted in prostate cancers and loss of RYBP expression has been detected in hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer and is associated with poor outcome (PMID: 20579941, 25344099, 26404750).",
    "SAMHD1 deletion mutations typically result in the loss of protein expression. In vitro studies with SAMHD1-knockdown THP-1 cells demonstrate that loss of SAMHD1 is inactivating as measured by increased cellular proliferation, increased G1/G0 phase cell population, increased dNTP and reduced apoptosis compared to vector control (PMID: 27183329)",
    "SAMHD1 (also AGS5 and Mg11) is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase involved in cellular dNTP homeostasis (PMID: 28502830). SAMHD1 converts dNTPs, the nitrogenous bases that are required for DNA synthesis, into deoxynucleosides after stimulation by dGTP, leading to depletion of the dNTP pool (PMID: 28502830, 22056990). The activity of SAMHD1 is regulated by the concentration of dNTPs, which allosterically bind SAMHD1 to regulate tetramerization and catalytic activity (PMID: 28502830, 25760601). In addition, SAMHD1 may also have ribonuclease activity; however, this finding is controversial (PMID: 25038827, 26101257). SAMHD1 has been implicated in additional cellular functions including innate immunity and DNA end resection during DNA repair (PMID: 19525956, 28834754). SAMHD1 is also a restriction factor that renders myeloid and dendritic cells refractory to HIV infection by hydrolyzing intracellular dNTPs in non-cycling cells, decreasing the dNTP pool required for DNA synthesis (PMID: 21613998, 22926205). Germline mutations in SAMHD1 are found in patients with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that aberrantly activates the immune system and resembles congenital infection (PMID: 19525956). Somatic SAMHD1 mutations are found in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 24335234). SAMHD1 is predicted to function as a tumor suppressor as mutations in SAMHD1 result in reduced protein expression (PMID: 24335234). Expression of SAMHD1 can also result in resistance to nucleoside-based chemotherapies by hydrolyzing the active triphosphate metabolites, namely in acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 28502830, 27991919).",
    "SCG5 (also Secretogranin V or 7B2) is a secreted chaperone protein that is a member of the granin family (PMID: 2053134, 21862681, 22947085). SCG5 is predominantly expressed in neuroendocrine tissues and functions to reduce the aggregation of other secreted proteins (PMID: 21862681, 22947085). In addition, SCG5 activates the proprotein convertase (PC2) enzyme which initiates neuroendocrine peptide maturation by facilitating transport of protein precursors through the endoplasmic reticulum and secretory pathway (PMID: 11719503, 11439082, 10799554, 9881669). Additional studies have identified SCG5 as a β-cell associated antigen that is recognized by naïve CD8-positive T-cells (PMID: 30078552). Aberrant SCG5 activity has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and mediates amyloid-β and α-synuclein aggregation (PMID: 23172224). Germline duplications involving a region including SCG5 and GREM1 are found in patients with hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome and these alterations may be associated with colorectal cancer risk (PMID: 27984123, 22561515, 18084292).

SERPIN proteins predominantly function by disrupting the active sites of proteases and forming irreversibly covalent SERPIN-protease complexes (PMID: 27637160). Specifically, SERPINB3 mainly targets papain-like cysteine proteases such as Cathepsin L, S, and K and papain (PMID: 27637160).

SERPINB3 has been implicated in stress responses, autoimmunity, and apoptosis due to altered surface antigen presentation (PMID: 19332150, 23325331, 25111616, 19332150). SERPINB4 expression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types; however, functional experiments have not yet delineated if SERPINB4 functions as a tumor suppressor or oncogene (PMID: 17291250, 27637160, 30376194). Somatic mutations in SERPINB4 are found in patients with cutaneous melanoma, and these alterations are associated with improved survival following immune checkpoint blockade therapies (PMID: 26091043, 27668655). Improved responses to immunotherapy may be due to the ability of mutated SERPINB4 to serve as an epitope, leading to enhanced immune recognition (PMID: 27668655).",

    "SET, also known as template activating factor-Iβ (TAF-Iβ), is a multi-functioning protein that acts as a template activating factor, histone chaperone and phosphatase 2A inhibitor (PMID: 34021475). SET is involved in DNA replication through processes such as transcription, nucleosome assembly and chromatin remodeling (PMID: 34021475). As a subunit of the inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) complex, SET inhibits the activity of histone acetyltransferase and exerts chaperone activity by binding to core histones, specifically histone 3 and histone 4 (PMID: 34021475, 17360516). Inhibiting the acetylation of nucleosomes is an important event in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (PMID: 11163245). The SET complex, composed of SET and granzyme A-activated endonuclease NH23-H1, also regulates apoptosis following the attack of cytolytic T cells and NK cells (PMID: 1618237). In response to superoxide generated by granzyme A, the SET complex translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus and regulates apoptosis through the inhibition of phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a major mammalian protein serine-threonine phosphatase, which is a tumor suppressor that inhibits cell proliferation via the dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 (PMID: 34021475, 862667). Impaired regulation of PP2A by SET loss may lead to acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 8626647), and translocations involving the SET gene are found in various forms of acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 34021475, 8626647).",

    "SETBP1 is a DNA binding protein that functions as an epigenetic remodeler (PMID: 28881700). Binding of SETBP1 to proteins with SET domains, typically present in histone methyltransferases, allows for the methylation of substrates, including histone tails (PMID: 25306901). SETBP1 activates gene expression in part by mediating the recruitment of the HCF1/KMT2A/PHF8 epigenetic complex to regions of chromatin (PMID: 29875417). In addition, SETBP1 binds the protein SET, an inhibitor of the phosphatase PP2A, and overexpression of SETBP1 results in reduced PP2A expression and leukemic proliferation (PMID: 19965692). In preclinical studies, SETBP1 has been shown to mediate self-renewal in leukemia cells and to regulate the expression of the HOXA gene cluster (PMID: 22566606, 25306901). Expression of SETBP1 is also associated with organ development and neuronal activation (PMID: 29875417). Germline mutations in SETBP1 have been identified in patients with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome, a congenital disorder that presents with neurological symptoms and increased risk of malignancy (PMID: 28346496, 20436468). Somatic SETBP1 mutations are found in patients with hematopoietic malignancies, including myeloproliferative neoplasms and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (PMID: 23832012, 23222956). Alterations in SETBP1 occur in a hotspot region that is within a degron motif that facilitates substrate recognition by the SCF-β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase. These mutations disrupt SETBP1 degradation by the E3 ligase complex, suggesting that SETBP1 functions as an oncogene (PMID: 29875417, 28346496).",
    "SETD1A (also KMT2F, hSET1, SET1A, SET1) is a histone methyltransferase that is a member of the MLL family of trithorax-related chromatin remodeling enzymes (PMID: 18838538, 25550471). SETD1A modifies histone tails by trimethylating histone H3 at lysine 4, resulting in an epigenetic signal that is associated with actively transcribed genes or genes poised for transcription (PMID: 18838538, 24126056). Histone proteins, essential components of the nucleosome, consist of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones), and histone tail modifications provide signals for the activation or repression of gene expression (PMID: 11498575). The formation of an epigenetic complex including CFP1, RBBP5, ASH2, WDR5, and WDR82 is required for effective SETD1A enzymatic modification of histone tails (PMID: 17998332). SETD1A shares substantial homology with SETD1B, however, these two methyltransferases have non-redundant functions in the regulation of gene expression (PMID: 17355966). In addition, the SETD1A complex binds to RNA polymerase II and influences the initiation of transcription (PMID: 17998332). SETD1A also interacts with several additional chromatin-modifying enzymes that influence gene expression and chromatin state (PMID: 18765639, 20622854, 23353889). The activity of SETD1A is required for many stages of development including embryonic and neural stem cell survival, maternal oocyte gene expression and hematopoietic lineage specification (PMID: 24550110, 28619824, 27141965, 23754954, 25550471). In addition, SETD1A has been implicated in the maintenance of stalled replication fork and the regulation of DNA repair pathways with implications for genome stability (PMID: 29937342, 29348130). Loss-of-function mutations in SETD1A are found in patients with schizophrenia and developmental disorders (PMID: 26974950, 24853937). SETD1A is overexpressed in several cancer types and has been shown to promote cell proliferation and survival in functional studies (PMID: 19426701, 24247718, 25373480, 29474905).",

Microdeletions and mutations in SETD1B have been associated with disorders that result in intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities (PMID: 27106595, 29322246). Somatic fusion proteins and mutations have been identified in several tumor types including hematopoietic malignancies, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and endometrial cancers, among others (PMID: 24925220, 24670651, 24382738, 27997699, 29967129). These SETD1B mutations predominantly occur as nonsense and/or frameshift mutations, suggesting that SETD1B may function as a tumor suppressor.",

    "SETD2 encodes a chromatin modulating enzyme that functions by site specific trimethylation of histone H3K36. It was originally identified as a contributing enzyme in the pathogenesis of Huntington Disease and thus was initially named Huntington Interacting Protein B (HYPB) (PMID: 9700202). Histone methylation is a highly controlled biological process that regulates gene expression by altering the ability of RNA polymerase II to interact with DNA and thus initiate transcription (PMID: 16118227, 25123655). Additionally, the SETD2-regulated H3K36 histone mark has been shown to play a role in regulating DNA mismatch repair. This suggests that inactivation of this protein can lead to enhanced genetic instability, enrichment of nonsense and frameshift mutations and ultimately oncogenic transformation of cells (PMID: 23622243, 25123655, 25728682, 24931610). Importantly, SETD2-mutant renal tumors failed to activate the p53 tumor suppressor, thus providing an alternative pathway for the inactivation of p53 that leads to defects in DNA damage repair (PMID: 24843002).",

    "SETD3 is a histone methyltransferase that is a member of the SET domain family of chromatin remodeling enzymes (PMID: 21832073). SETD3 modifies histone tails by methylating histone H3 at lysine 4 and lysine 36, resulting in an epigenetic signal that is associated with actively transcribed genes or genes poised for transcription (PMID: 21832073). Histone proteins, essential components of the nucleosome, consist of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones), and histone tail modifications provide signals for the activation or repression of gene expression (PMID: 11498575). SETD3 is ubiquitously expressed and also binds and methylates non-histone substrates including PCNA, a protein involved in DNA replication (PMID: 26030842) and FOXM1, a protein involved in hypoxia (PMID: 27845446), among others. The activity of SETD3 is important in mediating muscle differentiation by activating the expression of muscle-associated genes (PMID: 21832073). Expression of SETD3 has been associated with oncogenesis and metastasis in several tumor types (PMID: 28442573, 29099276).

    "SETD4 is a histone methyltransferase that is a member of the SET domain family of chromatin remodeling enzymes (PMID: 24738023). SETD4 modifies histone tails by tri-methylating histone H4 at lysine 20 as evidenced in model organisms, however, the specific methyltransferase activity of SETD4 has not yet been determined in mammalian studies (PMID: 28031330). Histone proteins, essential components of the nucleosome, consist of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones), and histone tail modifications provide signals for the activation or repression of gene expression (PMID: 11498575). SETD4 has been shown to be overexpressed in breast cancer cells that are estrogen receptor negative (PMID: 24738023). Knockdown of SETD4 expression in breast cancer cells results in reduced proliferation and cell cycle progression (PMID: 24738023). Infrequent SETD4 mutations have been identified in human cancers; however, additional functional experiments are necessary to determine the impact of these alterations (cbioportal, September 2018).",
    "SETD5 is a histone methyltransferase that is a member of the SET domain family of chromatin remodeling enzymes (PMID: 24680889). SETD5 is predicted to methylate histone tails to regulate gene expression, however, the specific methyltransferase activity of SETD5 has not yet been determined in mammalian studies. Histone proteins, essential components of the nucleosome, consist of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones), and histone tail modifications provide signals for the activation or repression of gene expression (PMID: 11498575). SETD5 interacts with the PAF1 co-transcriptional complex and the NCor-associated histone deacetylase complexes. Loss of SETD5 expression results in increased histone acetylation at transcriptional start sites, suggesting a role in histone deacetylation (PMID: 27864380). SETD5 deletion in murine models results in developmental defects including cardiac defects, aberrant neural tube development, and altered vascular structure (PMID: 27864380). Germline mutations in SETD5 have been associated with human disorders that result in intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities (PMID: 23613140, 24680889, 24768552, 28120103).

    "SETD6 is a histone methyltransferase that is a member of the SET domain family of chromatin remodeling enzymes (PMID: 23324626). SETD6 modifies histone tails by monomethylating histone H2AZ, a histone variant, at lysine 7 (PMID: 23324626). Histone proteins, essential components of the nucleosome, consist of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones), and histone tail modifications provide signals for the activation or repression of gene expression (PMID: 11498575). The H2AZK7me1 mark is found at chromatin locations also marked by H3K27me3, a repressive mark, suggesting that this mark reduces gene expression in embryonic stem cells (PMID: 23324626). SETD6 can also methylate non-histone proteins including PAK4 and RELA (PMID: 26841865, 21131967), leading to altered WNT and NF-KB signaling, respectively. SETD6 monomethylates RELA, a component of the NF-KB signaling pathway, resulting in a methylated protein that binds chromatin at RELA target genes (PMID: 21131967). The methylated RELA protein reduces chromatin accessibility at NF-KB target genes, leading to a restrained NF-KB inflammatory response (PMID: 21131967, 21515635). In addition, SETD6 has been implicated in oxidative response pathways and maintenance of embryonic stem cells (PMID: 26780326, 23324626). SETD6 is overexpressed in some tumor types, including breast cancer; however, SETD6 is infrequently altered across human cancers (PMID: 24751716, 28122346).",
    "SETD7 (also SET7, SET9, SET7/9) is a histone methyltransferase that is a member of the SET domain family of chromatin remodeling enzymes (PMID: 11779497). SETD7 modifies histone tails by methylating histone H3 at lysine 4, resulting in an epigenetic signal that is associated with actively transcribed genes or genes poised for transcription (PMID: 11779497, 11850410, 12540855). Histone proteins, essential components of the nucleosome, consist of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones), and histone tail modifications provide signals for the activation or repression of gene expression (PMID: 11498575). In addition to methylation of histone substrates, SETD7 can also methylate non-histone substrates in order to regulate their stability or functional activity. SETD7 methylates P53 in a mechanism that restricts P53 to the nucleus leading to transcriptional stabilization and activation (PMID: 17646389, 18280244, 21855806). SETD7 also stabilizes the estrogen receptor and NF-KB for recruitment to transcriptional targets (PMID: 18471979). In addition, SETD7 methylates DNMT1 (a DNA methyltransferase), E2F1 (a cell cycle factor involved in regulating DNA damage-induced cell death), and YAP (a transcription factor involved in WNT regulation), among others (PMID: 19282482, 19684477, 21151116, 20603083, 27046831). Somatic mutations in SETD7 are rare in human cancers; however, SETD7 has been implicated as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene in different cellular contexts (PMID: 26848522, 26779630, 26701885, 26116705, 27183310).",

SETDB1-dependent H3K9me3 methylation results in the recruitment of HP1-alpha, leading chromatin remodeling to a more heterochromatic state (PMID: 11959841). In addition, SETDB1 binds protein complexes implicated in transcriptional repression including KRAB-KAP1 and MDB1-CAF1 (PMID: 11959841, 15327775). SETDB1 also interacts with several proteins involved in sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, and homologous recombination (PMID: 18501190, 26206670) and mediates gene repression in embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells (PMID: 19884255, 21624812, 27301860). SETDB1 can also regulate the activity of other epigenetic complexes involved in the repression of gene expression, including Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) (PMID: 26160163). SETDB1 can methylate non-histone substrates including p53, which leads to recognition and degradation of P53 by MDM2 (PMID: 26471002). SETDB1 has been identified within a melanoma susceptibility locus and SETDB1 expression promotes melanoma formation (PMID: 26471002, 21430779). In addition, SETDB1 is recurrently amplified in melanoma and lung cancer (PMID: 21430779, 23770855). Somatic mutations, fusion events, and splice alterations are found in mesothelioma, leading to protein inactivation, suggesting that SETDB1 can function as either a tumor suppressor or oncogene in distinct cellular contexts (PMID: 26928227, 26824986).",

Histone proteins, essential components of the nucleosome, consist of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones), and histone tail modifications provide signals for the activation or repression of gene expression (PMID: 11498575). SETDB2 functions to recruit HP1-alpha to centromeres and maintains heterochromatin states in repetitive elements and centromere-associated repeats, implicating SETDB2 in chromosome condensation (PMID: 20404330). SETDB2 is also important in the regulation of acute immune responses, is activated during viral infection, and may mediate bacterial infection susceptibility (PMID: 27572307, 25419628). Homozygous deletions in SETDB2 have been identified in breast cancer (PMID: 25537518); however, somatic alterations in SETDB2 are relatively rare in human cancers.",

    "SF3B1 (splicing factor 3b subunit 1) is a component of the spliceosome complex that regulates the removal of introns from messenger RNA (PMID: 28958291). SF3B1 binds to nucleosomes to identify exon and intron junctions of coding genes (PMID: 25892229). Importantly, SF3B1 preferentially regulates alternative splicing and 3’ splice site selection (PMID: 28445500). In addition, SF3B1 plays a role in the maintenance of genomic integrity due to contributions to sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation (PMID: 25257310). Somatic mutations in SF3B1 are recurrent in uveal melanoma (PMID: 26842708) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (PMID: 21909114, 21995386), especially those with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (PMID: 21995386, 21998214). Mutations in SF3B1 lead to altered gene expression and aberrant alternative splicing (PMID: 25428262) and tend to be missense mutations rather than nonsense or frameshift mutations, suggesting either gain-of-function or dominant negative activity (PMID: 22150006, 21909114). The SF3B spliceosome complex can be inhibited by naturally occurring compounds, including spliceostatin A (PMID: 17643111), and SF3B1-mutant cells are preferentially sensitive to spliceosome inhibitors (PMID: 29457796).",
    "SF3B2 encodes for subunit 2 of the splicing factor 3b protein (SF3B) complex, which functions in pre-mRNA splicing (PMID: 27720643). The SF3B complex assembles with 12S RNA to form the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (U2 snRNP) to bind pre-mRNA upstream of the intron branch site (PMID: 12234937). Haploinsufficiency of SF3B2 has been associated with sporadic and familial craniofacial microsomia (PMID: 34344887). Knockout of SF3B2 in cancer cell lines and models suppresses tumor growth and cellular migration and invasion, suggesting that SF3B2 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 35715826, 34611311). Amplification of SF3B2 has been identified in various types of cancer, including prostate cancer, bladder cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 31431456). SF3B2 is suggested to confer resistance to AR-targeting therapy in prostate cancer by promoting AR-V7 expression through RNA splicing (PMID: 31431456).",
    "SFRP1 deletion mutations typically result in the loss of protein expression. In vivo studies with SFRP1-knockout cancer stem cells and mice demonstrate that loss of SFRP1 is inactivating as measured by increased tumorigenic potential, earlier tumor initiation and upregulation of genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, stemness, proliferation and metastasis compared to wildtype (PMID: 31928951)",
    "SFRP1 is an extracellular signaling ligand that is a member of the secreted frizzled-related protein family (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). SFRP1 functions as a negative regulator of the WNT signaling pathway by binding to WNT or Frizzled (Fz) receptors and precluding WNT-mediated activation of downstream signaling (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). WNT signaling is a critical developmental pathway with roles in determining cell fate, tissue identity and polarity (PMID: 28218291). SFRP1-mediated antagonism of WNT results in the activation of the β-catenin destruction complex (containing APC, GSK3β, and AXIN) which targets β-catenin for degradation (PMID: 23258168). In the absence of WNT signaling, TCF and LEF transcription factors form a repressive complex, leading to inhibition of β-catenin target genes (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). In addition, SFRP1 activity has been linked to the regulation of stress-related senescence, proliferation and metastasis (PMID: 22927647, 11593386, 24316024). Somatic mutations in SFRP1 are not well studied in human cancers; however, epigenetic silencing of SFRP1 transcription has been implicated in several cancer types, including breast cancer (PMID: 28218291, 11992124, 16449975, 11593386). SFRP1 loss of heterozygosity has also been identified in some cancer types, including colorectal cancer, suggesting that SFRP1 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 10086345, 22927647).",
    "SFRP2 is an extracellular signaling ligand that is a member of the secreted frizzled-related protein family (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). SFRP2 functions as a negative regulator of the WNT signaling pathway by binding to WNT or Frizzled (Fz) receptors and precluding WNT-mediated activation of downstream signaling (PMID: 24316024, 23258168).

In the absence of WNT signaling, TCF and LEF transcription factors form a repressive complex, leading to inhibition of β-catenin target genes (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). In addition to roles in antagonizing WNT, SFRP2 associates with integrin complexes and mediates cell adhesion (PMID: 14709558). SFRP2 is secreted by stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as by aging fibroblasts, and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer (PMID: 14999144, 14709558, 16791480, 27042933). Somatic mutations in SFRP2 are not well studied in human cancers; however, epigenetic silencing of SFRP2 transcription has been implicated in several cancer types, including prostate and colorectal cancer (PMID: 22175903, 25197341, 27659069, 31516566, 26291085). SFRP2 is more commonly overexpressed in other cancers and associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that SFRP2 may function as either a tumor suppressor or oncogene (PMID: 14999144, 14709558, 28218291, 30385632).",
    "SGK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that is a member of the AGC family of protein kinases (PMID: 28236975). SGK1 (serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase) is activated by growth factors and is a signaling effector in the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase signaling pathway (PI3K) (PMID: 8455596, 10357815). In the PI3K signaling pathway, SGK1 is phosphorylated and activated by the kinases PDK1 and mTORC2 (PMID: 10357815). SGK1 regulates the expression of a variety of downstream targets including NDRG1, GSK3β, FOXO3, NEDD4L, and PIKFYVE, among others (PMID: 11154281, 10191262). AKT and SGK1 signaling have some overlapping upstream and downstream effectors and SGK1 can partially compensate for AKT activity (PMID: 29055016). In addition, SGK1 increases the activity of a variety of ion channels, ion carriers and the Na+/K+ ATPases; therefore, salt levels and other environmental stimuli are predicted to activate SGK1 activity (PMID: 23467085). SGK1 signaling has been implicated in a variety of other cellular functions including cellular proliferation, apoptosis, membrane protein turnover, regulation of cell volume, transcription and macrophage recruitment (PMID: 22556335, 28236975, 9114008). Somatic gain-of-function mutations in SGK1 are found in patients with nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) and T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (PMID: 26658840, 30213827). In addition, overexpression of SGK1 is found in patients with breast cancer (PMID: 16246546). SGK1 signaling mediates resistance to PI3Kα and AKT inhibition due to compensatory regulation of mTORC1 signaling (PMID: 27451907, 23581296).",

    "SH2B3 (also LNK) is a plasma membrane-associated adaptor protein that negatively regulates signal transduction initiated by growth factor and cytokine receptor kinases (PMID: 11805142, 18753636). SH2B3 is most highly expressed in hematopoietic cells and negatively regulates the activity of several hematopoietic kinases including c-Kit, MPL (thrombopoietin receptor), JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2), PDGFR (Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor, and EPOR (erythropoietin receptor). Deletion of SH2B3 in murine models results in abnormal hematopoiesis characterized by expansion of the hematopoietic progenitor population (PMID: 11805142). SH2B3-regulated signaling has been implicated in B-cell development, T-cell activation, and hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation (PMID: 11114373, 10799879, 11805142). Germline mutations in SH2B3 are associated with autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, celiac disease and hypertension (PMID: 19430479, 18311140, 19073967) as well as predisposition to leukemia (PMID: 23908464). Somatic SH2B3 alterations are found in Down syndrome-related myeloid disorders, acute lymphoblastic leukemias and myeloproliferative neoplasms (PMID: 24056718, 22897847, 20404132, 22237106) and these mutations are predicted to result in loss-of-function.",

SLAM receptors are expressed on hematopoietic cells and regulate lymphocyte activity (PMID: 18031694). SH2D1A competes with the recruitment of signaling molecules such as SHP-2 phosphatase and also functions as a scaffold to recruit Fyn kinase (PMID: 12458214). Recruitment of SH2D1A is important for the regulation and development of B-cells, NK cells, and T-cells including humoral immunity, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity (PMID: 15711562, 20153220, 15774582, 12529646). SH2D1A plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis and mediates lymphocyte proliferation via the apoptotic pathway (PMID: 19738428). Germline mutations and deletions in SH2D1A are associated with X-linked immune dysfunction, susceptibility to EBV infection, and lymphoproliferative disease (PMID: 9771704).

Although the mechanism of action is unknown, it is known that SHQ1 plays an integral role in ribosomal RNA and telomerase RNA processing and metabolism, and loss of function of this protein can lead to a decrease in small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) levels and to defects in ribosomal RNA processing (PMID: 19019820, 19383767)",
    "SHQ1 (H/ACA ribonucleoprotein assembly factor) is located on chromosome 3p13. SHQ1 is suggested to function in rRNA processing and has been shown to be involved in the formation of a protein-RNA complex (snoRNP [small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein]) known as the H/ACA box (PMID: 19383767, 12228251). The H/ACA box is involved in processing of rRNA, modifications of species of RNAs, and stabilization of telomeres (PMID: 20227365, 19383767). SHQ1 are shown to bind NAP57, which is an essential member of H/ACA, prior to the binding of another accessory protein, NAF1, and is thought to assist in the shuttling of the complex to nucleoli (PMID: 20227365, 19383767). SHQ1 contains a protein-protein interaction domain known as the CS domain (named after CHORD-containing proteins and SGT1) which appears to be essential for H/ACA complex formation (PMID: 19426738, 19019820).

Major signaling pathways that are regulated by SLC9A3R1 include the PI3K/AKT pathway as well as PDGFR, EGFR, and Wnt/ꞵ-catenin signaling (PMID: 33965858, 29846905, 28684865, 28068322). SLC9A3R1 regulates transporters and channels through actin-binding ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) proteins (PMID: 28068322). The role of SLC9A3R1 in cancer depends on its cellular location, acting as a tumor suppressor when localized in the cell membrane and as an oncogene when expressed in the cytoplasm or nucleus of cancer cells, where it participates in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process (PMID: 33965858, 29846905, 28684865).

SLFN11 couples IFN-γ to the DNA repair pathway and loss of SLFN11 dampens T-cell responses (PMID: 30753225). Expression of SLFN11 predicts for sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors, alkylating agents, and DNA synthesis inhibitors in cancer cell line datasets and in clinical studies (PMID: 22460905, 22927417, 29906251, 27708213). In small cell lung cancer, SLFN11 expression is repressed in models of chemoresistance due to chromatin-mediated silencing (PMID: 26658330). Expression of SLFN11 predicts for improved survival in a variety of cancer types including small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and Ewing sarcoma, among others (PMID: 25779942, 22927417, 26525741, 26625211, 27440269, 27923837). Rare somatic mutations in SLFN11 are found in patients with Ewing sarcomas (PMID: 26179511). In addition, SLFN11-deficient cells are sensitive to ATR inhibition due to dependency on that pathway for DNA repair (PMID: 27708213, 29395061).",
    "SLIT2, a member of the Slit family, encodes for a secreted glycoprotein that primarily functions in regulating cellular migration through binding to ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors to activate the SLIT/ROBO signaling pathway (PMID: 32807784, 35550611, 34181595). SLIT2 is proteolytically processed into C-terminal fragments (SLIT2-C) and N-terminal fragments (SLIT2-N), which both function in promoting chemotaxis through regulation of chemoattractants and increasing cell migration speed (PMID: 10102266, 30510066). The oncogenic function of SLIT2 is likely tissue-specific. Knockdown of SLIT2 in various cancer cell lines and models induces cellular migration and invasion, suggesting that SLIT2 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene in these tissue-specific contexts (PMID: 30648543, 18611862, 34093772, 25490006). Downregulation of SLIT2 has been identified in various types of cancer, including gastric cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer (PMID: 24297051, 20068157, 34400395). Hypermethylation of the SLIT2 promoter region has also been identified in chronic myeloid leukemia and non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 36411451, 35053460). Conversely, upregulation of SLIT2, along with ROBO1 upregulation, has been observed in osteosarcoma, colorectal cancer, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (PMID: 21283129, 29523788, 22366001). Overexpression of SLIT2 has been identified to promote tumorigenesis by inducing tumor cell migration and invasion in these tissue-specific contexts (PMID: 24840330, 17268810).",

    "The SLX4 protein is involved in various processes related to DNA damage repair. SLX4 localizes at double-strand breaks (DSB) on DNA where it forms a multi-protein complex by recruiting proteins involved in DNA repair and genome stability, such as ERCC1/ERCC4 and SLX1 endonucleases, MSH2/MSH3 mismatch repair complex, and telomeric TRF2, among others (PMID: 19596235, 19596236, 19595721, 19595722). SLX4 is essential for several types of DNA repair including DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), Holliday junction (HJ) resolution and telomere homeostasis (PMID: 24938228). The SLX4 protein is mutated at low frequencies in various tumors, and germline mutations in the gene are the cause of a subtype of Fanconi anemia (FANCP) (PMID: 21240275, 21240277). SLX4 was studied as a putative genetic factor in familial non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer patients, but several studies failed to demonstrate its contribution (PMID: 22911665, 22401137, 21805310, 23211700).",

TGFß signaling controls multiple biological processes including cellular proliferation, differentiation and tissue homeostasis (PMID: 22992590, 11057902). SMAD signaling molecules are activated by membrane receptor serine kinases following binding of TGFß superfamily of cytokines (e.g. TGFß1, TGFß2, TGFß3, activin and nodal) (PMID: 25935112, 9759503). Following dimerization and activation of TGFß receptors, two phosphorylated receptor-regulated SMAD proteins, including SMAD2, form a trimeric complex with a co-SMAD, such as SMAD4, to allow for binding to DNA (PMID: 9759503). The SMAD trimeric complex can translocate to the nucleus and regulate TGFß-mediated gene transcription in a cell-type dependent manner specified, in part, by the availability of transcriptional co-activators and chromatin accessibility (PMID: 22992590, 9759503). The contextual nature of TGFß-dependent transcription allows the TGFß pathway to suppress tumorigenesis in premalignant states and promote invasiveness and metastasis during cancer progression (PMID: 22992590, 18662538, 20495575).

    "SMARCB1 (INI1, BAF47, SNF5) is present in all known variants of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, and is thus considered a core subunit (PMID: 10078207). SWI/SNF complexes are ATP dependent nucleosome remodelers which are required for efficient accessibility of genes to the transcriptional machinery (PMID: 14964309). SWI/SNF complexes are important for normal human development and are required for the transition of transcriptional programs during cellular differentiation(PMID: 23568486). In cancer, SMARCB1 acts as a strong tumor suppressor. It is mutated in rhabdoid tumours, familial schwannomatosis, small-cell hepatoblastomas, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, undifferentiated sarcomas, epitheliod sarcomas, meningiomas and poorly differentiated chordomas (PMID: 9671307, 21057957, 17357086, 18985717, 18580682, 18997735, 15899790, 20930055). Heterozygous SMARCB1 mutations are found in patients with rhabdoid predisposition syndrome, which is characterized by the inheritance of a defective SMARCB1 allele followed by the loss of the remaining allele in the tumours (PMID: 10521299). Mouse models of SMARCB1 mutations recapitulate the tumor suppressor functions observed in humans (PMID: 11095756, 12450796, 16301525). The exact mechanism by which SMARCB1 loss leads to malignant transformation is not yet well understood, however, expression analyses have shown that one consequence of SMARCB1 loss is the activation of gene expression programmes that are associated with proliferation and dedifferentiation (PMID: 21076395). Recently, it was found that SMARCB1 mutant cells depend on the PRC2 component EZH2 which has lead to clinical trials of EZH2 inhibitors in patients with SMARCB1 mutant cancers (PMID: 21654818, 20951942, 26552009, 23620515).",
    "The SMARCD1 gene encodes the protein SMARCD1, (SWI/SNF related, Matrix associated, Actin dependent Regulator of Chromatin, subfamily D, member 1) also known as BAF60A (BRG1-Associated Factor 60A). The SMARCD1 protein is a member of the SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable) complex, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that alters the location or conformation of nucleosomes by using the energy of ATP hydrolysis and thus can regulate transcription of certain genes. To this end, SMARCD1 interacts with a wide repertoire of transcription factors including Oct3/4, Sox2, Sox10, c-Fos/c-Jun, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, vitamin D receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, retinoid-related orphan receptor α, androgen receptor and recruits them to the SWI/SNF complex (PMID: 11053448, 12917342, 14698202, 18680712, 19762545, 20508149, 21725993, 22334693). SMARCD1 is required for Tbx1-driven expression of Wnt5a, a non-canonical Wnt ligand that promotes cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer (PMID: 22438823, 17079465). Moreover, SMARCD1 interacts directly and indirectly with key regulators of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, which in some cases maintains pluripotency (PMID: 19279220) and in other cases restricts it (PMID: 25818293). A series of recent studies showed that SMARCD1 is a direct target of tumor-suppressive miRNA (micro RNAs), namely miR-99 in prostate cancer (PMID: 21212412), miR-490-3p in gastric and ovarian cancer (PMID: 25503559, 25819031) and miR-100 in breast cancer stem-like cells (PMID: 25217527). On the other hand, tumor-suppressive properties of SMARCD1 have been reported; interaction between SMARCD1 and p53 is required for p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (PMID: 18303029) and SMARCD1 is frequently inactivated by truncating mutations in breast cancer (PMID: 22722201). It becomes therefore obvious that the function of SMARCD1 in carcinogenesis is complex and context-dependent.",
    "SMARCE1 (also BAF57) is a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (PMID: 28391084, 21654818, 26601204).

The SMARCE1 subunit has the ability to bind cruciform structures in DNA which might lead to SWI/SNF targeting to sites with distinct chromatin architecture (PMID: 26601204, 27149204). In addition, SMARCE1 is predicted to have a role in mediating chromatin relaxation and disassembly of the SWI/SNF complex (PMID: 27149204). SMARCE1 also has roles in lymphocyte development and in both androgen and estrogen-mediated transcription (PMID: 12110891, 16769725, 18559499, 23493350). Familial alterations in SMARCE1 are found in patients with Coffin-Siris syndrome, a developmental disorder (PMID: 25168959, 31273213). Germline loss-of-function mutations in SMARCE1 are also found in almost all patients in non-NF2 driven spinal meningiomas (PMID: 23377182, 26601204). In human cancer, somatic mutations in SMARCE1 are rare (PMID: 26601204).

    "SMC1A (also SMC1L1) is an ATPase that is a member of the SMC family of proteins. SMC1A functions as a subunit of the cohesin complex that aligns and stabilizes sister chromatids during metaphase (PMID: 24854081). Cohesion between sister chromatids is initiated during DNA replication and must be maintained throughout mitosis or meiosis to ensure proper chromosome-spindle attachments (PMID: 26903600). The cohesin ring that encircles sister chromatids is comprised of two large structural proteins, SMC1A and SMC3, and this ring opens and closes through the binding of alpha-kleisin subunits to the RAD21 and STAG adapter proteins (PMID: 24854081, 22885700). The cohesin complex also functions to maintain chromatin looping structures or 3D arrangements of DNA that allow for regulatory control of gene expression (PMID: 19468298). SMC1A localizes to chromatin sites bound by the insulator protein CTCF, which inhibits tissue-specific enhancer-promoter interactions (PMID: 19468298, 23704192). Germline mutations in SMC1A have been identified in patients with cohesinopathies, including Cornelia de Lange syndrome, leading to a spectrum of developmental defects (PMID: 17221863, 17273969, 18996922).

Mutations in SMC1A are predicted to be loss-of-function and impact the association of SMC proteins with chromatin (PMID: 18996922). Alterations in SMC1A are also predicted to be initiating events in acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 22932223).",
    "SMC3 is an ATPase that is a member of the SMC family of proteins. SMC3 functions as a subunit of the cohesin complex that aligns and stabilizes sister chromatids during metaphase (PMID: 24854081). Cohesion between sister chromatids is initiated during DNA replication and must be maintained throughout mitosis or meiosis to ensure proper chromosome-spindle attachments (PMID: 26903600). The cohesin ring that encircles sister chromatids is comprised of two large structural proteins, SMC1A and SMC3, and this ring opens and closes through the binding of alpha-kleisin subunits to the RAD21 and STAG adapter proteins (PMID: 24854081, 22885700). The cohesin complex also functions to maintain chromatin looping structures or 3D arrangements of DNA that allow for regulatory control of gene expression (PMID: 19468298). SMC3 localizes to chromatin sites bound by the insulator protein CTCF, which inhibits tissue-specific enhancer-promoter interactions (PMID: 19468298, 28467304). Loss of SMC3 in murine models results in aberrant hematopoietic stem cell function and altered expression of genes important in lineage commitment (PMID: 26438361). Germline mutations in SMC3 have been identified in patients with cohesinopathies, including Cornelia de Lange syndrome, leading to a spectrum of developmental defects (PMID: 17221863, 17273969, 18996922, 25655089). Somatic mutations and deletions in SMC3 have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), bladder cancers, and additional hematopoietic malignancies, among others (PMID: 23955599, 24335498, 24056718, 18299561, 28152414, 27470916, 27207471).

    "SMG1 is a serine/threonine kinase that is a member of the Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase family (PIKK) (PMID: 11544179). SMG1 is an essential protein that regulates nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a process that removes incorrect mRNAs that contain premature translation termination codons, and hence encode for aberrant proteins (PMID: 11544179). SMG1 phosphorylates UPF1, an ATPase and RNA helicase involved in NMD, and binds additional proteins involved in mRNA surveillance (PMID: 11544179, 12554878, 18160036). UPF1 and SMG1 form a complex with translation release factors and function as a translation termination complex (PMID: 19417104). SMG1 activity is required for various cellular functions including cell cycle progression, mRNA export, translation, DNA repair, genome stability, apoptosis, and telomere maintenance (PMID: 16199763, 16488880, 16861888, 18326048, 18332866). In addition, NMD or disruption of SMG1 mRNA surveillance activity can lead to alternative splicing to circumvent premature translation termination codons (PMID: 17693403, 20566848). Loss or overexpression of SMG1 results in accumulation or degradation of mRNAs with premature termination codons as demonstrated in functional experiments (PMID: 11544179). NMD can exacerbate developmental disorders that result in mRNAs with premature translation termination codons, such as Ullrich’s disease, and inhibition of SMG1 can restore some normal cellular function (PMID: 16807116). SMG1 is infrequently mutated in human cancers, however, heterozygous loss of SMG1 in murine models results in tumor formation (PMID: 23277562) suggesting that SMG1 functions as a tumor suppressor. Expression of SMG1 is found in several tumor types including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (PMID: 22247495, 25257528). In kinase screens, SMG1 was identified as a possible target in multiple myeloma (PMID: 19996089).",

    "Smoothened (SMO) is a conserved signal transducer of the hedgehog signaling pathway, playing important roles in normal embryonic and neuronal development as well as tumorigenesis (PMID: 23719536, 21614026, 26912893). SMO is a seven-transmembrane domain protein bearing some structural and functional similarity to G-protein coupled receptors (PMID: 23636324). SMO activity is normally inhibited by patched (PTCH1), an upstream component of the Hedgehog pathway, via poorly understood mechanisms (PMID: 23719536). Binding of extracellular Hedgehog ligands to PTCH1 leads to consecutive activation of SMO, which in turn induces modifications of the downstream GLI transcription factors leading to their activation. Activating mutations in SMO lead to constitutive activation of GLI-mediated transcription of important oncogenic genes. Such mutations have been implicated in sporadic basal cell carcinoma (PMID: 9422511, 26950094) and medulloblastoma (PMID: 21614026) and have been identified in many other tumor types. Recent efforts have been made to specifically target SMO (PMID: 26781311, 26931153, 26919418, 26843616, 26527777). A distinct set of mutations in the ligand binding pocket of SMO, however, has been described to confer resistance to SMO inhibitors such as vismodegib and related cyclopamine drugs (PMID: 25759014, 26960983).",

SMYD3 itself is part of the RNA polymerase complex, present on genes being actively transcribed (PMID: 15235609, 22419068). SMYD3 activity induces cell proliferation, migration and carcinogenesis in various in vitro and in vivo cancer systems via transcriptional activation of different target genes (PMID: 15235609, 25980436, 24174655, 22194464).

SOCS1 binds the phosphotyrosines on receptor and non-receptor kinases to mediate inhibition of cytokine signaling (PMID: 10064597). In addition, SOCS1 can target proteins for degradation via the SOCS box domain (PMID: 9202125). Regulation of cytokine signaling by SOCS1 is important for effective immune regulation and lymphocyte development (PMID: 10490100, 14499118, 12433373, 16415872, 24086733). Somatic loss-of-function SOCS1 mutations have been found in Hodgkin’s lymphoma and primary mediastinal lymphomas (PMID: 17652621, 23296022, 19734449).

    "SOCS3 is an adaptor protein that suppresses cytokine signaling and functions in negative feedback inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (PMID: 17525754). SOCS3 binds phosphotyrosines on receptor and non-receptor kinases to mediate inhibition of cytokine signaling (PMID: 10064597, 24600449). Namely, SOCS3 negatively regulates the activity of the JAK non-receptor tyrosine kinase family, leading to reduced translocation of activated STAT3 transcription factor complexes to the nucleus (PMID: 22342841, 24600449, 22566904). In addition, SOCS3 can target proteins for degradation via interactions with E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (PMID: 29712772, 25939384). Regulation of cytokine signaling by SOCS3 is an important mediator of various cellular functions including immune homeostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and survival (PMID: 24069550, 24600449, 22566904). Somatic mutations in SOCS3 are relatively rare in human cancer; however, epigenetic silencing of SOCS3 transcription has been identified in several hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors including mantle cell lymphomas, myeloproliferative neoplasms and prostate cancer, among others (PMID: 23432547, 26216197, 18440067, 20717995). Deletion of SOCS3 in myeloid suppressor populations in the tumor microenvironment also promotes tumor progression in solid tumors, due to dampening of anti-tumor immune responses (PMID: 26967393, 25649351, 29626115).",

The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in many biological processes including embryonic development to stem cell maintenance. For example, conditional ablation of SOX17 in mouse uterine tissue resulted in inhibition of endometrial adenogenesis and a loss of reproductive capacity (PMID: 27102016). Interestingly, conditional deletion of SOX17 from mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) led to the loss of fetal and neonatal but not adult HSCs, proving its importance in the maintenance of fetal and neonatal HSCs but not adult HSCs (PMID: 17655922).",

    "SQSTM1 (or p62) is a stress-inducible adaptor protein that regulates the activation of various signaling pathways such as the Nrf2, mTORC1, NF-kB and autophagy signaling pathways via feedback loops (PMID: 22264792, 20452972, 21617040, 24462201, 21258367, 24011591). Multiple kinases, including mTORC1 and MEKK3, phosphorylate SQSTM1 and allow it to bind to ubiquitin-associated proteins (PMID: 24011591). Phosphorylated SQSTM1 then sequesters or degrades via selective autophagy proteins that negatively regulate important signaling pathways, thus activating these pathways (PMID: 25609235). Examples of this are the binding of KEAP1, the negative regulator of Nrf2, or the binding of the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, the negative regulator of NF-kB (PMID: 28842501). SQSTM1, therefore, serves as a regulator for diverse cellular processes such as inflammatory response, antioxidant response, anabolism and catabolism (PMID: 21981924, 10747026, 20173742, 24462201). Accumulation of SQSTM1 promotes tumorigenesis through the overactivation of these cellular processes (PMID: 27345495, 24332042, 27246794). SQSTM1 translocations have been identified in a variety of tumor types including papillary thyroid cancer, ALK-positive large B-cell lymphoma, adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 28351223, 21134980, 20851865, 33768710).",

    "SRC encodes the c-SRC proto-oncogene, a non-receptor tyrosine protein kinase implicated in cell cycle control, cytokinesis, cell survival/ proliferation and migration/motility (PMID: 25662515). Furthermore, c-SRC has been strongly correlated with a variety of human malignancies including colorectal and breast cancer among others (PMID: 19581523). The c-SRC protein consists of a N-terminal myristolation sequence, important for membrane localization and subsequent functionality, followed by an unique SH4 domain, a SH3 domain, a SH2 domain, a linker to the protein-tyrosine kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain (PMID: 8672527). c-SRC is closely related to nine additional non-receptor tyrosine kinases that share homology with c-SRC, the SRC Family Kinases (SFK), which exert similar functions and are also implicated in human cancers (PMID: 25207369, 24948875, 24574860, 24522479, 24388104, 24361441).",

    "SRSF2 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2) is an RNA splicing factor that mediates constitutive or alternative splicing of pre-mRNA (PMID: 25965569). As a member of the spliceosome, SRSF2 interacts with splicing factors and mediates mRNA splicing by binding to pre-mRNA via an RNA recognition motif (PMID: 22262462). Loss of SRSF2 expression in cell lines and murine hematopoietic models results in abnormal differentiation, cell cycle, apoptosis and mis-splicing of target mRNAs (PMID: 25965569). SRSF2 has also been implicated in the nuclear transport of mRNAs to and from the nucleus (PMID: 22262462). Somatic mutations in SRSF2 have been found in myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia and myeloid disorders (PMID: 21909114, 25550361, 25231745, 26464169, 23660863). Alterations in SRSF2 are predominantly heterozygous missense mutations that impact the RNA recognition domain (PMID: 26261309). SRSF2 mutations result in aberrant pre-mRNA splicing at differential splicing enhancer sequences leading to exon misrecognition (PMID: 26124281, 25965569). In hematopoietic cells, key regulatory genes such as EZH2 are mis-spliced in cells with SRSF2 mutations, leading to degradation of EZH2 (PMID: 25965569). Inhibitors of the spliceosome are in preclinical and clinical testing and may be a therapeutic strategy in spliceosome-mutant disease (PMID: 26575690).",

Co-purification studies have confirmed that SS18 is specifically part of the BAF-type SWI/SNF complexes (PMID: 22442726, 11734557). SWI/SNF complexes remodel chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner to re-position and/or facilitate the binding of transcriptional activator proteins to nucleosomes (PMID: 11734557). The proteins of SWI/SNF complexes are known to be mutated and/or altered in multiple types of cancer due to the potential oncogenic effects of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation.",
    "STAG1 (also SA-1) is a subunit of cohesin, a multi-protein complex that mediates sister chromatid separation during cell division. Cohesin is a ring-shaped structure that regulates sister chromatid cohesion at the centromere from DNA replication to prometaphase during both meiosis and mitosis (PMID: 12034751, 19822671, 21444719). STAG1, or the homolog STAG2, in collaboration with SMC1A, SMC3, and RAD21, make up the cohesin ring-structure that surrounds chromatin (PMID: 24856830). During metaphase, cohesin subunits are released from chromosomes leading to the dissolution of cohesion between sister chromatids (PMID: 19056890). STAG1 also binds CTCF, a protein that mediates chromatin looping and has been implicated as a regulator of insulator regions (PMID: 18550811, 27219007). The cohesin complex is also important for other cellular functions including mediating epigenetic state and transcription in post-mitotic cells and regulation of the DNA damage response (PMID: 19056890). Germline mutations in STAG1 are found in cohesinopathies, developmental syndromes associated with loss of cohesin activity (PMID: 28119487). Loss of STAG1 in mice results in transcriptional changes consistent with Cornelia de Lange syndrome and other cohesinopathies (PMID: 22415368). Somatic mutations in STAG1 have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 24335498) and these mutations are predicted to be loss-of-function (PMID: 28430577). STAG1 overexpression has also been identified in several human cancers (PMID: 11568975). STAG1 and STAG2 have a synthetic lethal relationship, suggesting that targeting both components could be therapeutically valuable (PMID: 28691904).",

Microduplication of the Xq25 chromosome, containing the locus of STAG2, is seen in some types of cohesinopathies that are characterized by abnormal behavior, intellectual disability, distinctive facial appearance and disorders in speech (PMID: 23637084, 25677961, 25450604, 26443594). Inactivating mutations in STAG2 lead to aneuploidy and chromosomal instability in cancer (PMID: 21852505). Nonsense mutations and deletions of STAG2 are found together in melanoma, Ewing sarcoma, glioblastoma, head and neck carcinoma, bladder carcinoma and myeloid neoplasms, whereas deletions alone are observed in gastric, colorectal and prostate cancers (PMID: 24856830, 21852505, 26122845, 25010205, 24270882, 24121792, 25186949, 22668012, 25223734, 23955599, 25501392, 24121789, 20687102, 24056718, 24335498, 24121791, 25867412). Somatic mutations of STAG2 are observed in myeloid malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, and are associated with worse overall survival and better response to some therapeutic treatments (PMID: 25501392, 25006131, 24335498). STAG2 mutations are prevalent in leukemia patients with IDH2 mutations and are found in more than 95% of patients with secondary leukemia (PMID: 25836588, 25550361). Nonsynonymous mutations are found in glioblastoma, uterine carcinoma and breast carcinoma (PMID: 26352260).

    "STAT1 is a transcription factor that is activated by cytokine and growth factor stimulation of receptor kinases (PMID: 26631912). Activated non-receptor JAK tyrosine kinases phosphorylate STAT1 in response to receptor kinase stimulation, leading to dimerization and nuclear translocation of STAT complexes (PMID: 22520844). STAT1 functions as a homodimer known as the IFN-gamma activator complex, or heterodimerizes with STAT2 molecules (PMID: 28184222). The latter can complex with interferon-regulated genes such as IRF9 to regulate context-specific transcriptional programs known as the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 or ISGF3 (PMID: 28184222). JAK-STAT signaling is initiated by various cytokines, including interleukin and interferon molecules, which stimulate STAT-mediated transcription in the nucleus (PMID: 29921905). STAT1 signaling is critical for regulation of innate and adaptive immunity, including protection from pathogen infections (PMID: 26631912, 29921905). In addition, STAT1 regulates the expression of the immune recognition molecule MHC-I, which promotes clearance of tumor cells by NK and cytotoxic T cells (PMID: 30796216, 19811323). Loss of STAT1 in murine models results in depleted responses to interferon signaling, leading to aberrant T-cell function (PMID: 30796216). STAT1 also regulates various other cellular functions including differentiation, proliferation and cell death (PMID: 26631912). Germline, heterozygous, gain-of-function mutations in STAT1 result in chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, a malignancy that results in persistent infections (PMID: 22651901, 21714643, 21727188). Somatic mutations in STAT1 are not well-studied in human cancers; however, loss of STAT1 in mammary tumor models promotes tumor progression, suggesting STAT1 may function as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 26631912, 21076615, 21311224). Additional studies have indicated that STAT1 may also have context-specific growth promoting roles (PMID: 24726362, 26631912).",

JAK-STAT2 signaling is initiated by various cytokines, including interferon type I (IFN-I) molecules, which stimulate STAT-mediated transcription in the nucleus (PMID: 29921905, 30671054, 28165510). STAT2 signaling is critical for the regulation of anti-viral, immune, apoptotic, and proliferative responses initiated by IFN-I stimulation (PMID: 31605750, 30337919). Loss of STAT2 in murine models leads to deficiencies in various immune cell populations, leading to an ineffective host response to viral infection (PMID: 30134157, 27233962). Germline mutations in STAT2 are found in patients with susceptibility to viral infections due to deficiencies in IFN-I immunity (PMID: 23391734, 28087227, 23391734). STAT2 alterations have also been linked to neurodegeneration following viral infection due to mitochondrial fission defects (PMID: 26122121). Somatic mutations in STAT2 are not well-studied in human cancers; however, STAT2 activity has a critical role in regulating interferon signaling in various contexts in cancer cells (PMID: 30940163, 31605750, 29581268).",

    "STK11 encodes serine/threonine kinase 11, also known as liver kinase B1 (LKB1), that functions as a tumor suppressor. STK11 activates the AMPK (adenine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) pathway via formation of a biologically active heterotrimer with the pseudokinase, STRAD, and the adaptor protein, MO25. Activated AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 and Raptor, which leads mTORC1 hyperactivation (PMID: 14651849, 18439900). STK11-AMPK signaling regulates cell metabolism and energy homeostasis, as well as cellular stress responses to DNA damage and nutrient scarcity (PMID: 21396365). In response to the metabolic stress and hypoxic conditions that often exist within tumors, STK11-AMPK signaling is activated, resulting in inhibition of anabolism, induction of cell cycle arrest and ultimately, suppression of tumor growth (PMID: 25244018). Loss of STK11 has been shown to lead to disorganized cell polarity and tumor growth in nutrient poor conditions. Activation of STK11 by ATM under conditions of DNA damage leads to downstream inhibition of the mTOR pathway (PMID: 20160076). Mutations in STK11 have been found in lung, breast, cervical, testicular, and liver cancers, as well as malignant melanoma, and pancreatic and biliary carcinoma (PMID: 25244018). In addition, the hereditary disease Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, in which STK11 mutations were initially discovered, is characterized by an increased risk of developing both benign and malignant gastrointestinal tumors as well as numerous other cancer types (PMID: 21396365).",
    "STK19 encodes for a nuclear DNA-binding protein that was originally misidentified as a serine/threonine kinase (PMID: 9812991). STK19 is located on chromosome 6, close to the major histocompatibility complex, a region frequently associated with several traits in case-control studies (PMID: 21323541, 23263863, 19851445, 23535732, 19423540). Despite being named as a serine/threonine kinase, STK19 has no intrinsic kinase activity and previous research of STK19’s kinase activity is suggested to be due to an STK19-associated kinase (PMID: 32531245, 32531246). STK19 is tightly chromatin-associated, however its functions as a nuclear protein are currently unknown (PMID: 32531245). STK19 is suggested to bind with an unknown kinase, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of NRAS to drive melanomagenesis, which may be sensitive to STK19 small molecule inhibition (PMID: 30712867, 32531246). STK19 mutations have been identified in a subset of skin cancers (PMID: 22817889, 25600636, 25303977).",
    "STK40 (Serine/Threonine Kinase 40) is a pseudokinase that functions predominantly as an adaptor signaling molecule (PMID: 26663584, 13679039). Structural studies demonstrate that while STK40 has a serine/threonine kinase domain, the protein cannot bind ATP (PMID: 28089446). Overexpression of STK40 inhibits NF-κB activation and p53-mediated transcription, suggesting that STK40 functions as a negative regulator of NF-κB and p53 (PMID: 26663584, 13679039). STK40 also has been shown to bind the E3 ligase COP1, implicating the adaptor in regulation of protein stability (PMID: 28089446). Loss of STK40 expression in several cell line and murine models suggests a role for STK40 in cell differentiation including in hematopoietic cells and skeletal muscle (PMID: 28358362, 27899448). Somatic mutations in STK40 are infrequent in human cancer, however, STK40 expression has been found to be upregulated in several cancer cell line models (PMID: 26286729).",

    "SUFU encodes the protein suppressor of fused which is part of the hedgehog signaling pathway, one of the key regulators of embryonic development (PMID: 23686138). SUFU can sequester GLI transcription factors in the cytoplasm repressing their activity (PMID: 19055941, 10564661, 10559945). SUFU can repress Wnt signaling by exporting beta-catenin from the nucleus (PMID: 11477086) it also can serve as a point of interaction between the hedgehog and p63 pathways which may be an important part of the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation (PMID: 23686138). SUFU is a tumor-suppressor in which truncating germline or somatic mutations, often accompanied by loss of the wildtype allele, are strongly associated with pediatric medulloblastoma (PMID: 12068298, 24651015). Germline mutations in SUFU can cause Gorlin syndrome (PMID: 25403219). No drugs specifically target SUFU although there are drugs that target the hedgehog signaling pathway (PMID: 23291299).",

    "The SUZ12 (Suppressor of Zeste 12) is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for transcriptional repression by catalyzing di- and tri-methylation of Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) (PMID: 16630818). SUZ12 is necessary for both the histone methyltransferase activity and silencing function of PRC2 (PMID: 15225548), which are important in regulating development and expression of cell identity genes, including the HOX cluster of genes (PMID: 16625203). SUZ12 is commonly mutated in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and myeloid neoplasms (PMID: 25240281, 22237151, 22237106, 23486531). Translocations involving SUZ12 have been identified in endometrial stromal tumors (PMID: 11371647). Mutations in SUZ12 can cooperate with Ras pathway signaling in cellular transformation and may sensitize tumor cells to bromodomain inhibitors (PMID: 25119042).",
    "SYK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is recruited to the cell membrane through binding of its SH2 domain to membrane receptors and is subsequently activated via phosphorylation (PMID: 7538118). SYK is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and activation of SYK-mediated signaling pathways is necessary for B-cell and lymphatic system development (PMID: 10963601, 17699797, 23609194). In B- and T-cell signal transduction, SYK binds ITAM adaptor molecules that complex with the B-cell receptor (BCR) and T-cell receptor (TCR) mediating critical immune regulatory pathways (PMID: 7477353, 12522250). SYK activity is required to activate various other signaling pathways that mediate cellular adhesion, osteoclast maturation, platelet activation and vascular development (PMID: 20467426). Somatic mutations in SYK are rare in human cancers; however, activated SYK signaling has been identified in leukemias and lymphomas (PMID: 24525236, 19800574, 26575169, 23764004). In addition, activation of SYK signaling has been described as a mechanism of ovarian cancer chemoresistance (PMID: 26096845). Case reports have reported translocations in SYK in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and lymphomas (PMID: 11159536, 16341044). The SYK tyrosine kinase inhibitor fostamatinib is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for efficacy in hematopoietic malignancies (PMID: 26575169, 23764004).",
    "SZT2 encodes the seizure threshold 2 homolog protein, which is expressed in the brain, predominantly in the parietal frontal cortex and dorsal root ganglia, and in other tissues at lower levels (PMID: 34685691). Expression of SZT2 in the brain suggests that it may play a role during early brain development through neuronal migration, axon guidance, and synapse formation (PMID: 30970654, 19624305). While its biological function is not fully understood, the SZT2 protein is highly conserved and has been implicated in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and protein quality control. Other potential functions of SZT2 include involvement in calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial function and the cellular stress response pathway (PMID: 30970654). Mutations in the SZT2 gene cause severe epileptic and neurological encephalopathy (PMID: 34685691, 36250465, 28199315, 30970654). SZT2 is a component of the KICSTOR complex which is required for the localization of the GATOR1 complex on the lysosome surface. Both the KICSTOR and GATOR1 complexes act as negative regulators of mTORC1 activity (PMID: 33685991, 30970654). In hematopoietic stem cells, loss of SZT2 causes an elevation of mTORC1 activity and reactive oxygen species production and impairs the repopulating capacity of the cells (PMID: 36250465). Mutations in the SZT2 gene have been identified in patients with PIK3CA-mutated ER+ breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 33685991, 30970654).",

    "TAL1 (also SCL) is a transcription factor that is a member of the class II basic helix-loop-helix family (bLHL) (PMID: 28179281). TAL1 is expressed in many hematopoietic cell types including hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent progenitors, megakaryocytes, and erythroid cells; however, TAL1 is silenced in lymphoid lineages (PMID: 7678994, 28179281). Like other bLHL transcription factors, TAL1 functions as a heterodimer with class I bHLH transcription factors and binds E-box motifs to regulate gene expression (PMID: 9214632). TAL1 regulates the activity of numerous genes via interaction with other hematopoietic transcription factors including LMO2, GATA1, LDB1, RUNX1, ETS family proteins, among others (PMID: 20887958). Binding of TAL1 across the genome is distinct depending on hematopoietic cell type, suggesting that TAL1 transcriptional regulation is context dependent (PMID: 21179004). In addition, TAL1 likely has additional roles in the activation of transcription factor partners beyond the role in DNA binding (PMID: 10498694). Loss of TAL1 in mice results in the absence of blood formation during early hematopoietic development and the depletion of differentiated hematopoietic cells in adults, demonstrating that TAL1 is critical in early hematopoietic lineage specification (PMID: 7830794, 8689686). TAL1 overexpression is common in patients in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and recurrent translocations that result in TAL1 activation are also found in T-ALL, suggesting that TAL1 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 19562638, 21057528).",

    "TBL1XR1 (also TBLR1) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that is a member of the WD40 repeat-containing protein family (PMID: 26069883). TBL1XR1 functions as a transcriptional co-repressor by binding the NCoR (nuclear receptor corepressor)/SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors) complex and mediates histone deacetylation at target genes (PMID: PMID: 26069883). TBL1XR1, in collaboration with TBL1X, stabilizes the NCoR/SMRT complex on chromatin via interactions with histone H2B and H4 (PMID: 28687524, 18202150). In addition, TBL1XR1 mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the NCoR/SMRT complexes after ligand binding to nuclear receptors (PMID: 26069883, 14980219). Ligand binding initiates activation of several hormone receptors, including the androgen receptor and retinoic acid receptor (PMID: 26069883, 16893456). TBL1XR1 also functions as a transcriptional regulator of NF-κB and WNT signaling genes (PMID: 26069883).

    "TCF7L2 (also known as TCF4) is a transcription factor that positively regulates the WNT/beta-catenin pathway (PMID: 22934027, 23260145). WNT-ligand induced pathway activation results in destabilization of the beta-catenin destruction complex, leading to stabilization of beta-catenin. TCF7L2 forms a bipartite transcription factor complex in the nucleus with beta-catenin to activate WNT-dependent target genes (PMID: 22934027). Loss of TCF7L2 activity in murine models results in reduced hepatic glucose production and dysregulation of metabolic gene expression programs (PMID: 23260145). TCF7L2 has also been found to regulate gene expression programs in a variety of cell types that impact cellular proliferation and metabolism (PMID: 26955760, 29301589, 29190896, 18289012).

TCL1B is predominantly expressed during development and immature lymphocytes (PMID: 10077617, 10588720). Like the more well-studied family member TCL1A, TCL1B functions as an intracellular protein that stabilizes AKT heterodimers at the cytoplasmic membrane, augments effector signaling and mediates AKT nuclear localization (PMID: 10716693, 10983986). The concentration of TCL1B proteins is important to regulate signaling pathways that control proliferation, survival, and immune regulation (PMID: 10716693, 10983986, 9285687, 11839817). Further biochemical experiments are required to more clearly delineate the function of TCL1B. Over-expression of TCL1A in T- and B-cell malignancies is common, suggesting that TCL1A predominantly functions as an oncogene (PMID: 11839817). Rearrangements involving TCL1B are recurrent in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), typically due to aberrant VDJ recombination of T-cell receptor genes and leading to TCL1A activation (PMID: 24042734, 3258192).",
    "The TEK gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) protein also known as angiopoietin-1 receptor.

The role of TEK in cancer depends on the predominant ligand binding the receptor, with angiopoietin-1 having an agonist effect and promoting angiogenesis and angiopoietin-2 having an antagonistic role (PMID: 20651738). TEK mutations are rare events in human cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).",
    "TENT5C is a protein that belongs to the group XXV nucleotidyltransferase superfamily and functions as a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase (PMID: 27060136). TENT5C expression has been shown to regulate cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, and regulation of RAS/MAPK signaling (PMID: 28341836). Loss-of-function TENT5C mutations and deletions have been identified in multiple myeloma, suggesting that TENT5C is a tumor suppressor (PMID: 21430775, 26282654, 20616218, 24434212). Mutations or deletions in TENT5C are associated with reduced overall survival in patients with multiple myleoma (PMID: 21994415). Rearrangements between MYC and TENT5C have also been found in patients with multiple myeloma (PMID: 24632883).",
    "Amplification of TERT is found in multiple cancer types. In vitro studies suggest that TERT amplification confers a growth advantage to cells, as cells transformed with multiple copies of TERT clonally outgrow cells with fewer copies of TERT (PMID: 18482052)",

    "The TERT gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains telomere length and genomic integrity. TERT expression is low or absent in somatic cells; however, telomerase activity is upregulated in a vast majority of tumors and likely contributes to cancer cell immortality (PMID: 24657534, 9282118). Sequencing of the TERT promoter identified activating mutations in a number of cancer types including melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, medulloblastoma and glioma (PMID: 23348506, 23530248). Tumors with highly recurrent TERT promoter mutations tend to originate from tissues with lower rates of self-renewal (PMID: 23530248). TERT promoter mutations, C228T and C250T, account for the majority of the somatic TERT promoter alterations and occur 124 and 146 base pairs upstream of the ATG start codon of TERT, respectively. Both promoter mutations create binding motifs for erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS)/ T-cell factor (TCF) transcription factors and enhance telomerase activity (PMID: 23348503, 23348506, 26194807). In addition to promoter mutations, TERT, located on chromosome 5p, is amplified across many cancer types (PMID: 20164920).",

    ". In colorectal cancer cells, loss of TET1 led to activation of the WNT pathway and cell proliferation (PMID: 25362856)",
    "TET1 is an iron- and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme that is involved in converting 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (PMID: 19372391). This conversion of the DNA base to 5hmC is the initial step in active DNA methylation, which is important in gene regulation, cellular reprogramming, and mammalian development (PMID: 20639862). TET enzyme activity is inhibited by 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an inhibitory metabolite produced by specific mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 whose production results in a highly specific DNA methylation profile and is often found in certain glioblastomas and leukemias (PMID: 21383741). TET1 was first identified as a translocation partner of the MLL gene and a key oncogenic driver in acute myeloid leukemias (PMID: 23818607). Reduced TET1 expression has also been observed in various human cancers. In breast cancer, reduced TET1 levels were shown to associate with increased tumor growth and metastasis (PMID: 23716660), and in colon cancer cell lines, reduced TET1 expression was associated with an aberrant CpG methylation profile and WNT pathway activation (PMID: 27977763, 25362856).

    "TET2 belongs to a family of alpha-ketoglutarate and iron-dependent enzymes involved in converting 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (PMID: 19372391). This modification is implicated in active DNA demethylation, a process that is important for cellular reprogramming and gene regulation (PMID: 20639862). TET2 has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor with mutations leading to loss-of-function, particularly those affecting the C-terminal catalytic domain (PMID: 21057493). In animal models, TET2 loss cooperates with other mutations such as JAK2 and FLT3-ITD mutations to promote cancer progression and can induce genomic hypermethylation and increase stem cell self-renewal (PMID: 21723200, 25281607, 25873173, 25886910). TET2 mutations are most often found in hematologic malignancies (PMID: 24220273). Isolated mutations in TET2 have also been found in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis but with no apparent hematologic disease (PMID: 23001125). However, these patients are at a higher risk of developing hematologic cancer with aging (PMID: 25426837, 25426838). TET family enzyme activity is also inhibited by specific mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 that produce an inhibitory co-factor, 2-hydroxyglutarate (PMID: 21130701). Mutations in WT1 may also affect TET2 function as an associated co-factor (PMID: 25482556, 25601757).",

The 5-hmc modification is implicated in active DNA demethylation, a process that is important for cellular reprogramming and gene regulation (PMID: 20639862). The TET enzymes, including TET1 and TET2, are also involved in the oxidation of 5-mc to other cytosine derivatives (PMID: 21778364). TET3 also bind O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and REST to promote the binding of methyltransferases to chromatin (PMID: 23353889, 24304661, 25843715). In addition, TET3 physically associates with WT1 to mediate DNA methylation in leukemic cells (PMID: 25482556). TET-mediated hydroxymethylation has been implicated in a variety of cellular process including the regulation of somatic cell reprogramming (PMID: 24529596), hematopoietic differentiation (PMID: 24619230, 26257178), DNA damage response (PMID: 28325772), and telomere elongation (PMID: 25223896). Altered TET family member expression and 5-hmc levels have been correlated with tumor progression and prognosis in a variety of cancer types (PMID: 23671639, 26207381, 27848178). Somatic loss-of-function mutations in TET3 have been found in myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia and colon cancer, among others (PMID: 19388938, 19420352, 22895193, 28452984, 29531217).

When nutrients are abundant, TFE3 is retained in the cytoplasm by mTORC1 phosphorylation and binding to the scaffolding protein 14-3-3 (PMID: 24448649). Activity and localization of TFE3 are also mediated by Rag GTPases, under control of the amino acid sensor Ragulator (PMID: 24448649, 22980980). In response to nutrient deprivation, TFE3 regulates the number of lysosomes in the cell (PMID: 24448649). TFE3 translocates to the nucleus upon starvation and upregulates a variety of genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis (PMID: 24448649, 22576015). In addition, TFE3 mediates a variety of immune-related activities including autophagy, proinflammatory cytokine expression and antibody production, among others (PMID: 26813791, 26813791, 30917316). Expression of TFE3 is implicated in hematopoietic and osteoclast differentiation (PMID: 17046750, 23599343).

    "TLX1 (also HOX11) is a transcription factor that is a member of the NK-like subfamily of homeobox genes (PMID: 19835636). TLX1 functions predominantly as a transcriptional repressor at T-cell lineage-specific enhancers and antagonizes NOTCH1 (PMID: 26108691). In collaboration with the transcription factor STAT5, TLX1 binds enhancer regions of genes that drive leukemic gene expression programs including BCL2 and MYC (PMID: 19835636). TLX1 is not expressed in the hematopoietic system; however, TLX1 activation is observed in several hematopoietic malignancies (PMID: 21326611). Transcriptional activity of TLX1 has been associated with several cellular functions including transformation, mitotic checkpoint control, and genome stability (PMID: 20972433, 9009195, 7905617). TLX1 downregulates the mitotic checkpoint gene CHEK2, leading to aneuploidy in TLX1-positive human and murine leukemic tumors (PMID: 20972433).

    "TONSL encodes the Tonsoku-like DNA repair protein, which is a multi-domain scaffold protein that plays a critical role in resistance to replication stress and maintaining genome integrity. TONSL interacts with various DNA replication and repair factors including anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1), minichromosome maintenance complex component helicases (MCM helicases), H3 and H4 histones and methanesulfonate sensitivity protein 22-like protein (MMS22L) (PMID: 32959051, 30773278). TONSL, in a heterodimer complex with MMS22L, is involved in repairing spontaneous DNA lesions through homologous recombination (PMID: 30773278). The MMS22L-TONSL complex functions in the DNA damage response upon replication fork collapse and to mediate recovery from replicative stress (PMID: 36622344, 37057595). The MMS22L-TONSL complex is recruited by replication protein A (RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3) to sites of stalled replication forks during normal S-phase replication and promotes homologous recombination by facilitating the assembly of RAD51 (PMID: 30773278, 30773277, 32959051). TONSL is thought to negatively regulate NF-kappa-B by binding to NF-kappa-B complexes and trapping them in the cytoplasm, preventing them from interacting with DNA ((PMID: 30723051, 31158361). NF-kappa-B complexes can then enter the nucleus upon phosphorylation and ubiquitination of TONSL (PMID: 30723051).

Engagement of antigen-presenting MHC class proteins with TRA/TRB heterodimers results in conformational changes and activation of downstream pathways leading to activation of TCR-mediated signaling (PMID: 29261409). TRA rearrangements are recurrently found in patients with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemias, typically leading to activation of the fusion partner (PMID: 29279377, 28671688). Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy is FDA-approved for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in which cancer cells from patients are engineered to express TCRs that are recognized by the immune system (PMID: 29914976, 29539277, 29113977).",
    "TRAF2 is an adaptor molecule that interacts with and transduces signals from the Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (PMID: 8565075, 8985011, 8898208). Following TNF engagement, TRAF2 mediates the assembly of signaling scaffolds to activate the NF-κB pathway, JNK (Jun amino-terminal kinases), and anti-apoptotic pathways (PMID: 8565075, 8985011, 8898208). TRAF2 also has ubiquitin ligase activity that can regulate protein stability (PMID: 23142077, 20577214). Signaling cascades mediated by TRAF2 have been implicated in lymphocyte proliferation and survival, immune response, and hematopoietic stem cell activation (PMID: 9390693, 9390694, 11435475). In cell line and murine cancer models, TRAF2 expression is involved in NF-κB activation leading to tumor cell survival and resistance to targeted therapy (PMID: 25843712, 19336568, 22589389). Somatic mutations in TRAF2 have been identified multiple myeloma, lymphomas, and nasopharyngeal carcinomas (PMID: 17692805, 24362935, 19412164, 23868181). TRAF2 mutations are predicted to be loss-of-function and dysregulate NF-κB signaling (PMID: 24362935, 19412164, 23868181). Amplification of TRAF2 has also been identified in epithelial cancers (PMID: 24362534).",
    "TRAF3 is an E3 ligase and signaling molecule that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNFR)-associated factor (TRAF) family (PMID: 21660053). TRAF3 functions downstream of Interleukin-1 (IL-1) or Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, which are important in the regulation of innate immunity and inflammation (PMID: 21660053). TRAF3 can function as an E3 ligase in TLR pathways, promoting K63-linked polyubiquitination in order to maintain protein-protein interactions (PMID: 21660053, 25847972). Alternatively, TRAF3 can function as a negative regulator of cytokine activity by binding MAPK effectors; degradation of TRAF3 releases MAPK-regulatory proteins, such as MAP3K1, leading to MAPK pathway activation (PMID: 30140268). In addition, TRAF3 can bind TRAF2 and cIAPs to negatively regulate the NF-κB pathway, and TRAF3 degradation results in the release of NF-κB effector molecules, such as NIK (PMID: 21660053, 15383523). TRAF3 also positively regulates the expression of IRF3 and IRF7, proteins that activate the transcription of type I interferon cytokines (PMID: 16306937). Loss of TRAF3 results in the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (PMID: 16306937) and reduced B cell homeostasis (PMID: 17723217). TRAF3 can also bind CD40, a costimulatory protein on T cells that is required for T cell activation, and the TRAF3/CD40 interaction mediates class switching (PMID: 8934568, 12354380). Alterations of TRAF3 have been associated with immune deficiencies in response to primary infection (PMID: 20832341). Loss-of-function mutations in TRAF3 are found in multiple myeloma (PMID: 17692804, 17692805), resulting in activation of NF-κB signaling. Deletions of TRAF3 have also been identified in B cell lymphomas (PMID: 19693093, 22033491, 22469134, 25468570).",
    "TRAF5 is a signaling molecule that is a member of tumor necrosis factor (TNFR)-associated factor (TRAF) family (PMID: 8663299). TRAF5 functions downstream of TNFR and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, which are important in the regulation of innate immunity and inflammation (PMID: 12842894). TRAF5 functions as an adaptor molecule in signaling complexes that negatively regulate TLR signaling, in part by activating downstream signaling cascades and mediating cytokine signaling (PMID: 10623461). TRAF5 predominantly acts as an adaptor molecule that binds a complex including TRAF2, leading to activation of downstream NF-κB, JNK and MAPK signaling pathways (PMID: 8790348, 8999898). In addition, TRAF5 can also bind CD40, a costimulatory protein on T cells that is required for T cell activation (PMID: 8790348). An interaction between TRAF2 and TRAF5 is also associated with inhibition of JAK kinase dimerization, leading to inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling (PMID: 29668931). TRAF5 has also been implicated in the regulation of inflammation, as loss of TRAF5 leads to a marked reduction in immune cell infiltration in several tissue types (PMID: 29596835). Mutations in TRAF5 are relatively rare in human cancers; however, loss-of-function alterations have been identified in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PMID: 19412164).",
    "TRAF7 is an E3 ligase and signaling molecule that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family (PMID: 27808423). TRAF7 activity is important for the regulation of the MAPK and NF-kB signal transduction pathways (PMID: 27808423). TRAF7 binds and potentiates the activity of MEKK3, a protein implicated in the activation of downstream MAPK and NF-kB signaling (PMID: 15001576). Additional functional studies have demonstrated that TRAF7 can mediate the stability of several NF-kB pathway members including NEMO and p65 (PMID: 21518757). TRAF7 has also been identified as an agonist for the JNK-AP1 pathway (PMID: 14743216). In addition, TRAF7 targets ubiquitination of c-FLIP, an antiapoptotic molecule, as well as p53, implicating TRAF7 in apoptosis and cellular proliferation (PMID: 14743216, 23128672). Recurrent somatic mutations in TRAF7 have been identified meningiomas, including in 93% of secretory meningiomas (PMID: 23348505, 23404370), and predominantly occur as loss-of-function mutations. TRAF7 mutations commonly co-occur with KLF4 and AKT1 mutations and are mutually exclusive with NF2 alterations (PMID: 23404370). TRAF7 is also mutated in Merkel cell carcinomas and mesotheliomas (PMID: 27808423, 26655088).",

The mTOR signaling pathway has a central role in promoting cellular growth and regulating protein synthesis. TSC1 acts as a scaffold to form a heteromeric complex with TBC1D7 and TSC2; the resulting TSC complex functions as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) and inhibits RHEB (PMID: 22795129, 24529379, 24714658), which is a GTPase that functions as a small molecular switch, activating mTORC1 when bound to GTP (PMID: 24863881). Both TSC1 and TSC2 are also phosphorylated by several kinases (e.g., AKT, RSK1, ERK, AMPK, and GSK3) thus providing regulatory inhibition of the mTOR pathway via several different signaling pathways (PMID: 16959574).

    "TSC2 (also tumerin) is a key negative regulator of the pro-oncogenic mTOR signaling pathway (PMID: 23485365, 20301399, 10205261). The mTOR signaling pathway has a central role in promoting cellular growth and regulating protein synthesis. TSC2 acts as a scaffold to form a heteromeric complex with TBC1D7 and TSC1; the resulting TSC complex functions as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) and inhibits RHEB (PMID: 22795129, 24529379, 24714658), which is a GTPase that functions as a small molecular switch, activating mTORC1 when bound to GTP (PMID: 24863881). Both TSC1 and TSC2 are also phosphorylated by several kinases (e.g., AKT, RSK1, ERK, AMPK, and GSK3) thus providing regulatory inhibition of the mTOR pathway via several different signaling pathways (PMID: 16959574). Both TSC1 and TSC2 are also phosphorylated by several kinases (e.g., AKT, RSK1, ERK, AMPK, and GSK3) thus providing regulatory inhibition of the mTOR pathway via several different signaling pathways (PMID: 16959574). Germline mutations in TSC2 are associated with tuberous sclerosis, a disorder that results in benign and occasionally malignant tumor growths (PMID: 23485365, 9242607). Somatic TSC2 mutations have been identified in several cancers, including liver and endometrial cancers, and predominantly present as truncating loss-of-function mutations (cBioPortal, MSKCC, February 2018). TSC2 loss-of-function mutations result in constitutive activation of the mTORC1 complex resulting in sensitivity to mTOR-inhibiting agents (i.e., rapamycin analogs) (PMID: 22923433).",
    "TSHR (thyroid stimulating hormone receptor) is a transmembrane protein that binds thyrotropin and thyrostimulin (PMID: 2556796). TSHR is expressed in the thyroid gland and regulates the growth of thyroid cells and the release of thyroid hormone (PMID: 24931193). It belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors (PMID: 18719020). Activation of the receptor results higher cAMP levels, increased Protein Kinase A activity and phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factors such as cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (CREB) (PMID: 11158328). TSHR may also activate other pathways including the RAS-MAPK, Protein Kinase C, and NFkB pathways (PMID: 11039907, 15062572, 18719020). Germline activating mutations result in hyperthyroidism while loss-of-function mutations lead to hypothyroidism (PMID: 7920658, 23154162, 20926595). Activating mutations are found in thyroid carcinomas (PMID: 7478621, 26260781). TSHR pathway activation has been found to cooperate with BRAF mutations in thyroid tumor initiation (PMID: 21220306).",
    "TYK2 fusion proteins generally involve the fusion of the C-terminal end of TYK2 with the N-terminal of the fusion partner. These fusion proteins generally retain the TYK2 kinase domain while losing activity of the pseudokinase domain that functions to negatively regulate kinase activity, ultimately resulting in increased TYK2 kinase activity. These fusion protein are typically found in patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. In vitro, cell-based studies expressing various TYK2 fusion proteins demonstrate that they are activating as shown by increased downstream pathway activation and cell proliferation (PMID: 25349176)",

    "TYK2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is a member of the JAK kinase family (PMID: 17721432, 18682296). TYK2 requires a cognate cytokine receptor to initiate extracellular cytokine signaling cascades, including interferon signaling (PMID: 24654603). Activation of TYK2 leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of downstream effectors, such as STAT3/5 and MAPK, enabling the translocation of these signaling molecules to the nucleus to activate transcription (PMID: 29162862, 28295194). TYK2 is an important mediator of inflammation and loss of TYK2 in murine models results in reduced cytokine responses (PMID: 11070173). Mutations in TYK2 have been identified in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), a malignancy in which patients have increased mycobacterial and viral infections due to impaired cytokine signaling (PMID: 26304966). Fusion proteins containing TYK2 have been identified in patients with hematopoietic malignancies (PMID: 25207766). Germline mutations in TYK2 have been found in acute myeloid leukemia patients; however, somatic TYK2 mutations are relatively rare (PMID: 18270328). While somatic mutations in TYK2 are uncommon, activation of the TYK2/STAT pathway has been found to be oncogenic in many tumor types, including in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and breast cancer (PMID: 23471820, 21864028). TYK2 can also mediate drug resistance to the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib via the formation of drug-resistant TYK2/JAK2 heterodimers (PMID: 22820254).",

    "U2AF1 (U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1) is the splicing factor subunit protein, U2AF35, which together with its binding partner, U2AF65, regulates the removal of introns from pre-mRNAs to produce mature mRNAs that will be translated during protein synthesis (PMID: 1388271). The U2AF1 protein is essential for constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing since it recruits the whole U2AF complex to the 3' end of the pre-mRNA intron that will be spliced (PMID: 8647433, 10617206, 10617208). Mutations in the U2AF1 gene have been found recurrently similarly in hematological malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (PMID: 22389253) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) (PMID: 22158538) or Chronic Myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (PMID: 22323480). Interestingly it has been proposed that mutations in RNA splicing genes are drivers of the transition from MDS to different sort of myeloid leukemias (PMID: 24030381). Therefore, the U2AF1 protein has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target (PMID: 21909114, 22158538, 22323480, 25965570, 25326705). Importantly, it has been shown that mutations in the U2AF1 gene happen early in leukemia development as it has been shown in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s-AML) and can persist during disease progression (PMID: 25550361).",
    "U2AF2 (also U2AF65) is an RNA binding protein that functions as the large component of the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) protein complex (PMID: 1285125, 21753750, 25901584). The U2AF complex is necessary for the binding of U2 small nuclear RNA molecules to the pre-mRNA branch site, which is required for formation of the pre-spliceosome complex and 3’ splice site selection (PMID: 7685763, 9528748). U2AF2 specifically coordinates the annealing of complementary sequences, RNA binding and regulation of RNA helicases to mediate the formation of duplex RNA (PMID: 7685763). U2AF regulates the splicing of many genes at enhancer-dependent introns including WT1 (PMID: 9784496) and FAS (PMID: 16109372), among others (PMID: 11421359). In addition, U2AF2 has a role in the nuclear export of mRNA (PMID: 11724776) and immune regulation (PMID: 29275860). Altered U2AF2 function has been linked to diseases associated with neurodegeneration due to the presence of CAG repeats in mRNA (PMID: 21725067). U2AF2 mediates alternative splicing of CD44 in melanoma, resulting in CD44 alternative isoforms that mediate tumor progression and metastasis (PMID: 27041584). Somatic U2AF2 mutations are found in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID: 22389253). U2AF2 alterations reduce the affinity of U2AF2 for the splice acceptor site resulting in mis-spliced mRNA transcripts (PMID: 25311244, 28850223).",

In vitro studies with MCF10A cells overexpressing UBE2A demonstrate that amplification is activating as measured by promotion of multinucleated cells, centrosome amplification, multipolar mitotic spindles, aneuploidy and anchorage-independent growth compared to normal expression (PMID: 11929833)",
    "UBE2A, a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family, functions in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of protein degradation (PMID: 26476408). UBE2A accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex UBE1 via a trans-thioesterification reaction to catalyze association with E3 ligases and ubiquitination of target proteins (PMID: 20061386, 19325620). DNA polymerase cofactor PCNA is a target for UBE2A ubiquitination, activating the protein’s translesion DNA repair following DNA damage (PMID: 36162503, 30531907). UBE2A amplification in cancer cell lines induces chromosomal instability and transformation, suggesting that UBE2A functions primarily as an oncogene (PMID: 11929833). UBE2A overexpression and point mutations have been identified in various cancer types, including ovarian cancer, breast cancer and melanoma (PMID: 26679603, 12640129, 24891954).",
    "UB5R amplification results in overexpression of the protein. This mutation has been found in breast cancer and is co-amplified with MYC. Expression of UBR5 is activating as measured by reduced cell proliferation upon UBR5 knockdown in cervical cancer and breast cancer cell lines (PMID: 32029551)",
    "UBR5 (also EDD, HYD) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is a member of the HECT ligase family (PMID: 10030672). E3 ligase proteins define substrate specificity for proteins targeted to the proteasome for degradation. UBR5 appears to target proteins for degradation via the N-end rule for substrates, identifying proteins for degradation based on N-terminal amino acids (PMID: 16055722, 17462990). UBR5 is responsible for the degradation of a variety of substrates including PAIP2, a poly-A tail regulatory binding protein, and TOPBP1, a DNA damage protein (PMID: 16601676, 11714696). UBR5 has also been implicated in the regulation of WNT activity by directly ubiquitinating β-catenin (PMID: 28689657). UBR5 has a number of additional substrates that are involved in translational elongation, telomerase activity, gluconeogenesis, epigenetic regulation and histone degradation after DNA damage (PMID: 21127351, 21726808, 23362280, 27647897, 27647897). In addition, UBR5 is an important regulator of the cell cycle DNA damage checkpoint and loss of UBR5 results in the accumulation of polyploid cells, suggesting a role in genome stability (PMID: 17074762, 18073532, 21383020, 25833949). Overexpression of UBR5 has been identified in patients with breast and ovarian cancer and is associated with poorer patient outcome (PMID: 28330927, 12902990, 18349819). Increased UBR5 expression is linked to metastasis and cisplatin resistance in ovarian and breast cancer cells (PMID: 28330927, 24379240). However, somatic mutations in UBR5 are found in patients with mantle cell lymphomas and are predicted to be loss-of-function (PMID: 23407552).",
    "UPF1 is an RNA helicase involved in mRNA surveillance. UPF1 is essential for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which is a pathway that degrades aberrant mRNA transcripts (PMID: 11163187, 16086026, 21145460, 21419344). Following recruitment of UPF1 to target mRNA substrates, UPF1 scans the mRNA transcript, remodels the messenger ribonucleoprotein complex, and regulates the degradation of target transcripts (PMID: 21145460). Disruption of UPF1 function results in decreased nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (PMID: 28663146). Somatic mutations in the UPF1 gene have been identified in pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PMID: 24859531) and decreased levels of UPF1 in lung adenocarcinoma has been associated with tumor progression (PMID: 28663146).

    "USP8 (also UBPY) is a ubiquitin isopeptidase that is a member of the UBP hydrolase family (PMID: 9628861). Ubiquitin hydrolases deubiquitinate target proteins, protecting them from degradation via the proteasome or lysosome (PMID: 16120644). USP8 mediates the stabilization of numerous proteins, including growth factor receptors such as EGFR (PMID: 16120644, 25675982, 30221684, 29933386, 29626091). Because USP8 is important in the regulation of a variety of proteins, USP8 activity mediates various cellular processes including cellular proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and ciliogenesis, among others (PMID: 29472535, 27321185, 26683461). USP8 phosphorylation recruits the adaptor molecule 14-3-3, leading to inactivation of USP8 catalytic activity (PMID: 17720156, 20736164, 29473952). Stabilization of USP8 results in the inability of target substrates to be appropriately targeted for degradation (PMID: 25675982). Recurrent gain-of-function mutations in USP8 are found in patients with Cushing's disease, a disorder that results in the overproduction of cortisol and development of associated tumors that localize to the pituitary gland (PMID: 25675982, 28505279, 28982703, 30315484). USP8 mutations that are associated with Cushing's disease commonly occur in the 14-3-3 binding region, resulting in uncontrolled activation of USP8 (PMID: 25675982). Altered USP8 expression results in the increased expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the precursor of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is overproduced in Cushing’s disease (PMID: 25675982). Overexpression of USP8 has been identified in several cancer types (PMID: 29880877, 23748694).",

    "VAV1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is a member of the VAV family of proteins (PMID: 26353933). GEFs are proteins that regulate the activity of monomeric GTPases by coordinating the binding of GTP and the release of GDP (PMID: 26353933). VAV1 is expressed predominantly in the hematopoietic system and has selective substrate specificity for the GTPase Rac (PMID: 11781818). The activity of VAV1 is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (PMID: 11781818) via several tyrosine kinases dependent on cellular context including TCR (T cell receptor), BCR (B cell receptor), and chemokine receptors (PMID: 1531699, 1375396, 10092764, 15872091). VAV1 signaling is required for appropriate lineage commitment and differentiation in a variety of hematopoietic cell types (PMID: 26353933). VAV1 has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions including T cell function, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, MAPK signaling and transcriptional regulation (PMID: 15886116, 10669724). In a hematopoietic screen, VAV1 was determined to have activity as a proto-oncogene (PMID: 2477241), but can also have tumor suppressive activity in functional studies (PMID: 23342133, 30297765, 26353933). Somatic mutations in VAV1 are found in T-cell leukemias/lymphomas and lung adenocarcinomas, among others (PMID: 26437031, 27369867, 28062691, 27158780, 25426554) and are predicted to be gain-of-function. Fusion proteins containing VAV1 have also been identified in peripheral T-cell lymphomas and other hematopoietic malignancies (PMID: 28062691, 28832024). Overexpression of VAV1 is found across a range of solid tumors, suggesting VAV1 predominantly functions as an oncogene in this context (PMID: 19533802, 23342133, 15652748).",
    "VAV2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is a member of the VAV family of proteins (PMID: 26353933).

VAV2 is ubiquitously expressed across many cell types and has selective substrate specificity for the GTPase RAC (PMID: 17996485). The activity of VAV2 is regulated by phosphorylation (PMID: 11781818) via several tyrosine kinases dependent on cellular context including BCR (B cell receptor) and chemokine receptors (PMID: 11376343, 14623913). VAV2 signaling is required for appropriate lineage commitment and differentiation in a variety of hematopoietic cell types, with some redundant and non-redundant roles with family members VAV1 and VAV3 (PMID: 14623913, 15941910). In transformation assays, VAV2 was implicated as an oncogene and mediates cell proliferation and foci formation (PMID: 8710375). Overexpression of VAV2 is implicated in a variety of cancer types including breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) (PMID: 26910843, 17234718, 23033540). Somatic mutations in VAV2 are rare; however, VAV2 coordinates cellular proliferation and invasion in various cancer models via an EGFR/RAC1 signaling pathway (PMID: 20940296).",

    "VEGFA (also VEGF) is a growth factor that is a member of the family of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs). VEGFA binds the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 to mediate downstream signaling, with almost all of the known cellular responses mediated by VEGFR2 (PMID: 16951216). Other types of receptors contribute to VEGFA signaling, including platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PMID: 17470632) and neuropilins (PMID: 22948112, 23116416). Expression of VEGFA is critical for mediating angiogenesis and vascular permeability, stimulating the migration and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (PMID: 24263190). Autocrine VEGF signaling contributes to angiogenesis and cell proliferation (PMID: 22693250) and has been shown to promote the function of cancer stem cells (PMID: 22012397, 20141840). Paracrine VEGFA signaling also impacts the function of nearby immune cells (PMID: 23045606) and fibroblasts (PMID: 22738912, 21057529). Overexpression of VEGFA has been associated with the familial disorder Crow-Fulcase syndrome that is characterized by reduced vasopermeability (PMID: 9771661). VEGFA predominantly functions as an oncogene in human cancers and is commonly overexpressed in many solid tumor types, likely mediating enhanced tumor angiogenesis (PMID: 24263190). The VEGFA inhibitors bevacizumab (PMID: 17212999) and aflibercept (PMID: 22446028) are FDA-approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and glioblastoma.",

    ". Large-scale deletions of VHL affecting adjacent genes likely correlate with specific disease phenotypes (PMID: 19764026)",
    ". Loss of VHL leads to inappropriate activation of HIF downstream target genes, thus promoting tumorigenesis in normoxic conditions (PMID: 21386872)",
    "VHL is an E3 ligase that functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 10102622, 9671762). The VHL protein forms a ternary complex with transcription elongation factors B and C, which is critical for the stabilization and activity of VHL (PMID: 25533676). VHL mutations that disrupt this complex lead to an unstable VHL protein that is aberrantly degraded (PMID: 7660130, 7660122). Under normal oxygen conditions, VHL plays a crucial role in the regulation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs); VHL binds HIF proteins and targets them for ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome (PMID: 10878807). HIFs are responsible for transcription of numerous genes in response to hypoxic conditions, including pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (PMID: 25533676). Loss of VHL leads to activation of HIF downstream target genes and can promote tumorigenesis in normoxic conditions (PMID: 21386872). VHL loss can cause hereditary and sporadic forms of von Hippel-Lindau disease, which is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, retinal hemangioblastomas, phaeochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PMID: 18676741, 25533676). Somatic functional inactivation of VHL has been reported through bi-allelic loss of the VHL gene in cases of 3p deletion (PMID: 2885753), heterozygous VHL mutations (PMID: 7915601, 21715564) or promoter methylation (PMID: 7937876) in human cancers. Inhibitors that target VEGF receptors and HIF proteins may have therapeutic efficacy in tumors with VHL loss (PMID: 25533676).",
    "VTCN1 encodes the V-set domain containing T cell activation inhibitor 1, also known as B7-H4 and plays critical roles in regulating T cell-mediated immune response through inhibiting T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and the development of cytotoxicity (PMID: 19641607, 12818166, 14568939). B7-H4 is highly expressed in various human tumors, including breast (PMID: 15756008, 15878339), ovarian (PMID: 19955922), lung (PMID: 16782226, 23874109), pancreatic (PMID: 25170273), gastric (PMID: 20872810, 21748517) and urothelial cell carcinoma (PMID: 25400757, 25364421). Soluble B7-H4 (sB7-H4) has been detected in blood samples from various cancer patients, including ovarian (PMID: 16452214, 17490732), gastric (PMID: 24947047), lung (PMID: 25636447), renal cell carcinoma (PMID: 18676826), bladder urothelial carcinoma (PMID: 25364421), hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 25963168) and high levels of sB7-H4 were a significant prognostic indicator.

    "WIF1 deletion mutations typically result in the loss of protein expression. In vitro studies with WIF1-knockdown osteosarcoma cell lines demonstrate that loss of WIF1 is inactivating as measured by increased colony formation and cellular viability compared to control (PMID: 19307728)",
    "WIF1 is an extracellular lipid-binding protein that functions as a WNT antagonist (PMID: 10201374, 24316024, 23258168). WIF1 functions as a negative regulator of the WNT signaling pathway by binding to WNT or Frizzled (Fz) receptors and precluding WNT-mediated activation of downstream signaling (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). WNT signaling is a critical developmental pathway with roles in determining cell fate, tissue identity and polarity (PMID: 28218291). WIF1-mediated antagonism of WNT results in the activation of the β-catenin destruction complex (containing APC, GSK3β and AXIN), which targets β-catenin for degradation (PMID: 23258168). In the absence of WNT signaling, TCF and LEF transcription factors form a repressive complex, leading to inhibition of β-catenin target genes (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). In addition to roles in antagonizing WNT, WIF1 has roles in mesodermal specification, cellular senescence, tissue homeostasis and proliferation (PMID: 24853424, 10201374, 30574494). Germline mutations in WIF1 have been found in families with a predisposition to cancer, as well as in patients with Nail-Patella syndrome (PMID: 25716654, 28383544). Somatic mutations in WIF1 are not well studied in human cancers; however, rare alterations are found in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (PMID: 23292937). Epigenetic silencing of WIF1 transcription and WIF1 overexpression have both been implicated in distinct cancer types, suggesting that WIF1 may function as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in different cellular contexts (PMID: 20596629, 26291085, 25432628, 15579438). Fusion proteins involving WIF1 are also found in adenomyoepitheliomas, a rare breast cancer, and in salivary gland tumors (PMID: 30675516, 17171686, 18828159).",
    "The EWSR1-WT1 fusion is a t(11;22)(p13;q12) chromosomal translocation where the EWSR1 exon 7 fuses to the WT1 exon 8.

    "WT1 (Wilms tumor 1 gene) is a transcription factor expressed in a tissue-specific manner throughout development (PMID: 20013787, 17524167, 17361230, 12835718). WT1 has been implicated in the protein stabilization of TP53 and regulates the expression of several target genes include MYC and BCL2, which are important for cellular growth and metabolism (PMID: 7585606, 8389468). In hematopoietic cells, WT1 interacts with the epigenetic proteins TET2 and TET3 that regulate hydroxymethylation of DNA, an epigenetic modification of DNA that may also serve as a methylation state intermediate (PMID: 25482556). Loss of WT1 expression results in depletion of global 5-hydroxymethylation levels (PMID: 25482556), implicating WT1 in the regulation of DNA methylation. WT1 was initially discovered as a tumor suppressor in Wilms’ tumor (PMID: 2163761, 9090524); however, WT1 loss only contributes to the pathogenesis of a fraction of Wilms' tumors (PMID: 16110318). Somatic WT1 mutations have been identified in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are predicted to be loss-of-function, leading to decreased DNA binding activity (PMID: 25482556). Importantly, TET and IDH family mutations are mutually exclusive with WT1 mutations in AML patients, suggesting that WT1 functions as a regulator of DNA methylation (PMID: 25482556). Patients with WT1 mutations may be increasingly sensitive to hypomethylating agents, such as azacytidine, due to the role of WT1 in the regulation of methylation (PMID: 27252512). WT1 is overexpressed in a large percentage of patients with myeloid and lymphoid leukemias (PMID: 27252512, 16461320, 15084694). Vaccines that target overexpression of WT1 are currently in clinical development (PMID: 23486779, 26389576).",
    "WWP1 (WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates diverse processes in the cell, including protein trafficking and signaling (PMID: 22051607). WWP1 is responsible for mediating the polyubiquitination of PTEN. When polyubiquitinated, PTEN is prevented from dimerizing, localizing to the membrane and functioning as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 31097636). Thus, WWP1 is responsible for PTEN inactivation. WWP1 is also involved in TGF-beta signaling by regulating the degradation of Smad2 (PMID: 15221015). WWP1 knockout in cell lines leads to decreased colony formation and increased apoptosis compared to wildtype, while xenograft tumors carrying WWP1 mutations exhibit increased growth rate compared to wildtype (PMID: 31097636, 32459922). WWP1 is amplified and/or overexpressed in breast, prostate and gastric cancers, among others (PMID: 17330240, 17016436, 25293520). Germline WWP1 variants are enriched in patients with Cowden syndrome and patients with PTEN-related cancers including colorectal adenocarcinoma and thyroid cancer (PMID: 32459922).",
    "The WWTR1 gene encodes the WWTR1/TAZ protein, a transcriptional coactivator involved in the Hippo signaling pathway (PMID: 26045258, 25266986). TAZ, which shares homology and function with the Yes-associated protein (YAP), is able to translocate to the nucleus and interact with TEAD1-4 to activate a transcriptional program that promotes cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (PMID: 11118213, 18227151, 19324877). The Hippo signaling pathway negatively regulates TAZ function via LATS1/2 phosphorylation, which prevents TAZ nuclear translocation (PMID: 18227151). WWTR1/TAZ is considered a novel oncogene in breast and lung cancer (PMID: 18413727, 21258416). WWTR1 is amplified in several tumors, such as lung, ovarian and head and neck cancer (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016). Cancers with defective Hippo signaling pathway and subsequent TAZ activation are good candidates for novel small-molecule Hippo modulator drugs (PMID: 27262779, 24336504).",
    "XBP1 is a transcription factor that is an important regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (PMID: 28741511). XBP1 undergoes unconventional splicing after the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resulting in the activation of UPR (PMID: 28741511). The function of the UPR is to stop protein translation, degrade abnormal proteins, and increase chaperone production in response to ER stress; otherwise, the cell is targeted for apoptosis (PMID: 21061914). The transmembrane protein IRE1α coordinates the splicing of XBP1 upon ER stress, resulting in a newly spliced transcript that contains a transactivation domain, which is critical for mediating UPR transcriptional activity in the nucleus (PMID: 28741511, 19609461). XBP1 has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions including adaptive immunity, innate immunity, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, DNA repair, lipid metabolism, cellular differentiation, and DNA replication, among others (PMID: 17612490, 21061914, 12612580). Variants in XBP1 have been linked to inflammatory bowel syndrome and Crohn’s disease (PMID: 18775308). Overexpression of XBP1 expression has been found in leukemias and breast cancers (PMID: 16491124, 19470730, 20028872). Increased XBP1 activity is important for the growth of tumor cells in hypoxic conditions (PMID: 15342372) and can mediate drug resistance (PMID: 17660348). Somatic mutations in XBP1 are found in patients with follicular lymphoma (PMID: 27959929), however, these alterations have not been functionally characterized.",
    "XIAP encodes for the gene X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, an anti-apoptotic protein belonging to the family of baculovirus IAP domain repeat-containing proteins (PMID: 25065885). The IAP domain mediates anti-apoptotic activity by binding and inhibiting caspases and is blocked by SMAC protein binding (PMID: 9230442, 11242052). XIAP also contains a RING domain that mediates ubiquitination through E3 ligase activity (PMID: 15803136, 18708583). It regulates Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response, MAPK signaling, copper metabolism, and cellular differentiation (PMID: 24975362, 24497535, 20154138, 19011619, 23928917). In cancer, XIAP can mediate resistance to therapy (PMID: 23727860, 22491673, 11280739, 12384799). Gerrmline mutations are associated with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome characterized by lymphohystiocytosis, hypogammaglobulinaemia, lymphomas, and immune disorders (PMID: 17080092, 23973892).

    "XPC encodes for a DNA damage repair factor which functions as a DNA binding component of the XPC-RAD23B complex (PMID: 10873465, 20028083, 20798892). The XPC-RAD23B complex is a part of the nucleotide excision repair mechanism and recognizes DNA lesions to initiate DNA repair (PMID: 33035795, 31372632). Germline mutations of XPC are associated with the autosomal recessive disease xeroderma pigmentosum, resulting in a decreased ability to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet rays (PMID: 27413738). Knockdown of XPC in various cancer cell lines and models induces tumor formation, oxidative DNA damage and cellular proliferation and migration, suggesting that XPC functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 21763452, 9540983, 25871391). Downregulation of XPC has been identified in various types of cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma (PMID: 20616346, 17575131).",
    "The XPO1 C528S mutation is located in the cargo-binding groove of the XPO1 protein.

    "The XPO1 (Exportin 1) encodes a protein that mediates nuclear export of proteins and RNA (PMID: 9323132, 10786834). XPO1 recognizes proteins containing a nuclear export signal (NES) and leads to their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. XPO1 has been reported to be involved in ribosome biogenesis by exporting the 60S ribosome subunit through binding to NMD3 (PMID: 26048327, 12724356). In the context of cancer, XPO1 has oncogenic properties. This has been mostly attributed to the fact that proteins exported by XPO1 include important tumor suppressors (eg. APC, TP53, SMARCB1 etc.)(PMID: 12070164, 11782423, 17891139, 20803015). High nuclear XPO1 expression is associated with adverse prognosis in various tumor entities (PMID: 18306389, 19082467, 20003838) and XPO1 mutations have been reported in some cases of chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) as well as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (PMID: 21642962, 26608593). XPO1 translocations have been reported in T-ALL (PMID: 25377562).

The protein participates in the base excision repair pathway through interactions with DNA ligase III, DNA polymerase beta, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (PMID: 31324530, 35055077, 36573562). XRCC1 has essential roles in microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) repair of double-strand breaks and replication fork restart in the absence of BRCA2 (PMID: 31324530, 35055077). Mutations in the gene have been associated with neurological disorders and cancer predisposition as a result of unrepaired DNA damage (PMID: 35055077).

RAD51 acts at an early step in the DSB pathway: the 5’ended DNA strands flanking the DSB break site are resected and the single-stranded overhangs are coated by RAD51 forming a nucleo-protein filament (PMID: 25833843). XRCC2 is a member of the BCDX2 complex that includes the RAD51 paralogs RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D. The BCDX2 complex stabilizes the sites of damaged DNA and recruits RAD51 to initiate strand repair by homologous recombination (PMID: 9126486, 10517641). Knockdown of XRCC2 activity in cell line and murine models results in a 100-fold decrease in DSB repair function through defective homologous recombination repair (PMID: 10517641, 14678973, 14645207, 24627042). There is conflicting data on whether germline variants of XRCC2 increase the risk of breast cancer (PMID: 22464251, 23054243, 12023982, 17141189) and XRCC2 is infrequently mutated in human cancers.",

    "YAP1 is a transcriptional co-activator and downstream effector of the Hippo pathway. The Hippo pathway is involved in several processes of cancer progression and physiologically has important regulatory functions in organ development and regeneration (PMID: 23467301, 24825474, 24336504). YAP1 largely mediates the downstream transcriptional effects of Hippo signaling (PMID: 20951342) by shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In the nucleus, YAP1 induces expression of proliferative and anti-apoptotic genes via interactions with transcription factors, namely TEAD family members (PMID: 20951342). Hyperactivation of YAP1 leads to contact-inhibition, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metastatic potential and stem cell defects (PMID: 17974916, 24336504, 25702974). Germline mutations in YAP1 have been identified in patients with coloboma, a familial disorder resulting in ocular defects (PMID: 24462371). Overexpression of YAP1 is widespread in human cancer; however, somatic mutations are rare (PMID: 25592648, 24336504). Reports of YAP1 gene amplification and epigenetic activation in cancer support the role of YAP1 as a classic oncogene (PMID: 25592648, 24336504). YAP1 fusions have also been identified in ependymomas (PMID: 29258295). Although YAP1 behaves as an oncogene in most cancers, data suggest that YAP1 can also act as a tumor suppressor in certain cellular contexts (PMID: 24976009, 22234184). Overexpression of YAP1 has been associated with resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors (PMID: 25665005). Verteporfin, a small molecule inhibitor that targets the YAP1-TEAD interaction, has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models of YAP1 overexpression and is synthetic lethal with MEK and BRAF inhibition (PMID: 29299145).",

Following activation, YES1 phosphorylates various substrates, including CDK4 and PAR3 to control cell cycle progression and regulate cell-cell adhesion (PMID: 18479465, 17053785). Additionally, YES1 stimulates chemokine-directed T-cell migration by phosphorylating collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), promotes cell migration through activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and induces apoptosis in hepatocytes through its participation in the CD95L signaling pathway (PMID: 19276087, 21713032, 15917250). YES1 plays a central role in malignant mesothelioma cell growth (PMID: 22948717) and has been shown to act as an oncogene in several tumor models through increased expression and kinase activity (PMID: 7690925, 9816313, 17007035, 7690926).

ZBTB20 is most highly expressed during hippocampus development and in mature endocrine cells (PMID: 26782407, 27079169). Deletion of ZBTB20 in mice results in decreased secretion of pituitary growth hormones, such as prolactin (PRL), and loss of mature lactotrope cells in the anterior pituitary (PMID: 26782407, 27079169). ZBTB20 directly binds the promoter of PRL and activates transcription (PMID: 27079169) and PRL overexpression has been implicated in ZBTB20-dependent models of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (PMID: 31570595). Expression of ZBTB20 is important in immune regulation in B cells, including in plasma cell differentiation and longevity (PMID: 29616049, 24711583, 23776228). The deletion of ZBTB20 in murine models can result in long-term antibody defects (PMID: 29616049).

    "ZRSR2 encodes a splicing factor U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor 35 kDa subunit-related protein 2. It is involved in the splicing of introns and is important for recognizing the 3' splice site and assembly of the spliceosome (PMID: 21041408). Mutation in hematopoietic cells results in mis-splicing and retention of the U12 type intron in pre-messenger RNA (PMID: 25586593). Mutations are found in myelodysplastic syndrome, secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and other myeloid dysorders (PMID: 22389253, 25550361, 25212276). Targeted inhibition of the spliceosome may be a therapeutic strategy in spliceosome mutant disease (PMID: 26575690)."
