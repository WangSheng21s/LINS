<h1> LINS: A Professional Medical Q&A Framework for Enhancing Knowledge Privacy and Timeliness</h1>

We developed LINS, a general medical Q&A framework that can seamlessly adapt to any medical field without additional training or fine-tuning. We introduced the Multi-Agent Iterative Retrieval Augmented Generation (MAIRAG) algorithm and the Keyword Extraction Degradation (KED) algorithm to help LINS generate Citation-Based Generative Text (CBGT). LINS achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both subjective and objective evaluations on specialized medical datasets. Additionally, LINS supports keyword extraction, retrieval of the latest knowledge, and assists in evidence-based medical practice. It can also easily integrate with local knowledge bases without additional training or fine-tuning. In summary, LINS is a multifunctional, highly professional, privacy-protecting, and up-to-date medical Q&A framework with broad application value in the medical field. It is expected to promote the application and development of large language models in medicine, thereby improving the efficiency of related professionals.
